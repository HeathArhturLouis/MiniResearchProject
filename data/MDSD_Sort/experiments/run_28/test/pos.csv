 Well i am intersted in buying the book , however i would like to have some further information.  Could you send me some further information please? Thank yo 
 I've seen this movie on TV a few years ago, but it just wouldn't leave my mind, so I ordered the DVD. It's one of those movies you won't forget, because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach', as Mitchell calls it. Morrie is a great coach, and if you watch this movie, you will see why it is so heartbreaking. An old, wise man, a long lost friend, who teaches the last course in his life. At home. One student. A must have seen 
 Very well layed out,informative,excellent reference, yet easy to understand, assists with the learning of translation of some of the more common Hieroglyphics, especialy with tombs, ushabtis and other artefacts.  "Gardiner's Sign List" was very well presented 
 This really is a great book.  I am no longer a "young adult," but I enjoyed it 
 These tales began as Jean Shepherd's improvised radio stories. Then he wrote them--and published them in Playboy and in two of his books. Then they made the movie, which he narrated and in which he had a cameo role. At every permutation these are hilarious gems, to be laughed over, time after time.  But there's a lot more to Jean Shepherd than A CHRISTMAS STORY. He was recently inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame. To discover the whole creative and enigmatic world of Shepherd, read the book:  EXCELSIOR, YOU FATHEAD! THE ART AND ENIGMA OF JEAN SHEPHERD. (I wrote it. This is a shameless commercial. 
 Not sure what these other reviews are talking about.  I really like ours, and it seems very sturdy.  Great price and easy to put together.  I love mine and it looks great 
 I found this film very interesting and thought provoking.  It is the perfect movie to watch on a dark raining night.  Scary and it reminded me of a gothic tale of old.  Loved the costumes.  It is also a perfect movie for a "movie" club, to discuss 
 Little SAS Book is a wonderful starter on SAS . It's  simply a great book that every SAS analyst should keep a copy of . I read it first in 2001  and was   impressed with the content flow and description. Recently I had  to conduct a SAS training and I cannot explain how much useful the second reading was to refresh my own knowledge.   It skips lots of practical use of SAS like automation or reporting with excel as a delivery channel. Also less information is found on how to work with data warehouses or SQL specific help. Anyone who is new to SAS must read this first to last and try out all exercises. That will really improve his/her comfort level . Also recommended for Base SAS certifications.    
 As an art historian, museum curator, and traveler to France I found this book very useful.  Most books on Gothic Architecture look at style as though it exists for its own sake. Simson  places the beginnings of Gothic  Architecture into the intellectual and historical context that gave this  archetectual style its birth.  The two sections that I most enjoyed were  the theology of light that Suger was trying to express through architecture  and the historical/political life of Suger.  Both of these elements had a  profound effect on the developement and impact of the Abby Church of St.  Denis.  This book represents architectural history as it should be written.   Simson's approach is only possible because of his ability to draw upon a  broad and deep educational framework.  Reading this book caused me to  lament the shallowness of much of what passes for scholarly training and  writing in our time.  You don' t have to be an architectural historian to  enjoy this book.  But you should be passionate about ideas.  Simson shows  us how ideas have consequences.  This is one of the best books I have ever  read 
 The book Goldylocks and the Three Bears was a very good book. The book was about a family of three bears who decided to go on a picnic. There's first a big papa bear, then a medium mama bear, and then there is a little baby bear. Then Goldylocks comes trottying along and Stumbles upon the three bears's home. She sees that no one was in the house so she decides to go right ahead on in. Then she eats the bears food, breaks one of there chairs, and falls asleep in baby bears bed, and of course they catch her. I always loved reading this book for some reason, maybe because it takes place in the blackwoods of Germany. This book is a definate read for all children. No child should go with out three little bears, it's a classic 
 I enjoyed this book a lot.  The Tower of High Socerey is very interesting indeed and a place I found myself wanting to visit but was never allowed to with the other books...prepare to goto the heart of the Tower!  Yes I forewarned you be terrified 
 Nostromo is one of Conrad's finest works and is also one of the few which is set upon land. It was published in 1904 and concerns primarily the corrupting influence of money or in this case silver. The novel is set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana. We learn of a local legend in the province of Sulaco about the disappearance of two thieving `gringos' who haunt the mountains due to their greed. We meet Charles Gould, who controls a silver mine and is trying to save it from the corrupt government. It is a time of political unrest and the dictator Ribiera flees. In this atmosphere, Gould becomes obsessed with saving the silver from the mine and emplys Decoud and Dr Monygham to aid him. They turn to Nostromo, a popular hero of sorts, who sails with the Decoud to hide the treasure but disaster strikes and they collide with an enemy boat. They arrive on an island and Decoud remains to protect it. However, he goes insane alone on the island and shoots himself before drowning, tied to a great quantity of silver. As the novel progresses we focus on Nostromo's unwise romance with his friend Viola's daughters. It contains very perceptive portraits of both heroes and anti-heroes and of the guilt that punishes the selfish, the greedy and the foolish. Many consider it to be Conrad's most important novel.   Not a walk in the park but, you will be happy you took the time to read.  It reminds me of the time I had my first sailboat I named it "Earls Pride" and me da bought me a fine looking mesh ball cap that said the same over the bill, I still have the hat and I do not think any amount of time will pass that will bring the hat back into fashion, its just plain ugly. Tacky and ugly and you will have to pull it off of my cold dead head if ever want to posses the...thing.   My friend Deemont called me one time and wanted to know if I would take his new girlfriend and himself sailing, I said yeah. So we met at Eagle Creek Reservoir and the wind was so strong that I judged it not safe for all of us to sail together for my craft was small, 13 ft. stem to stern.  So we discussed the situation and Deemont laughed and told me how he met his new gal. The story goes she worked for a phone soliciting company and one of her employees called him and he used profanity and hung up on her, well her boss was appalled and call Deemont back to set him straight and well...he asked her out and that's how they met. I don't recall her name but I do know she was wearing Daisy Duke style shorts, she drew the long straw (turned out to be the short straw as fate would have it) and we went for a sail. I only raised the Jib sail since the winds were so severe, well we probably made it 100 yards from the docks, the wind shifted we turtled the "Earls Pride" (rolled it over mast down) well we gathered all our stuff and I coached her on the entire routine of righting a turtled sailboat, but then the wind would catch us and back over we would go. On and on this continued, occasionally we would right the craft and sail for a while (at which time I figured out from my keen powers of observation she had no underclothes under her daisy dukes) finally we just headed for shore drug the boat up on the beach where Deemont stood laughing.He had driven down to the next boat launch to find us, and helped us walk it along the shore back to the dock and later confessed to me that he was not so much concerned about our drowning but whether she was keeping her dukes in place and me the same. I don't know why especially since Nostromo took place on dry land but everytime I read this novel I think of this little adventure on Eagle Ocean. 
 This is a great reference book for those charged with configuring ,customizing and extending Microsoft CRM Version 3.0 to meet the needs of your or your client's business.  It contains a lot of real-world examples, and code snippets that can be used as an aid to understanding.  I found it was also a great resource in preparing for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 Customization exam (CRM-30-422).   Highly recommended. 
 This book was just excellent.  Read everything you can get your hands on that's written by Sarah Mason 
 Jury of the Heart is incredibly powerful, a stamp of Bacon at her peak. The tale is wholly transgressive, and a reader has to be comfortable with their sexuality in order to fully credit this mid-length short. Liam Keen's story is as much emotionally packed as it is raw with unusual therapy. Wow, what a wow. 
 Nice CD, but of the Sinatra of a different time.  I have a recent one that I received this past Christmas, when he was older, but full of fun, and wise cracks, as it is in a club for the most part, but he still was in great form, and not inhibited at all!  On this, he sings very well, and it is lovely, but he is much more subdued, and I sort of like the Sinatra of the "Rat Pack" stage -- uninhibited, and right on 
 My first thought upon finishing this book was echoed someplace by another reviewer: "God Bless You, M Revel". I read it a second time just because it felt good. I've lived in the Soviet Union, and spent years in Western Europe 'but, but, butting' them too. Revel is such an apologist for the United States, it's almost embarrassing, but I agree with him completely about what's going on in Europe. He sees it so clearly, and nails it right on the head without apology or equivocation.  Revel was editor of the French political weekly L'Express and is a member of the Academie Franaise 
 How to describe this CD?  It's hard. I've said before that Meshell is a genius and a true artist in everyway.  I don't think she could ever put out a bad album.  Her heart and soul is poured into everything she does.  It infuriates me when I ask people if they listen to her and they are clueless of who I'm talking about.  How is that possible?  But upon further pondering, Meshell's music isn't exactly commerical.  Each song is a part of a masterpiece which is the entire album.  Take one song out and a listener could be lost.  Nah, radio are just a bunch of punks and are cheating their listeners from some great music.  End of story.  This is a great C 
 Good Bead paterns alot of pictures of beadwork from 1800's (5 stars) for the detailed information in this book 
 This is one of my favorite books. Every class I've ever used it with, from 1st grade up to 5th, has been fascinated. The illustrations are eye catching and perfectly correspond to the text. Literature should be intergrated across the curriculum. This book can help introduce lessons on big numbers and place value. It can also be used to tie into science lessons, with the size of the solar system or animal species. All elementary classrooms should have a copy of this book. It is both educational and interesting 
 Maybe even a 4.5.  Not as comprehensive as "The Best Short Stories of...", but it's a good intro to Ballard's work.  It gives a first-time reader a good idea of what to expect.  Ballard writes some  top-notch stories (The Drowned Giant, Bilennium, Deep End - all included  here), but in his collections, they always seem to get diluted by the  not-so-greats.  Still, the majority of the stories in this book are quite  good; more forward-thinking and original than anything that came out of  that period.  I think the best quality of his stories is that they deal  with societal concerns, and not just sci-fi.  Quite an enjoyable book 
  What a great little book! The authors take the time to explore spiritual questions, rather than simply rushing to answers; and each writes with a humor, honesty and humility that I enjoyed and appreciated.    The daily readings are refreshing and challenging - providing a unique and interesting mix of scripture, creed and thoughts on faith.  I used the book as devotional reading and have returned several times to chapters like "What About When Doubt Overshadows Belief?" and "Will Life Ever Be the Way It's Supposed to Be?"    I'm grateful to have this book - and have already given copies to friend 
 "Living in Oblivion" is one of those unassuming, low-circulation titles that make you wish your fellow citizens had more taste in cinema because then perhaps Hollywood would try making smarter films more often. Although, at the same time, you're almost glad they don't so you can hoard all these great movie experiences for yourself. The movie, in a nutshell, is about the agony and frustration of trying to make a low-budget film about a woman who was abused as a child and who is about to get married to someone she works with. Steve Buscemi, as the director, tries his damnedest to get the scenes to work, but instead is stymied at every turn: technical difficulties; incompetence by his crew; personal problems with his actors and the his crew; an obnoxious dwarf; and of course, past-its-expiration-date milk. It's these annoyances and hindrances that bring out the best scenes in the movie -- the "real" movie and the "in-production" movie. Buscemi gets to do a couple of his signature explosive outrages, like the Tasmanian Devil, only more coherent and quite a bit angrier (and less hair). Catherine Keener, one of the most underrated actresses in the business today, is smartly sensitive yet brutally honest with her feelings; not quite as sarcastically vicious as she was in "Being John Malkovich" or "Death to Smoochy". Those two actors were ostensibly the reason I originally saw the movie, but I bought the DVD due to the movie's originality, cleverness and humor as a whole. The special features include a few deleted scenes (including one great musical bit with the dwarf actor, Peter Dinklage), and a college film class interview with Dicillo and Buscemi. A screen gem that will have you alternately roaring with laughter and appreciating the way a movie can hit your emotions and your mind in such a sweet, unsuspecting way 
 Russell was a keen and original thinker.  He and Whitehead wrote the Principia in an attempt to explain mathematics in terms of logic and put it on a firm logical basis.  This was proved impossible by Godel later in the century.  This book gives Russell's definitions and thinking on the subject, and discusses Frege and Cantor and Dekind and Hilbert and their approaches to mathematics and number system.  I find the book historically interesting, but I am not qualified to criticize the mathematics or axioms proposed in the volume 
 Fascinating anthropomorphic study. The book consists of various diary entrees of Carlos Casaneda  encounters with an elderly Indian Yaqui Sorcerer who takes him under his wing and makes him an apprentice to ancient secret teachings that paradoxically contain primitive ideas and rituals with profound concepts. This to be "a man of knowledge.".This book is truly a cultural-religious-spiritual study before the hippy, Leary, Pranskter movements. I think most would agree it is a profound study of both ordinary and non-ordinary realities. What makes this so interesting is the simplicity of a primitive culture that contains hidden variables of deep meanings  which are beyond our modern superficial Western culture that brags of it's technology and materialisms. We may have the sciences to manipulate raw materials but we are seriously lacking.  In this book, there are pre-agreements made directly and alluded to before experimentation using three separate hallucinatory plants; Jimpson Weed, Peyote and Mushrooms, each plant representing a very different perception of non-ordinary reality, from power and ally to helper. The ideas agreed on are done with the skill of Don Juan, where one expects a particular paradigm prior to ingestion, truly psychology at work. If such teachings were not given special prior consensus than interpretations would be entirely different. The whole process of teaching takes much time - years-  and there are serious ritual preparations involved.   The majority of the book contains diary entries, while the later is a structural analysis of the events. It is all written very well and surprising when reading the second portion how intense all the ideas really are. Now this book is the first of a series of 15 books that further these teachings. While to some the idea of speaking to a Mescalito to show one the right way, to turning into a crow or fighting off an enemy trying to take your soul may see absurd or insignificant superstition but the deeper implications of the mind here are assessed and there is a psychology that ventures in deeper plains than mere doctrinal formulations and surface meanings 
   Undoubtedly this book has gone a long way to perfect herself  but certain gross errors exist , an example being an opening shap being mentioned as a "low pitched" sound (along with S3 and  mid diastolic murmur) in page 307 and a picture of Herpes Zoster being labelled as Herpes Simplex in page 137 .    Considering the size of the book, the hardbound cover  and the way of presentation,the coverage should be so as to benefit postgraduates also by inclusion of certain finer and additional details even at the cost of a mild increase in size.    The lucid explanations and clear illustrations are definitely invaluable and make the book outstanding in its field.    The few corrections can always be undertaken.

 This was my first Dirk Pitt adventure. I must say he is quite the hero. Just ask all the characters with whom he came in contact throughout the story. I'd rather make my own judgement on his greatness based on his actions, words and thoughts - not through conversational praise by fellow cast members.  That said, I found myself lost in the world of terrorist plot driven action. Pages flew by - as did my destination train station on occasion. I suppose that constitutes a good story? It was such a large plot, with many possibilities, however, the most interesting sub-plot - that being the significance of the ancient treasures - was neglected in order to jam in some action or political banter. Expect to roll your eyes once or twice at Mr Cussler's and Dirk's audacity. Some things are just not believable. Which I don't mind, except under the greater guise of plausibility. By way of comparison, most Alistair Maclean heroes are more likable than Mr Pitt if not more realistic. Push these points aside if you can and you'll enjoy the story.  I enjoyed this book, I know this because I found myself yearning for it at various times throughout the day. That and the fact that I went out immediately and bought another of Mr Cussler's titles. For me, that's all I look for in a book - which is why I would recommend it to anyone.  
 I am by no means a technical person.  This drive was easy to set up and use right away.  The software that came with it was easy to use as well 
 The overall feel off this LP is much more laid back and interesting then all of the previous releases. Gone is the garage rock sound, replaced with pleasent tones reflecting folk, country, and rock textures. I am  one of the few early underground FM dj's currently operating on KDHX-FM 88.1 St. Louis -Time Warp Radio Thursdays 4am-6am CST (streaming at KDHX.ORG). This is a CD that I can play most all of the cuts off of. Great job AKARM 
 This production of Alice in Wonderland is pretty fabulous.  I loved it as a child.  It has a lovely mix of classic stars (Sammy Davis Junior, Imogene Coca) and flavors-of-the-month from the mid-80s (Pat Morita, John Stamos).  It would make a great DVD set 
 Legends of the Fall is a sclocky movie but it had one saving grace: the music. This is a gorgeous soundtrack and the Ludlow, Wedding, and Samuel's death tracks are particularly moving. 
 This book was great! It is about time people in the spot light show some honesty and own their own lives! Paula is a REAL person. She is our neighbor, and friend. She makes me proud of myself and the mistakes I have made because I see that she has made mistakes as well. What an amazing lady. She shares some great recipes as well in this book 
 If you are planning a wedding, this is a great resource.  It is full of ideas covering off so many different areas, including rings, ceremonies, cakes, flowers etc.  The gorgeous presentation makes it an item to keep forever.  
 Professor Yates presents this subject matter, which may be somewhat confusing at first blush, in a manner that is easy to understand. This approach is very different from other texts, particularly those geared toward mathematicians, which tend to be overly terse and abstract 
 I love this drink. It's a bit of an acquired taste--I found it a little bit chalky, but I love it now. It's full of essential nutrients, so it's completely worth the cost. The chocolate flavor is by far the best in my humble opinion. I usually combine a cup (it comes with its own measuring cup) with a cup of skim milk and blend it. Mixing it together without a blender causes it to clump something awful, so a blender is definitely essential. I recommend pouring how much milk you intend to drink in the your designated drinking vessel first before you blend; the shake has a tendency to froth and this way you don't end up with excess sitting in the blender. Generally I've found that on the days that I have time to drink this shake (washing the blender in the morning can prove to be a bit much) I have more energy and just feel...healthier. You really can't go wrong with this drink. I found that drinking this as a meal replacement aid was very helpful in weight loss 
 All I can say is that this book is a must have for anyone planning to take up this incredible sport. Its full of great pictures and ilustrations that help you with all the basic procedures of paragliding. Not to mention its excellent quality, picture ilustrations, and binding. Have Fun!.. 
 I did not read this book because I was a CEO, an executive or director within a large corporation.  I read this book because I was an individual, a professional who needed very much to move his career to a whole new level of productivity, if it was to offer any real future to either me or my family... in terms of both personal and financial fulfillment.  This book was a powerful journey of self discovery.  It really shakes up your notions about what you think works and what doesn't.  It enabled me to clearly see for the first time that the very approach that I had used to produce some outstanding and exceptional results and achievements within my career was incapable by its very design to allow the extraordinary or the impossible to happen.  That insight alone was golden because in a very primary way it provided the room for me to begin a new... to design anew... to reinvent the way in which I was relating and approaching my work.  It essentially began to reinvent me.  The book provided me with a structure of fulfillment - with very tangible tools - a way in which to access a new source of power and effectiveness. I cannot recommend it enough for those who find themselves, as I did, in the midst of a struggle with what they wish to achieve for themselves and within their careers 
 My daughter had talked about using Baby Sign Language to communicate with her infant son, who is now eight months old. She has had mild success, much to my surprise, but yesterday she invited me to stop by and observe the results she has achieved with her son after buying this new book, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Baby Sign Language" just two weeks ago.  She said that it was the best written book on the subject that she has seen. After perusing it myself, I could not agree more. Ms. Ryan has done a masterful job of presenting the subject in an easy-to-understand manner. Her infusion of humor in some places actually helps to lighten the instructional efforts. The illustrations are A+.  The proof was in the performance. My young grandson, who was just gurgles, smiles and wimpers a few weeks ago is now a full-fledged "signer", albeit in the early stages.  Grandparents, parents of new babies, parents-to-be, do your heir a favor and buy this book. It seems to me that the path from infancy to the "terrible twos" will be a happier path for readers who employ these easy-to-handle ideas 
 This EP contains 5 tracks, one of which is a shortened version of title track 'Xpander.' However, the four extended tracks average around 10 amazing minutes a piece, so DO NOT let the lack of tracks stop you from getting this disc immediately. This is arguabely Sasha's best work.....ranks right there with Involver and his GU Ibiza mix. But what those CDs lack, Xpander is absolute in......pure Sasha. Not too heavy on the trance elements, just enough breaks to make your head bump to the music, and overall brilliant production and arrangment from beginning to end on every single track. Xpander definitely tops Airdrawndagger for pure listening pleasure.   THE HIGHLIGHT: is by far 'Rabbitweed'. Xpander is amazing, but Rabbitweed takes it to that next level. If you ever find yourself in a slightly altered state of mind (one in which your capable of actually becoming the music) put on Rabbitweed in your car, turn up the bass, and just experience it. Follow that with Baja and you'll find yourself in near existential bliss of the purest form.  DEFINITE, DEFINITE, DEFINITE BUY FOR FANS OF SASHA & ELECTRONIC MUSIC IN GENERAL 
 I am in Healthcare IT area and I learned lots of insights about the problems of the healthcare industry from this book for excelling our product offer to physicians. Great Book Great Author.. 
 Read, re-read and re-read.  If you've read this book more than 10 years ago, you'll be amazed at its artistry and timeliness if you read it now.     I've read most every contemporary novelist who have renown for being among the best.  While quite a few of them deserve such encomium, quite a few of them do not.  To compare style, content, artistry, - then pure enjoyment with "To Kill a Mockingbird", none truly equal the work of Harper Lee.  It certainly should be on the required reading list of every high school in this country 
 A great treatise on war in general even though it pertains specifically to WW1.  Exposes hidden belief systems and undermines the mainstream political world view.  A fascinating study for those serious students of occult that should not be overlooked 
 This is certainly by far the best biography ever written on a very important figure in western American history. It is very well documented. Arrington does not skip the controversies, it is all layed out. I certainly came away with a greater understanding of Brigham Young. Leonard Arrington was the head of the Mormon churches hisorical department for years and had a great influence on many Mormon historians to write honest and concise history. My only criticism is sometimes Arrington overly discusses economics in Utah rather then other aspects of Brigham Youngs life. Overall though it is great!  
 Although Goldsmith was brilliant, he was not an easy man to know and to like, and his egoism and unevenness of character does come out in this book.  He was always misunderstood, as geniuses often are.  This book has assured Goldsmith a place high up in the literature food chain.  The theme of the book resembles somewhat the Book of Job from The Bible.  Our hero is a good and innocent man who remains steadfast in faith and unbroken in courage as he faces numerous disasters.  It is a story about the family Primrose and its fall from it's a place of comfort and security.  The family consists of a mother and father and six children.  Mr. Goldsmith's genius is in characterization, as well as his ability to evoke a pure goodness of heart and warmth and generosity of people of simple faith and warm generosity.  This little book is truly a masterpiece. 
 Even though the book was used, it was in excellent condition.  The pictures throughout help to make this book a very good purchase for the money.  James Herriot is a wonderful storyteller and the reader finds himself/herself able to have the experience of almost being there in person 
 Holly Hollenbeck's "Sex Lives of Wives" is an outstanding real-world exploration of a subject more commonly (and boringly) explored by dry, analytical therapists.  This book connects with what i'm sure so many couples experience in their lives and offers some very interesting viewpoints and ideas.  Because Ms. Hollenbeck is writing as a wife and mom instead of as a psychologist or marriage counselor, you never feel that she was preaching or talking down to you.   In fact, I saw the author on The Today Show and even in person she's a very real person and you can tell that she's followed her own advice, and apparently with very pleasant results!  It's also nice that the author lives in the midwest rather than in LA or New York because we get a real feeling for what MOST people are going through rather than a 'select' group of atypical individuals.  The common belief is that relationships are 'work' and I guess they are, but "Sex Lives of Wives" shows how that 'work' can (and SHOULD) be fun.  It's a how-to in the best sense and I recommend it to anyone, even if you're not currently in a long-term relationship.    
 I take it everywhere I take my cards. This books is absolutely amazing. It covers every possible question you might have. Over 100 different spreads. Differeniates the meanings of every single card according to the category of the question: financial, relationship, work, family, spiritual .. everything. Perfect for a beginner and for a pro 
 It's amazing to me how few Americans have even heard of Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson (should I mention he was a Democrat!). I myself only had a vague idea of his role in the financing of the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation. George Crile, III, brings his story, and that of Gust L. Avrakotos, died a few years back at 67, the CIA agent in charge of the largest covert operation in CIA history--the arming of Afghani tribesmen during their 1980s guerrilla war--boldly to life. As entertaining as it is informative, every educated being on the planet should read this book to gain a better understanding of what exactly goes on behind the scenes as one crisis after another shapes the world we live in. Sadly, Mr. Crile died on May 15, 2006, of pancreatic cancer 
 Despite the subject matter, this book actually skews a bit older than one might suppose.  The characters and humor will appeal to the 8-11 year old, if they can still acknowledge that they love stuffed animals. Wonderful pithy dialogue captures the foibles of the buffalo, a favorite bath-towel, plastic (!) and the somewhat flawed personality of stingray. My daughter and I were sorry to see it end 
 I haven't used this camping, but I set it up in my living room as soon as I got it in the mail and it took about 2 minutes.  It looks great and I can't wait to try it out camping this summer with my family of five!!  I know exactly where I am going to put all of my camping dining essentials on this kitchen.  
 I'd read a few negotiation books in my time, but this one stands out most.   In business we don't burn bridges and this book is in congruent with my beliefs.  There are ways to win and win nicely.  There are books out there that talk about bare knuckles negotiation to my way or the highway.  Shapiro rightly pointed out that if you do that the opposite side would keep a lookout for a window to come around and make you bleed, very badly.  Don't.   Coz I've gone down that path long time ago and have got the scars to show.  Good read.  If all negotiators read this book then negotiation would be easier turning people that need to do this into true gentlemen that obeys rules and look after each other interests.  A must read 
 Well, they blew themselves away with  A Predator's Portrait, an album they have not yet, and probably will never(judging by the direction they are going in now) top. This album takes everything there is to love about Swedish metal at the time, and combines it in to one vessel of awesomeness. While this does mean that much of it has been seen before, they combine it in such away that makes the album a work of art, rather than a mishmash of rip-offs. Yes kids, they have great song writing, now for the individual aspects of the music.  I'll start off with the vocals, something that has killed many a metal album for me. Speed Strid's vocals are definitely in the top 3 or 4 metal singers for my ears(the only singers who I think of that beat him off the top of my head are Killswitch Engage's first singer, Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt, and Devin Townsend) and they fit this album better than any of those three would. His understandable but still throat ripping screams are actually enjoyable, instead of something you have to endure to listen to the rest of the music, and his "clean" vocals rival Mikael Akerfeldt's(who makes an appearance on the title track), as he uses a very clear scream instead of the more lullaby style that most metal vocalists use for clean vocals. They also use the clean and death vocals going at the same time, which adds an odd catchyness to the song "The Analyst".  The guitars rival the best work of In Flames or At The Gates, with catchy riffs when they need them, melodic riffs that seem to accentuate the vocals and heavy death metal chugs when they are needed. Their solos are also something to compliment, as they fly straight in to them, then just when you think the song should move a long, it does, as they don't go off in to boring wankery.  The drums are somewhat standard for melo-death, though they fly in to bland double bass kicking that fades in to the back of your head much less than other bands, so when bass kicks are used it adds to the music instead of constantly being there.  The synths, instead of actually adding musically to the songs, are placed very far in to the background and give the songs nice textures and more depth than most metal albums have.  If you were too lazy to read this essay of a review, then I'll sum it up in one sentence(because I know a review that took me three sittings to actually finish might be a touch beastly to read):  A Predator's Portrait is quite simply the best melo-death album, and if you want to start listening to this great genre, I can't think of a better place to start 
 A interesting novel written by Danielle Steel about a couple named Marielle and Malcom who have their child Teddy abducted. The story takes place in the late 1930's around the time of the Lindbergh kidnapping. The first suspect is Marielle's first love Charles Delauney. When the trial begins, secrets unfold about Marielle and Malcom. Through all the turmoil, there is a happy ending 
 `Little Cakes' by professional writer and `cookbook archeologist' Susan Waggoner is a very pleasant discovery I am happy to recommend to all, especially occasional bakers who want to go just one step beyond the Duncan Hines and Betty Crocker packages to make cakes from scratch. In spite of the delightful watercolor illustrations dotting the dust jacket, I was expecting a weak effort on petit fours and other less than useful preparations. This especially in light of my recently having reviewed expert baker and baking writer Flo Braker's reissued `Sweet Miniatures'. I was very pleasantly surprised with what I found.  For starters `little cakes' in this book means primarily single layer cakes baked in an 8-inch square or round pan, with icing. There are plenty of recipes which can be adapted to two or three layers, and the author gives many suggestions for same, but the heart of the matter is cakes baked with a relatively small amount of batter for a relatively short time. Within those constraints, the variety of cakes presented in this delightful book is wide indeed. The basic types include silver cake, white cake, white chocolate cake, yellow cake, gold cake, genoise (French sponge cake), whipped cream cake, chocolate cakes, devils food cake, marble cakes, `German' chocolate cake, flourless chocolate cake, red velvet cake, pound cake, marble pound cake, butter pecan loaf, lemon pudding cake, orange cake, banana cake, grapefruit cake, pineapple upside-down cake, raisin spice cake, oatmeal cake, pumpkin cake, gingerbread, carrot  cake, walnut cake, spice cakes, sandwich cakes, tea cakes, ginger buttons, petit fours, icebox cakes, ladyfingers, and cheesecakes. I will be happy to forgive the author for including cheesecake (a cheese custard pie) and other non-caky desserts such as trifles and tiramisu, as she has successfully created a highly accessible source of good recipes for quick reference when you do not want to wade through a 600 page tome to find something quick for a last minute baking need.  The litany of cake types above is multiplied by pairing each type of `crumb' with an appropriate icing, of which Ms. Waggoner gives several such as whipped creams, lady Baltimore frosting, white decorator icing, basic vanilla icing, basic chocolate frosting, lavish fudge frosting, chocolate ganache, white chocolate buttercream, white chocolate meringue, basic cream cheese frosting, grapefruit frosting, powdered sugar glaze, quick-set fondant, browned butter frosting, peanut butter frosting, penuche frosting, and caramel icing. On top of these are recipes for fillings and syrups for `kicking things up a notch' to borrow a phrase from someone.  While Ms. Waggoner does not have the professional baking credentials of Flo Braker or Nick Malgieri or Gayle Ortiz or Gail Gand, she is no slouch when it comes to starting one out with excellent advice on how to go about baking a good, simple cake. As far as I can tell, she touches all the right bases and gives absolutely no spurious advice. Some practical folk may object to her ward against using an oil spray from an aerosol can to lubricate a pan. I suggest those folk go and read the ingredients on those little cans and realize that the `no fat added' advertising claim is based on a fuzziness in the labeling law which says that if the amount is less than 1%, it can be deemed zero. The wrapper or a stub end of a stick of butter will give no more fat and probably be a lot healthier. A huzzah for Ms. Waggoner on this point.  For those of us who bake cakes only about three or four times a year, I still recommend Ms. Waggoner's book, as it is a very entertaining read for foodies as well as being an exceptionally good quick reference for a wide variety of basic cake types. The very short biography on the dust jacket says Ms. Waggoner enjoys rummaging through old magazines and newspapers for recipes. Well, she has really put all that rummaging to good use. Before the recipe for each major classic recipe, there is a little story on the source and age of the recipe and where it has been between the time it was created and its appearance in this little book. There are even some references to that greatest of pastry chefs Antonin Careme who is credited with the invention of the strawberry charlotte russe.  It is a small point for a book of such high quality recipes, technique, and stories, but the book is also exceptionally well designed to be both pleasant to read and easy to follow when you are doing recipes. The watercolor illustrations contribute little to the appreciation of the end result, but they succeed in being very decorative.  I compared some of Ms. Waggoner's recipes to my favorites and I will not give up my Nick Malgieri recipes for carrot cake or gingerbread and I will not stop referring to Rose Levy Beranbaum or Shirley Corriher for advice on what went wrong with my genoise, and I will definitely go to Maida Heatter when I want a seriously impressive production, but I will definitely turn to Ms. Waggoner the next time I need something I can make quickly from the pantry of a very short trip to the local grocery store.  Highly recommended to all foodies, occasional bakers, and readers in general. 
 Every couple should own a copy of this book.  He provides practical advice that can be applied easily to our everyday lives.  It provides great insight for men and women.  Now if I could just get my husband to read it........ 
 Another great book with V.I. Warshawski.  Couldn't set it down.  Great plot lines.  Two lines going on at once.  I really enjoyed this latest book by Sara Paretsky 
 Girard's work in _Deceit, Desire & the Novel_ is a psychoanalytic approach to literary criticism.  It explores the relationship between the subject and object of desire, attributing the cause of desire to a third  party, the mediator.  He uses Proust, Dosteyvsky, Stendhal and Flaubert as  models.  Overall, it is engaging, easy to read and absolutely necessary for  anyone interested in critical theory 
 Judging by the title, this volume does not cease to disappoint. It's still very humorous at times, and very serious at others. Expect to see some blood and brain-twizzlers, because this will really fry your brain 
  This is probably the best introduction to the 'Way of Tea' - in English sources. While it recognises all the virtues associated with 'cha no yu' in its more celebrated or well known forms (e.g. Ura-senke etc.), it brings fresh emphasis to the spiritual dimensions of 'tea' - reminding us that cha-no-yu was inspired by - and went with, a Buddhist feeling for the totality of life, compressed - if you like, into the magic of the momentary. This is the 'Way of tea' you can enjoy in your own space (less space). Hirota-sensei isn't taking issue with the best representatives of cha-no-yu in Japan. Hisamatsu Shinichi, a well known author on Japanese culture, endeavoured to say similar things to a Japanese audience. It is not the formal requirements, but the spiritual requirements, which should be satisfied.          
 Many people have criticized Barefoot for making unsubstantiated claims about coral calcium. I am sure that this calcium doesn't work as effectively for everyone, but it sure worked for me(back pain) my mother,(arthritis), my friend, (pain in foot from diabetes), and as an energy booster to many of my friends. I can't say that it cures cancer. I only know of one guy who used it for that. He survived, but he was also taking other traditional treatments. But it has lowered my blood pressure, and done so much more it works 
 This book does give a good overview of Jung's ideas, and how the developed in his life and interior thought.  What I most love about this book, however is the feeling I came away with for Jung himself.  It made me feel that he was a deeply compassionate, openminded and rational man, if imperfect as all men.  Its greatness is that it puts a human face behind all of the science and ideas of his legacy, and gives the reader an insight of his own inner experience which one can relate to 
 These are an excellent fit, great material, good craftsmanship.  Especially for the price 
 In the past 2 months, we've bought about 100 children's books, increasing our selection for toddlers to over 250 and out of all of those, together with those I've read from other sources, I would rate this as one of the best, especially for our 28-month-old son who has a special love for music and dance (yes, I think all-around, it's even better than Gustav Mole).   The values in this book (including hard work, practice, humility and peace) are outstanding without being heavy-handed or even obvious, making it a great book for all young children.  The story and illustrations are sweet and charming 
 I have never read less- than- stellar reviews any where on the net of Dena and her albums including her latest-- but the two reviews  in here.  Critics of renown - all acclaiming Dena's superlative talent - voice and piano and arrangements.  Dena's assertive piano style perfectly balances  her crystaline  voice.  A Walk in the Park, I think is her strongest album yet, perfoming in her first piano trio format. Dena  has assembled a bit of an eclectic group of songs that range from Ellington's "The Lonely Ones" to John Lennon's iconic "Imagine." Also included are also several DeRose originals that prove her more a formidable composer and singer than many of her peers -- Diana Krall, Norah Jones, etc.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this eclectic album and all her previous  offerings.  Listening to this album was like being at her  concert which I recently attended. Many of these songs  were introduced at her sold-out concert,  
 I recently came across the title as cited by several different people as a book that was important in their life, and I'm grateful that I did. It encompasses all of the ideas expressed in many other books of its type, however it doesn't leave anything out, while addressing each topic in a succinct way. It is not new, and a few of the examples given will be dated. That doesn't lessen it's messages in anyway. 
 Questions about libido come up every day in clincal practice. . .and this book fits the need for a succinct resource / discussion of options in management. Every obgyn practitioner should read this book and have it available for patient education 
 If anyone had any doubts as to the relationship between the Saudi royal family and the Bush family, they need to read this book.  "House of Bush, House of Saud" explores the interconnected relationship of the Saudis and Bushes since the early seventies.  It goes through the history of the rise of both Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, which evidently was the result of aid from the United States.  "House of Bush, House of Saud" is a mixed tale of money, oil, and power that everyone should read.  This book is an important history lesson of both the United States and it's dealings with the Middle East, but also how the age of terrorism was born.  Most people would rather choose to see what they would like and that is not always the whole picture, so I implore all to read this book and find out for yourself.  The evidence is all there, all you have to do is look.  Knowledge is power! 
 So, there seem to be about two significant complaints with this edition. The first is that the actual films are split over two discs, and the second is the lack of Eleanor Coppola's documentary, Hearts of Darkness.  On the first complaint: switching the disks is no big deal. The place selected for the swap divides each film pretty evenly in half, and I find that the division serves as a useful intermission point. Apocalypse Now is such a huge film (original or Redux) that having a brief moment to go get a drink or perhaps use the restroom is a good thing. So, for me, at least, the films being stretched over two discs isn't really a problem.  On the other hand, the lack of Hearts of Darkness irks the completionist in me. In retrospect, however, I see that finding a VHS copy for a reasonable price is not difficult. I have not yet watched even half of the excellent special features available here.  The video quality of this set is fantastic. I have not seen the film any other way, but the images are amazingly crisp, clear, and devoid of grain or artifacts. The colors are bold and vibrant. The sound is just as good. I had little difficulty hearing what a character was saying, whether they be shouting something in the fray of battle, or whispering something in a terse silence.  The menus are easy to navigate, and the special features are very good. In particular, the deleted scenes offer an interesting look at some concepts that never left the cutting room floor. Personally, I felt that two deleted scenes in particular (The Tiger Cages and Special Forces Knife) would have added a lot to the overall value of the film. I'm glad that they are at least preserved for viewing here.  While it may be lacking the acclaimed documentary, this is a great DVD set. It allows you to experience two amazing films (the Redux is, if anything, more surreal than the original) with maximized quality. If you haven't seen these films yet, I urge you to give this Complete Dossier a look. 
 My background is basic alterations and sewing from commercial patterns since I am hard-to-fit, but this book explains what goes into the $10,000 dresses that is missing from the $100 dresses. It also goes into the history behind 'couture', which is very fascinating for the layperson. It covers basic clothes selection for your body type, since what looks good on full-figured but beautiful Queen Latifah would look odd on thin Paris Hilton, even in a size 2. It also describes how most fashions need to be adjusted for variations in the more average figures in order to hang right, but if done right, can hide your figure flaws and make a person look as glamourous as the Movie Stars on Awards night. With all the specialized fitting and  sewing techiniques it descibes, the book will at least sure help my $40 clothes items I make look more like professionally sewn $400+ items instead of something made in High School Home-Ec class.  
 These essays are rich in complexity and detail and are recommended for college-level students of Tolkien's writings: they discuss the history of his Middle-Earth world, from the concept of Elvish language and the structure of Elvish verse to Tolkien's lyric poetry. An excellent set of technical discussions on the inviting world of Tolkien 
 First and last, this is a great book.  It clearly explains one of the major economic theories of business cycles and goes on to apply it to the Great Depression.  The book is best suited to a college economics student, or to a layman willing to devote a considerable level of effort to understanding the subject, but it would not be a particularly difficult project for anyone who reads on a college level.  It should be noted that the book espouses ONE of the major economic theories of business cycles, the Austrian theory.  Since the book is well written, it is almost dangerous to a student going into it blindly--you are liable to become an Austrian economist!  Not that this is a bad thing, but you should realize there are other viewpoints.  I do think Rothbard is a bit monomaniacal in his devotion to Austrian theory at the exclusion of everything else, but that doesn't prevent this from being a great book 
 This is a great product.  The sound is great and I needed something portable for my car.  Don't forget to turn off the shuffle after turning off the speakers 
 The words Creative Cash caught my attention since I'm a creative person. Excellent book. Alot of great information. I accidentally came across this book while searching for something else and had to have it. It came in a nice timely manner and in excellent condition. This is my kind of book 
 Haha, just kidding. But this book truly is amazing. After reading it, I went on a quest to find more books by him, got my friend to read it, and she's fallen in love with him too. We both giggled like little girls on a halloween sugar rush everytime we finished reading something of his. But this one remains my favorite. So romantic, and silly, and hilarious and just beautiful. You will fall in love with Every single character. I was skeptical when i saw the way in which it was written, but I would have really missed out if I hadn't read it. Buy it right now 
 The first time that I encountered Christian and his pilgrimage was as a preface and a family favorite in the book Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. Unfortunately, it was not until twenty-something years later that I actually got around to reading the book itself. If I were you, I would not wait that long.  The first part of the current combined book appeared in 1678. Bunyan, a nonconformist Protestant minister who was imprisoned for preaching without a license, wrote at least the first part of the book in jail. The second part was first published in 1684. It is likely the most popular allegory ever written, and is still one of the best selling books of all time.  What makes it so popular? The obvious key to its popularity is its simple, crisp style. Even accounting for the language changes between the seventeenth century and now, it is not a struggle to read Progress and it flows well for the modern reader. Although the book is allegory, the characters are full of little realistic details that make them feel quite human. Incidentally, I was reading this book as I was walking some of the old pilgrimage trails of Europe and it was interesting to me how vivid and applicable his version of the pilgrimage experience is. The Slow of Despair rang remarkably true, as did characters such as Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wisdom.  The Oxford University Press edition is bound with a scholarly introduction which is, for a change, worth reading. It also came with explanatory notes and a glossary which were helpful for the modern reader who is not familiar with the everyday language of the period. 
 I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  This powder/foundation has THE best coverage out there!  I don't like to wear liqued foundation because it makes my skin feel real oily.  This powder foundation is better than any out there 
 My son received this as a gift for his third birthday. It has quickly become his favorite book. He insists on listening to the song and having me sing it to him. We both spread our arms out wide when the penguin does and his favorite part is the end "please?". It's really fun to read & sing & dance to - highly recommended 
    Walsh has written an excellent book that details what the plane that carries the President of The United States of America represents.From the first President to fly,FDR,to the present holder of the office;we are given a candid look at these men in an enviroment where they let down their guards and exposed their real personalities.  The book shows what the arrival and departure of this plane represents wherever it goes;whether in the US or abroad.   David Valdez ,a White House photographer who travelled with GWH Bush for 10 years put it this way."When you fly on that plan,you are representing the United States,and when you land,that huge 747 sits there as the flying embassy of the United States of America."   Although the book is a little slow for the first 50 or so pages,possibly because it covers the period prior to when the author was personally involved,1986.However;don't let that influence you,because the book gets better at that point,and when you reach the end,you'll wish it was much longer;at least that's how it was for me.   As you are introduced to the Presidents as they assume office,one after another;you'll see their personalities and how they reacted to events that took place and how each of them dealt with those who were close to them as well as those who had the distinct privelige to serve them.  You will be given an intimate look at those memorable events that the whole world followed.Especially,what went on in Air Force One when Johnson was sworn in after JFK was assassinated in Dallas,add why Jackie was so prominent in those pictures.Then,President Nixon's flight to California after his resignation.The games of Hearts Clinton craved ,the antics little of Amy Carter,as well as those of many adults ,while on board;but more than anything else; the inside look ,as the events unfolded on that unforgettable day of 9/11 when the United States was attacked by Terrorists.You will see how the power of the world's  greatest government operated from the confines of a single plane.   Probably what this author has excelled best at was to show how each of the Presidents,coming from various walks of life,and having very different personalities,all tried with the best of their abilities and depending on the challenges confronting,gave their all in serving their countries.Upon completion of their terms each returned to private life among their fellow citizens;each in their own way believing that they had done their best.All the world but especially the people of the United States owes all these men a great debt of gratitude.I am sure each of them felt it was ther privelige to serve and  that alone was its reward.   
 I am so glad I discovered Alesia Holliday! She is an awesome, talented, funny writer. Kirby is hilarious and endearing. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have fun and forget their troubles for a while. Get immersed in an Alesia Holliday book--it'll become a keeper on your shelves! 
 I recently bought a Canon Rebel 2000 and need a small simple book with guidelines on taking better pictures in a variety of different situations.  This book is WONDERFUL!!! Gives many "real life" examples and shows sample pictures of everything the author talks about. A must for anyone wanting to take better pictures 
 I have watched the seasons sequentially and this one had a bit of a different feel to it.  There was more than just one or two main challenges, so it seemed to put one more into the suspension of disbelief than the other seasons, if that is possible.  Jack is once again 'the man that does it all.'  And once again sacrafices love for his first love of adventure 
 I am not a classical person, but I happened to stumble upon these people and fell in love. Great album, amazing talent. It makes you want to learn the piano 
 Peter McLaren's book Life in Schools is among the very few texts in critical pedagogy that connects empirical to theoretical and everyday experiences to general ideas about schooling in an understandable manner. It builds its solid arguments in a humanist Marxist tradition, and stays firmly in our, the common people, side. It is a serious and honest book in which teacher's and student's everyday experiences are situated in a larger political context. It's a book for those of us who dare to teach, talk and think critically in these times of global terror 
 I am a third generation San Franciscan and history buff. I really enjoyed "1906". As a San Francisco native, I felt it really did justice to the culture and history, the cast of truly fantastical  characters, that really did exist in San Francisco. From the Fallons to  Shainghai Kelly, to all the quirky characters in between,  and the vibrant urban wilderness of Portsmouth Square and the Barbary Coast, the story really shines  a carnivalistic, epic light on that time that was the end of the west and  beginning of the modern era. And a time and history that I have always loved and been proud of. I have always felt that there should be more art; books, songs, movies, anything devoted to this monumental part of American history, particularly with unfortunate world disasters and governments' mishandlings of them more prevalent today. And "1906" is a great example of that. People should read it. Thank you for a fun and exciting journey through a spectacular part of our past 
 Having spent most of my life in inner city academic medical institutions, I thought I knew much about the healthcare of the underprivileged.  Having never worked in a truly public hospital, however, it wasn't until I read Opdyke's very readable book comparing a traditional academic, private hospital (New York Hospital) with a public one (Bellvue) that I could understand the real difference between the two.   The book is well-written and easily read. There are sufficient facts to support her premises.  It is a mark the book's worth, that I only lament that the author condensed some time periods that could have been even more detailed.  Still, this is a must read for anyone commited to healthcare, but who has never had the experience of working in a public hospital.  It raises many important issues that must be solved if universal healthcare is ever to become a reality in this country.  Five stars 
 I'm writing to refute a long, angry review I just read of this book. The reviewer points out the evil of following these laws, and is angry that the book advocates them. The book does not advocate these laws, it teaches them. It's a history lesson. It's not Greene's fault that these laws have been effectively put into effect for centuries by powerful people. The book is an analysis of human behavior and social relations, not a book on ethics. If it makes you angry, then it means you are literal-minded, anti-history, live in a dream world, and are completely wrapped up in yourself.  This book teaches you to be attentive to the social atmosphere that you  live in. If you can't do that, then you are anti-social, anti-powerful, anti-seductive, anti-intellectual, and a big  BOZO 
 ...mainly becuase it's so honest. It's filled with useful advice, tips and ways to make a man gain respect for you, the woman. Many times, we women think we have to be nice when it comes to men--and we don't! We have to take control or they end up getting it. Ms. Argov knows this and shows us how.  If you are uncertain about how to hold your own in a relationship, then get this book. It helps with all that and is good, enjoyable reading at the same time. Along with it, I also recommend "Why Men Marry Bitches" and "Man Magnet."  However, don't let this one pass you by! It's worth every cent 
 I was searching for a style to work my first flash project and found this book. This has been a great investment. The minimalism in cartoon its all over TV like Nickelodeon's Danny Phantom, Invader Zim, Disney's Kim Impossible and Mucha Lucha. I wish I had this book earlier when I was in character design class. It's quite interesting, but the cover isn't finished. What happened Hart 
 We have all experienced teachers who inspired, challenged, encouraged their students, who expanded worlds, opened doors, and helped to achieve educational, career, and personal goals. Those Who Can...Teach! is a much  appreciated tribute to the amazing men and women who devoted their lives  (often at great sacrifice to themselves) to educating children of all ages  and backgrounds, who made a difference in the lives of their young charges.  Those Who Can...Teach! also serves as an effective inspiration to those who  aspiring to affect the world for the better by educating the minds of the  next generation, and the next, and the next 
 Even after many years in the business, I found Craig Hall's book Timing the Real Estate Market to be full of useful and valuable industry insight. Obviously real estate, as well as other investment vehicles, is all about timing: evaluating local trends and identifying the stages of each cycle. Anyone, from the most experienced to the novice, can refresh and learn more about the unique real estate trading arena. Craig Hall's years of experience have paid off, and the advice and real life examples from both his successes and challenges can be helpful to anyone seeking knowledge on real estate timing 
 this book brings to light some of the details of biodynamic agriculture in  a readable, witty fashion. thank goodness it is here for us to rea 
 In this entertaining sequel to Gremlins, Billy Peltzer and Kate Beringer have moved to New York where they work for Clamp Enterprises in a high tech office building.  When his owner dies, lovable Gizmo is taken prisoner and held in a Laboratory in the Clamp office building. When Billy finds out, he rescues Gizmo and hides him in a filing cabinet in his cubicle until he can take him home. Of course, it doesn't take long before two of the three rules about Gremlins are broken: Gizmo gets wet and spawns lots of little Gremlins who quickly find a way to eat after Midnight. Soon the Gremlins take over the office building and threaten to take over New York. Once again it's up to Billy, Kate, and Gizmo to stop them.   This is a thoroughly enjoyable sequel. While the original was a dark and at times violent comedy, this is a straight out comedy which spoofs everything from the Wizard of Oz to Rambo to the first Gremlins movie itself. Daniel Clamp, owner of Clamp Enterprises, is a funny takeoff on Donald Trump. The fully automated office building is a hoot and even funnier when the Gremlins wreak havoc with it. There are so many jokes and sight gags in the movie that you can watch it over and over again and still see things that you missed before. Even some of the extras on the DVD are spoofs; the behind the scenes documentary is especially funny.   The actors are all wonderful, especially Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates as Billy and Kate. Dick Miller returns as Mr. Futterman, still shaky with his first encounter with the Gremlins (who actually killed him in the first movie), but willing to fight them. John Glover nails the part of Daniel Clamp. All the actors seem to be having fun in the movie, which makes it even more enjoyable.  Highly recommended. 
 Although this is a stamped blade, it is a very well made knife. Instead of a 'tooth' style serrated blade, it has a scalloped edge. It works beautifully on bread of any kind, cuts right through any crust without crushing the bread. Also cuts cakes cleanly. For bagels it works best if you lay the bagel flat.  I've also used it to carve boneless roasts with good results. It doesn't carve well though for turkeys and chickens (but then it's not designed for that task.  I've had this knife for 2 years and it cuts cleanly every time and supposedly will never need sharpening. Time will tell on that one 
 I can only assume that the handful of people rating this game with one star out of five are GTA fanboys or total curmudgeons. Forget comparisons with GTA. Yes, some of the open-world gameplay elements are familiar. But this is basically a Tony Montana Simulator, and THAT'S the (very considerable) USP of the game. It's all about "What Would Tony Do?" The conversations are hilarious, the gunplay is great, the vehicle physics are solid, the drug wars game adds an extra layer of strategy and some interesting choices. Sure, there are some periods where game events hit a bit of a lull, but most other games (GTA in particular) are guilty of this. And at its best, this game is an absolute blast. Aside from the decent core mechanics, the game will MAKE YOU LAUGH constantly, which is no small consideration; it's consistently entertaining even when you're NOT busy with a mission, and you can't ask for much more than that 
 This book has given me an insight into the world of a dyslexic child or person.  I believe it is invaluable and the most helpful book I have read on the subject to date!!!  Very worthwhile investment for any parent or teacher!  Great tips! Recommendations are excellent and it is so easy to read and understand.  5******A+++++++ 
 I bought his movie because when I was a kid and glued to the TV on rainy summer days this always seemed to be on and I thought it was good. It's not a bad movie, in fact it's kinda charming. I like it now mostly because of the two Stars John Travolta and man oh man Olivia Newton-John is smokin' 
 Genuinely shocking book if you are not up on the literature in this nook and cranny, dark and ominous--coreleonic. Beyond questions of shadow finance lies the sherlockian big one. It is hard to grasp how media manipulation can succeed here. It is a sad exploitation of innocent believers. At least enter the undeground by acquainting yourself with the facts 
 Nasser's attention to detail in Nash's work and his illness brings a more life-like face to his struggle with genius and schizophrenia.  The book spends an extraordinary time explaining game theory and the basis of Nash's theory which ultimately produced his Nobel prize.  Highly recommended 
 The central achievement of Süskind's novella is the way it articulates the social anxiety of a man whose childhood fear of abandonment has played out as a lifetime of limited scope, controlling routines and self-imposed isolation.  That might sound heavy but it isn't - mainly because Süskind wisely chooses the "free indirect" narrative style (mastered by Henry James).  The story is told in the third person, but is nevertheless filtered through Jonathan Noel's gaze and consciousness so that external reality exists only as refracted in his mind.  The result is that we see the world as he sees it, but without the unreliability that such a point of view entails.  Süskind is thereby able to show us precisely what he wants us to see - both the horror and humour of Noel's experience - and to deliver a climax which remains somewhat objective and thereby inspires hope.  Other reviewers seem to have found the ending cloying and unrealistic, but I think they're assuming more than Süskind suggests.  Noel and his life are not utterly transformed at the end - he has an epiphany, he loses his fear, but it may or may not last 
 The Christian Jesus is way off the mark. Yeshua clearly practiced Orthodox Judaism. He never criticised nor corrected Moses. His arguments with others was limited to Halakhah. Where the traditions of the Judaism of his time were in conflict with the Torah (AKA the Law) He provided correction. Where those traditions did not conflict with God's laws, He had little to say and it appears that He honored them. Yeshua upheld every verse of the Torah and the Prophets as he made clear in Matthew 5. He is misunderstood  today (as is Paul) because we are unfamiliar with the culture of his time. But those listening to him did understand. Those today who are interested in understanding the Jesus of the Scriptures will profit by this book as Daniel Lancaster does a masterful job in this volume 
 This book is not comprehensive enough to teach you what you need to know.  There is no substitute for an avalanche course with a real instructor.  However, if  you  have taken a course but haven't used your knowledge as much as you wished you could, and are therefore trying to refresh your memory this is a great book.  Because it's short it's a quick read: you can read it cover to cover to review the details of safety in avalanche terrain.  It's also a useful reference book or intro to use before or during your Avy course 
 This cd is awesome! Some of the best songs were: Cotton Eyed Joe, Jock Jams, and I like it like that. Be sure to check out all the other Jock Jams cds because they also will "pump you up.&quot 
 Once again Jacobsen and Sheehan have outdone themselves writing a book about their love of the game and the great stories that have ensued from the fairways worldwide...  I laughed until I cried and am going to pass the book on to my friends in the dental society (and huge golf fans) in golf course mecca in Central Oregon.. 
 I purchased this in advance of a quick three day trip. We live in the middle of nowhere and I cannot expect someone to come over and feed our cat twice a day. Sasha is a little piggy, and we cannot leave food in any quantity or she will eat until she vomits. Started using it at last nights dinner hour and she was not afraid of it at all. Ate like her normal "gulp it down in a minute". It opened this morning just fine. At one point today I found her sleeping next to it! The only draw back is the timer, you need to set it so it does its thing at the correct interval from the time you set it, and that the first feeding is right there. Cannot have it all at that price. A good item at a reasonable price

It is a great reminder of how much worse a simple situation could turn into without God on your side!   
  One of the best accounts of the Second World War told from the German side, by one of its most brilliant generals. Around 570 pages, easy read, very enjoyable and didactic, and enormously interesting for its analysis.  It covers 3 main campaigns: the campaign of Poland, of France and the war in the East with Russia (chronologically from the fall of '39 to the spring of '44).  It reads better than any textbook on the subject; has some satisfactory maps and photos. Even though at some points it gets technical, because this is a military story, it never becomes a bore. The layman can understand this story perfectly.  This is a personal view from inside of the German Werhmacht. It's interesting to see not only the big picture of events as he presents it, but especially the plans for battle, the meetings with Hitler and his impressions of him, the portrait of his fellow soldiers, the battles from inside, the daily routines that don't come in textbooks. A book worth the price if only for these details of life. It has some humor in it too, despite all the calamities (see pages 149-150 for the description of the chateau of the manufacturer of Cointreau in France). It also has lots of interesting analyses of the war and whatifs. Insights into the characters of important political and military leaders of the time. An excellent evaluation of the geopolitics of those turbulent times available for everyone. I had to underline many pages of this very juicy book. Now I want to read Rommel's diaries.  NB: While reading Gerhard Weinberg's 'A World at Arms', a global history of WWII, I came across this: "Once arrived at the southern front, von Manstein broke with all the other German army and air force generals and believed that it was possible to hold Stalingrad ... Concerned primarily about his reputation as a daring and always successful military commander, both at the time and after the war, he reinforced Hitler's inclination then and faked the relevant portion of his memoirs after the war."  And in the end-notes of the book he adds: "Manstein worked as hard to distort the record on this matter as on his massive involvement in the murder of Jews." Important details to know about the personage in question since he, obviously, let's us see him in another -positive-  light. Which does not diminish, however, the interest of this book. 
 One of those CD's where you throw out lyrical technique and even some dope beats in exchange for some very entertaining rap music.This will probally be the most entertaining album from 2005 besides maybe Majik Most album. He carries it alot better then his last LP which was not really good even with What Happened to that boy on it.Baby has the personna to make some albums and he made a pretty good one here Lyrics  6.5    Production  6.5   Replay  9.5   Entertainment 1 
 I received a maroon one as a gift and have gotten endless complements on it. When I walked into a knitting shop, the owner thought I had made it until she looked closely at it's edge. I wish I could knit one like it! I tried to knit one and couldn't get it to have the resiliency. It becomes a long tube scarf, or a becoming hat-capelet.  It's fluffy yet warm though light, even though it isn't wool. It washes easily.  HIghly recommended 
 This is going to be a different type of review, but, I believe, an honest one. The reason my review is a little dated is because my brother gave me this album on Thursday, November, 16, 2006. He said you've got to listen to this. It's great. Well, I was very hesitant in listening to it. You see, I had written Bob Dylan off back in the early '90's after I had seen him perform on a few shows on TV. I couldn't understand a thing he said, and the melodies sounded like junk. Bob's voice sounded like he had mush in his mouth, and he sounded like he was down in some dungeon. I was totally embarassed for him, and embarassed when old friends of mine approached me after seeing the same performances and riding me about why they could never see what I had seen in Dylan for years.  You see, I was a Bob Dylan fan from the beginning, way back in the Folk days of the sixties. I went through the Electric period when alot of Dylan fanatics turned on him, but I didn't. I went through his Spiritual years, also when many Dylan fans turned away from him and I stuck in there. But, after hearing how bad he was in his performing in the early to mid '90's, even I gave up. Now, my brother lays this "Modern Times" album on me. I put it in my CD player, expecting the mush I had last heard. Remember, I hadn't heard "Time Out Of Mind", or "Love and Theft" at all. When I had heard that he won awards for these two albums my reaction was one of disbelief, and didn't care to give them a try. When "Modern Times" started playing I couldn't believe my ears. This is the old Dylan, sort of. Sure, his voice was more gravelly, but I could understand him, and the band was excellent. A few songs like "Thunder On The Mountain", Spirit On The Water", When The Deal Goes Down", Nettie Moore", The Levee's Gonna Break", and "Ain't Talkin'", were pure Bob Dylan, with a blues twist to them. You know Folk always was just a step away from The Blues, all along. The songs like "Someday Baby" and "Beyond The Horizon"  are basically mainstream country-rock, easy listening, but with Bob Dylan's distinct style. Sinatra could have done "Someday Baby".  For me, Bob Dylan was back! Something I never thought would happen. What a great surprise! I have been wondering for a long while why two of my all-time "Real Country" heroes, Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson, had wanted to tour with Dylan. My gosh, do they want to turn their fans off? And, for what reason.  Well, as I'm sitting here, I can't wait, from what I've heard from other reviewers, to here "Time Out Of Mind" and "Love and Theft". Before hearing "Modern Times" I certainly wasn't going to be crazy enough to waste my money on the other two albums. Now, I am crazy enough to spend my money on the previous two. But, I don't think it's going to be a waste. I can't wait 
 This is the ultimate clinical reference manual. The medical information is surprisingly easy to understand. A must have around the house 
 A Forest Of Time: American Indian Ways Of History by Peter Nabokov (Professor of American Indian Studies and World Arts/Cultures, University of California, Los Angeles) is a college level study of how Native Americans have interpreted and transmitted their own histories in creation stories, folktales, oral histories, and tradition. Individual chapters address a range of subjects from the dynamics of myth versus history, to the value of rituals, and Native American prophecies for the future embedded within tribal culture. A fascinating, engaging dialogue and sourcebook that contributes a unique multicultural perspective on the origin of America and its native peoples, A Forest Of Time is strongly recommended for personal and academic Native American Studies supplemental reading lists and academic reference collections 
 George MacDonald's writings are succinct and open-ended, permitting, even urging, the reader to ask life-changing questions which God, in His grace, never fails to answer.  C. S. Lewis said of MacDonald "I regarded him as my master."  Many of Lewis' written thoughts reflect truths as expressed by George MacDonald 
 In this sophisticated and adroitly handled memoir, Valerie Hemingway details the years she spent with the Hemingway family-traveling with Ernest's entourage in Spain, working as his personal secretary in Cuba, assisting Mary with Ernest's estate after his death, and dealing with the psychological trauma of her marriage to Ernest's estranged son, Gregory.  While the book offers an intimate look at the final years of Hemingway's life that will be of interest to both scholars and Hemingway enthusiasts alike, it is also a finely wrought and intriguing narrative that details the life of a young Irish journalist who by chance found herself enmeshed in the exciting but often disturbing world of the Hemingway family.  From her run-ins with literary and artistic figures in Europe, to her dealings with Fidel Castro in attempts to safely secure the Hemingway estate after Ernest's suicide, Valerie Hemingway observed first hand the last gasps of literary modernism as the culture entered the turbulent politics of the 1960s, and this cultural backdrop sets the stage for Valerie's account of her intellectual awakening.  This book is essential reading not only for those looking for an in-depth look at Ernest Hemingway's final years and the aftermath of his suicide but also for those looking for an engrossing account of the author's captivating life.      
 I used to buy those cheap $[...] red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets, just to have some fun, but the batteries didn't last long enough and the beam wasn't bright at all, not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round.  I bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green.  I thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot, but it is much more than I thought it would be.  The beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day.  The range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers!  I love it!  A much better buy than those crappy red ones, and the AAA batteries are easy to replace and last much longer 
 Ever wondered how a particular language functions? Well, this book is the one to use! It includes grammatical sketches of languages with sizeable amounts of native speakers. Each section generally contains the some of the  following about a language: brief historical background, phonology,  morphology, syntax, and if it's not written in Roman letters, a chart for  that particular alphabet/syllabary. One of the things I particular liked  was giving word-for-word translations then giving a free one.  This gives  me an idea on how languages like German, Japanese, Tagalog, Vietnamese,  etc. form their sentences (like SVO, VSO, SOV).  And also for some  languages, like Polish and Spanish, it lists the allophones for a phoneme.   A word of advice, I highly recommend having at least some knowledge in  linguistic terminology and in IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), since  this book uses them extensively. This is one reference work that you should  definitely have 
 Extremely well researched. McChesney has been a key figure in the "media debate" and he approaches the subject with knowledge and objectivity. His disciplined, almost scientific investigation is an example of non-partisan coverage of a crucial issue. If only a few politicians were as concerned with the public interest as McChesney, we would be in a better world. I am a Mexican citizen so I couldn't care less about U.S. partisan politics, and if you care about the fate of public communications, you shouldn't either. This is a problem that affects every country, not just the U.S.A., since the big telecommunication companies are broadcasting all over the World. The interest of big advertisers is being protected by U.S. policy and their marketing messages are then blasted everywhere. Even the smallest community in the South-Mexican jungles knows Ronald McDonald. CNN has Latin editions of their biased news transmitted to most Latin countries. As an outsider, I hope the U.S. citizenry will realize that this is not an issue of Democrats vs. Republicans but a World-wide issue of the individual vs. the big corporations. In reality they don't care about your political affiliations, as long as you saturate your credit cards to buy their heavily advertised products, you can debate each other to death 
 the book is the best of two worlds It's well written and gives the bare minimum of theory you have to know to jump on the soldering iron without too much fuss about maths Numerous ,practical exemples are given with clear schematics In my opinion this is the very best book you can begin with when dealing with audio tubes amplifier 
 Ondaatje does something wonderful - again, here with Anil's Ghost.  It was difficult to put down.  In Anil's Ghost, one gets a real sense of the searing heat, the dead bodies, the tension of memory, and the liberation of truth.  With rich and full imagery, strong yet somewhat Orientalist language and the penetrating feeling of truth that we have come to know as to know is Ondaatje.  Anil's Ghost takes us to Sri Lanka, a country with a long history and tradition - caught in a twentieth century revolution - this is all fiction, of course, we are told that up front.  Into this chaos returns Anil Tissera, born in Sri Lanka, educated in England and America, takes her training back to Sri Lanka only to meet her memories head on.  Using Sri Lanka as a backdrop, Ondaatje brings his Orientalist prowess to presence for us in this highly evocative and gripping tale.  Anil's Ghost es una historia de amor, de familia de identidad, y enemigo desconocido, de la busceda para encontrar la llave para desifrar el pasado.  Miguel Llor 
 This gives you the how and the why and what you must do to accomplish what you wish to accomplish in your writing.  Worth every penny 
 This is by far the BEST machine ever created for coffee addicts!  Since I got it for christmas I have not been to one coffee shop.  I can make ANY drink that any coffee shop can do and I can make them while I put on my make-up!  This machine is a bit noisy so if you have lite sleepers, beware.  I have mine set up in my bedroom so I can just pop the pods in during my morning routine.  The temperature is perfect, I NEVER burn my mouth, and the taste is out of this world.  They are comming out with new flavors all the time, including decafe for you who need to avoid the cafe-bug!  This is perfect for any life style 
 Bought this product.  It's sensible, helpful and mindful of the time that people don't have for getting into shape.  The only gripes I've got are the UK price, 13.00 plus instead of $13.00 plus dollars and the presentation.  The green, yellow and brown undermine the message on the kit.  Instead of get fit, the presentation is more like a 50s version of how to be a frump in 30 seconds, which most people do effortlessly! Those colours need changing 
 What a great vacuum cleaner. I've only used this once but I'm confident that it will last a long time with proper care. It was pretty easy to assemble with just a few steps. You will need a phillips screwdriver though. I was amazed at how much dirt and animal hair that was sucked up off of the carpeting and rugs. It is a good idea to clean the filter after every use. This is just an all around well built affordable vacuum cleaner. This vacuum cleaner sucks and I mean that in a good way 
 Schaeffer's book was a godsend to me, answering and echoing the questions that rang in my mind when trying to figure out what it really means to be a follower of Christ, and whether or not being one entails leaving reason behind in favor of revelation. This work goes a long way in answering the questions of HOW I know what I know; and exposing presuppositions about the nature of the universe that shape our thinking. It prepared me for many onslaughts against a reasonable faith, showing that there is another way other than accepting either the dissolution of absolute truth in postmodernism or the anti-reason/anti intellectualism of certain branches in fundamentalism. This is an excellent help to anyone experiencing a personal paradigm shift in Jesus' direction, or as a primer to exploring and examining competing worldviews. 
 This is a wonderful collection of an amazing series.  Bendis is at his best in this series and Oeming's art is excellent.  The only reason this collection didn't get 5 stars is because of the binding.  Because it is hardcover some of the art and word balloons are cut off.  It wasn't that big of a deal for me because I have read these issues previously but if you haven't you run the risk of breaking the binding when you try to open the book up to see the complete pages.  Still well worth the price 
 While the Nursery Crime series is not as good as the Thursday Next series, it is still an excellent series. The Fourth Bear is one of those book CDs, you sit in the car a little longer then you need to so you can hear more. I just wish they would keep the same reader from book to book. 
 Frank Partnoy W.W. Norton & Company, Inc. ISBN 0-393-04622-2 F.I.A.S.C.O.-Blood In The Water On Wall Street Reviewer: Shelly Waxman for Bookpleasures.com  The title is a play on words or in this case, a play on letters. F.I.A.S.C.O. really are initials that represent: "Fixed Income Annual Sporting Clays Outing." It is a poor theme on which to base the book. It's an affair held by Morgan Stanley Investment Company ("MS"). The title is a little too cute. It would have been better to just call it FIASCO without any periods. This is because the book is an insider's tell all memoir revelation of some of the enormous monetary losses suffered during the 1990's from misguided betting in the derivatives market.  Much of the book involves the author's attempt to simplify the definitions of the various products he dealt with while an employee at MS selling derivatives. It is difficult to simplify "investments" that the author admits were largely not understood by the sellers or the buyers.  The best simplification he provides is that it is a bet that a financial instrument will go up or down-an option in that sense-although much more complicated. The option itself is bought and sold and it value is derived from the performance of another financial instrument or a package of instruments. It is inherently complicated stuff.  However, the fiasco part of it is a sampling of stupidity, fraud, theft and graft. Losses of billions of dollars by outfits such as Orange County California, ended with the losses repaid by the public-of course. One instance-which blew me away-was the story of the bankruptcy of Barren Bank-the Queen of England's bank that had existed for hundreds of years.  As a result of the bank's collapse, there occurred a general financial collapse in Japanese banks, markets, and currency. In order to cover their losses for the upcoming financial reporting season, MS created a financial instrument that allowed the Japanese to take large quick profits immediately while deferring the losses to a time of their choice in the future. While doing this and making a large fee on the sale, MS reaped a benefit not revealed to the Japanese of an additional $75 M.  This book debunks the whole field of financial "investments"-derivatives or otherwise. It was published in 1997 but is as current today as it was then. If you can get past the difficult technical explanations, you come to a point where you applaud the author for leaving this wasteland, although to the law, which is another wasteland filled with graft, greed and corruption. But the author states that he is happier being a lawyer. Perhaps when he learns the insides of the law, we may get another revealing insider's look. I already wrote mine-"In the Teeth of The Wind."  If the book is republished, it would be helpful to include an Index.  
 I watched this with total absorption at the plight of this unusual man, the Hurricane.  His story, as others outlined in reviews here, is very sad and unjust:  accused of a crime he didn't commit by a racist cop with an odd hatred of him, he is thrown in prison at the height of his career.    I thought that Denzel Washington was absolutely brilliant, bringing an entire environment and life story with him in each scene as only great actors can do.  He is perhaps the greatest actor in America today.  This performance is one of his best - you sense his internal struggle to survive, with little of it stated directly.  And he grows throughout the film, from a battered youth into a hyper-disciplined athlete, and then as an inmate seeking deeper meaning in life.  It is truly amazing how well he pulls this off.  Then there is the youth who contacts him, a boy from a similar background who is given a chance by a remarkable and unorthodox household.  For some reason, the Hurricane responds to him after ignoring many others, and these two - as well as his foster parents - embark on their own journey of discovery.  As the youth matures, he learns about the political system and feels empowered to change things. That is a profoundly healthy of the American political system.  Eventually, they do change things, which is also a big step of trust and engagement for the Hurricane.  It is really beautiful and uplifting, deeply moving as I identified with both characters.  I now want to learn about the protagonists, perhaps in biographies.  The story goes to the heart of an America in transition, when I grew up.  I do not know enough to answer the critiques about his character by other reviewers.  While I think that more details should have been included in the film, the drama is taut and well told in my view.  It is a completely successful film experience and I am sure I will introduce this to my children when they are ready to learn about race in America.  FOrtunately, the racial tensions are infinitely less acute than when I grew up, so much of this will be historical for them.  Warmly recommended 
 Having a roomie from Cambodia - I had him take a review of the book/CD's.  He was quite impressed.   Now I just need to use it for the basics.  Give it a shot 
 This album features the awesome and powerful vocals of Ian MacKaye, one of the 11 greatest punk "singers" of all time.   Who are the other ten? Hmmm, let's see....Johnny Rotten (Sex Pistols), Joey Ramone (Ramones), Joe Strummer (Clash), Pete Shelley (Buzzcocks), Patti Smith, Jello Biafra (Dead Kennedys), Glenn Danzig (Misfits), Henry Rollins (Black Flag), Milo Aukerman (Descendents), H.R. (Bad Brains).  After leaving the legendary hardcore band Minor Threat, and before forming legendary emo band Fugazi, MacKaye released this fantastic album as part of the short-lived band Embrace.  If you've ever heard Ian sing, and you like what you heard, then chances are you will love this album. It's one of the finest emo records ever, recorded at the very dawn of that much-maligned genre. In the end, it's punk, but a musically and emotionally evolved punk.   The music is hard-charging, but not boring, simplistic or monolithic. And Ian outdoes himself from start to finish, singing with a bracing passion that has very few rivals in the annals of recorded music.  Here's a quote that sums it up: "Ian takes a collection of good-to-great (not to mention surprisingly diverse and dynamic) 2-minute songs and makes them SOAR into the heavens of arm-stretching Godliness." - Mark Prindle  It's a crime that this album is not better-known to fans of rock and punk 
 I recently developed a great interest in cooking, but didn't know what to get, what the differences betweenproducts were, what to use with what, etc. I cook for my boyfriend and myself every night and try to make different and exciting dishes, but in order to do that, you need to know specifics and understand some basics. That is what this book gives. I've always searched for a cookbook that I could read through easily without constantly having to checking other parts of the book for clarification. I've only gone through the first chapter "Kitchen Equipment & Utensils," but it's amazing how much knowledge I've already learned. I used to go into stores like Sur La Table because I always loved cooking equipment, but I never understood what the many utensils were meant to do. This book has helped me with a lot of basics -  like what the differences are between cast-iron skillets, sauce pans, copper pans, etc. Also, she gives you tips throughtoutthe book - how to season the skillet, maintain your wooden cutting board, and much more. They're things you would normally learn from your mother. For someone who is just getting into cooking, she provides her favorite labels on things from types of equipment to brands of olive oil. I just got the book yesterday and haven't been able to put it down. Also, last night I made one of her recipes, Tuna Tartare. It was REALLY great! I've always ordered it in restaurants, but never tried to make it at home. My boyfriend was saying how he was full and couldn't really eat much. He finished his ENTIRE portion! Great stuff! The ingredients most recipes call for are things you will definitely be able to find at a local fine food/health store. I definitely recommend anyone just getting into cooking to get this book. Easy reading and easy to understand 
 When I happened upon this book in my favorite local bookstore (sorry, amazon!), it was a revelation!  It laid out, page after page after page, the rationale for design and layout, with accompanying illustrations of the principles discussed.  What was so welcome in this book was the clear, succinct, take-nothing-for-granted approach.  Everything is explained and illustrated.  As an introduction to page and publication desgin and layout, it is a marvel.  Knowing the author's background and "credentials" added extra assurance to my reading.  Some of the observations in this book may be limited to print media.  Web designers, for example, will want to consider additional sources (such as "Don't Make Me Think").  However, what both print and web design have in common is found here: the rhyme and reason for headlines, how we "scan," how we read things in our Western culture (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), appropriate juxtapositon of explanatory text with pictures/graphics, and more.    I can see why this book has been a standard reference in its field for years 
 Col. Nick Rowe's resovle to resist Marxist-Leninist indoctrination from the brutish revolutionaries that held him captive wavered many times. Yet, he never gave in. Taken captive in 1963 by VC guerillas, Rowe was held for five years in the dark emerald confines of the U Minh forest. The chief ploy that helped Rowe survive, his cover story that he was an engineer and knew nothing of military value, was blown away when leftist college students in the States betrayed US POWs by collecting information on them and informing Hanoi about their military backgrounds. (It is sobering to note that the types of individuals that delivered up their own countrymen into the hands of evil now occupy chairs in elite universities, where Marxism is the order of the day). Angered by this deception, the VC planned to hand Rowe over to the Enemy and Civilian Proselyting Section at Zone, where the decision of his living or dying could be made. The order was tantamount to a death sentence if Rowe didn't write and sign a confession. Thanks to good fortune and incredible force of will, Rowe managed to escape in his fifth year of captivity. Tragically, this American hero was gunned down in the Philippines in 1989 by communist insurgents there, betrayed this time by his own government, which knew of the danger Rowe was in but did nothing to get him out of harm's way. Five Years to Freedom is a long and detailed description of Rowe's environment, his captives, and his psychological and physical condition throughout five torturous years of captivity. Written only three years after his release, Rowe's story conjures image after image of hot, humid jungle, relentless monsoon, disease, brutality, filth, and deprivation. The triumph of Rowe's spirit is its saving grace. You won't regret buying it 
 the book has everything you would want to know about hoffman and other famous bodybuilders, strongmen but the way the book was written too much information, was not entertaining 
 This is a story of strength and survival suited not only for adults but for young teens as well.  Great reading!  One of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read them all 
 It all starts out with someone I really would call a "Not so Jolly Roger."  They have pistols, daggars and lots of cool weapons in this book. (Violent). Something always goes wrong-wich always happens in books-of course.  Get this book or I'll be "The not so Jolly Roger. 
 This is a story that is as fresh today as it was when it was orginally written.   It encourages make believe, yet allows for a feeling of security through the need for others 
 The aliens have landed and they bring incredible news.  The five extinction events in Earth's history also occurred on two other planets at the very same time.  The aliens already feel that any scientifically minded person must believe in god the creator because science proves the creator must exist.  This comes as a surprise to main character and paleontologist Tom Jericho.  He has always felt that science does not prove god exists and nothing short of a smoking gun will change his mind.  But Tom gets to work with one of the visiting aliens and is exposed to countless scientific proofs that god must exist.  But even though Tom has an incurable disease he still cannot bring himself to believe in a creator.  Toms's work with the alien shows the reader some of the incredibly improbable coincidences necessary for life to exist.  The presence of the aliens also has an effect on political and religious groups and bodies.  Some of these are followed in greater details while others are almost anecdotal.  Sawyer is no stranger to dealing with rally big concepts and he really holds his own in this one.  I have always felt that science leaves plenty of room for god and certainly does not disprove the concept so I was especially pleased by the premise.  I did feel that the book was a little preachy about health care.  I cannot believe that every Canadian's first thought in any health care situation is to compare options with American health care.  But other than that I found the book to be an excellent read.  Check it out 
 I loved the original Roadhouse and did not think a sequel could keep my interest, but was I wrong!  Johnathon Schaech really does Patrick Swayze justice!  He was very believable as Dalton's son and was awesome in the fight scenes!  This sequel was very entertaining and great fight scenes.  Johnathon is sexy and has my vote!  Summer sizzles with this DVD 
 This book makes a good reference book for herbalists and people interested in botanicals. Divided into herb sections, the author bases the information on scientific research rather than folk lore which sometimes verifies the the long standing beliefs about particular herbs 
 I'm sure a lot of you know Andy Chase from Ivy.  Could there be a more stellar band?  Well, I guess there is now because I really feel like Andy topped himself with this release.  I haven't heard much from Ivy lately (even though they're reissuing their back catalog!) so I was wondering what Andy Chase was up to.  This album is such a romantic sounding record, that I can't help but put it on over and over in the nighttime hours.  It's sonically richer than most of the stuff Ivy ever did but when you're chief songwriter as distanct as Andy is then you'll tend to sometimes tread the same ground in certain ways.  There are occasional tracks such as "Justine" and "Beautiful View" that really, really remind me of Ivy.  When all is said and done, what you have hear is a near-perfect nugget of pop greatness.  RECOMMENDED FOR ALL IVY AND FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE FANS 
 There is a theory that scientific geniuses have to be alone, (Einstein, Newton, Archimedes needed peace and quiet to distill their thoughts) but literary masters need company. Shakespeare and Marlowe thrived in the boiling pot of Elizabethan London; Dickens, Thackeray and Trollope all went to the same clubs; and in this wonderful book we find some of the most innovative and arresting intellects of the twentieth century living in the same house. This is a story that most of us don't know about, but anyone interested in books will love. Funny, entertaining, superbly researched and compassionate, it even made me feel sympathy for Auden, Isherwood, Britten who famously went the wrong way across the Atlantic when war was declared. The test of a great book is, does it leave you wanting more, and this one does. Burroughs house in Tangier? Gertrude Stein's salon? I dont know if Ms. Tippins is interested in a sequel, but I sure am. 
 I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed the Wisdom tales(I may have accidently called the Wisdom tales Wonder tales)again, having seen Ms. Forest perform live was a great pleasure. I enjoyed all the helps provided as to how these stories were found. I hope to use these resources in my own  further research. I recommend all of Ms. Forest's tapes and books for  enjoyable reading and listening to teachers, parents and children. Let your  imagination go and you will discover the joy of story! A great effort 
 I BOUGHT THIS AND MY WIFE'S SUGGESTION BECAUSE I WATCH IT WHEN IT COMES ON TV EVERY TIME.  SHE SUGGEST I BUY IT AND WATCH IT ON MY OWN TIME SO NOT TO TIE UP THE TV IN THE LIVING ROOM WHEN SHE HAD RATHER US WATCH SOMETHING WE SHARE MORE IN COMMON. WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA FOR BOTH OF US 
 The hospital where I plan to deliver gives this book out free to its patients, which says a lot. This book is very, very thorough. It barely skips a thing.  However, it's very dry and clinical - like a textbook. I found it very taxing to read; it just did not hold my interest. It's organized like a textbook, meaning the chapter transitions are a bit jarring for a newly pregnant woman who perhaps is looking for a more timeline-based presentation. The photoillustrations are dark and look like snapshots rather than professional photography, which means they're often useless.  I went back and forth over giving this book three or four stars and finally decided on four with the caveat that it is best used a pure reference. For an equally info-packed pregnancy book that is more enjoyable to read, I recommend Ann Douglas' "The Mother of All Pregnancy Books. 
 I am very pleased with this purchase and the timely delivery. Linda Munt 
 Even though it did not have lots and lots of facts, the pictures make this book well worth buying 
 Seven years old Jordan March and her thirteen years old brother Ian are being raised by a loving nurturing mother, Carol, and Christopher, a useless cheating father whose only love is alcohol.  Carol is always there for her offspring while Christopher has nothing to do with either of them.  When Carol notices Jordan has tiny breasts and pubic hairs, she panics and tells her daughter not to say a word to anyone and to never let Grandma Emma see her naked.  Carol also checks her daughter's dirty laundry only to find evidence that the little girl menstruated.  Brilliant science minded Ian is fascinated by it and decides he must study what is happening to his sister.  Due to his drinking and driving Carol and Christopher are severely injured in a car accident that leaves both incapable of caring for themselves let alone two children.  Grandma Emma who detests her son takes over caring for her two grandchildren though much of the daily chores are left to the hired help, strict disciplinarian Miss Harper.  Emma does not hide the fact that she cherishes Jordan, but seems at best to be indifferent to Ian, perhaps loathing him whereas Miss Harper thinks the seemingly sweet girl hides an evil soul.  This is the summer that will make or break young Jordan especially after she and Ian meet Flora, who reveals secrets involving the March brood.  As always with any of the "Flower" novels, the villain is never quite who you think he or she is.  The story line focuses on Jordan whom readers will empathize with while also feeling horrified that a second grader is beginning to turn into a woman.  Fans hope she comes out of this okay as it seems those who should love and nurture her want to use her.  Even though the author died, fans of the series will appreciate a fine entry that easily could have been written by V.C. Andrews' ghost.  Harriet Klausner 
 Let me just preface my review by saying, "Thank GOD, I didn't live back then!" The story is told by Gilbert Markham through a series of letters to his friend Halford and by journal entries of the mysterious and devout Mrs. Helen Graham. A recent widow, Mrs. Graham and her young son are the new tenants of Wildfell Hall, a dilapidated estate owned by Frederick Laurence. The air of mystery that surrounds Mrs. Graham is certainly fodder for the townsfolk. She is quiet, reserved and not very inviting to most of her neighbors. Wildfell Hall only has a few rooms that are in livable condition. And she has a strange attachment to her son, Arthur. She is never separated from him.  As the days go by, Gilbert finds that he is undeniably attracted to Mrs. Graham. But he is very disheartened to find that rumors are now being circulated around town about Mrs. Graham and Frederick, a man that Gilbert has always considered a friend. It is also very clear to him that Helen is shutting him down at ever effort to get to know her, especially regarding her past.  Eventually, Helen is unable to deny her feelings for Gilbert and gives him her diary. This action is her one chance for him to understand who she really is and dispel the rumors that the townsfolk have come to believe. The diary is Helen's account of her life before she moved into the rooms at Wildfell Hall, but most specifically, it is about her marriage to Arthur Huntingdon, a very charming man that had few, if any, scruples.  At first I had a hard time getting into this book. I found the characters all rather unlikable and rather annoying. The townsfolk were always in everyone's business. Gilbert was rather insensitive and kind of bully, when you come right down to it. And Helen spent most of the book playing a martyr by saying it was "God's Will". I do realize that it was different times, and a woman's rights were very few. This is the main reason I overlooked my annoyance and continued reading. In the end, I found that I really enjoyed the story. Bronte wrote this book at a time when women were less than citizens and brought forth a whole host of probably very controversial topics for that time: alcoholism, infidelity, and women's rights to name just a few. I think Anne Bronte was very much ahead of her time 
 I took this book to Hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice.  I loved the relationship between the two main characters.  I felt like the ending may have been a little rushed, maybe because I did not want it to end! Also, I felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story. Matthew Lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book.  Other than that I loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars 
 It happened as if by accident.  I was fourteen years old, spending a Saturday window shopping in downtown Kent with my best friend, when we came upon a sidewalk sale outside a bookstore.  An avid reader, I began to peruse one of the myriad cardboard boxes, when a picture of a young girl's saddle shoe clad legs suddenly caught my eye.  I was intrigued from the first glance, but it was the title that inspired me to grab it from the stack and slap five dollars on the counter. The book was Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov. 	Reading Lolita was the first time I found myself enthralled by language and the power of using just the right word to make the reader bond with a character, loathe him, or a mixture of both.  The characters are what make this book so compelling, as each of the four major players are so multifaceted that every time I read the book, I finish with a different understanding of whom I sympathize with and whom I can't stand.  Humbert, Lolita, her mother, Charlotte, and Quilty, the man she eventually uses as her escape from her and Humbert's affair, are inherently unlikable and the story itself is so disturbing that it is understandable why the book was banned in the United States when first published.   Still, there is something about Humbert's doomed obsession and unrequited childhood desires that cause the reader to align with him from beginning to end.  Nabokov's intricate writing style forces me to question the characters' moral ambiguities each time I read it; despite its controversial subject matter, he is able to give such depth to his characters that a just cause can be seen for each of their actions, even a relationship between a twelve year old girl and a middle aged man who commits murder as an act of vengeance on his lost love. 	Thematically, one of Lolita's strengths is Nabokov's use of the book's central relationship as a symbol of postmodern culture.  Written in 1954, in the midst of the decade's postwar prosperity, the book has been viewed as being not just a story of a love affair between a young girl and a much older man, but an illustration of the merging cultures of old world Europe and the rise of American materialism and decadence.  Interpretations such as this historical/cultural view go beyond the book's negative connotation, perhaps causing readers to see in the dynamics of Humbert and Lolita's relationship an illustration of human relationships that otherwise may have gone unnoticed.  Above all, it is Lolita's statement of the consequences of desire pursued too vigorously and too far that, combined with its remarkable characters, makes it a classic fifty years after its inception. 
 Mr. Sleet was a very special person whose very life defined the term humanitarian.  He always had time to listen, and no matter how busy, he was there to help and encourage.   He wanted people to know what it meant to be  black in America.  Many thousands of untitled black folks walked   undaunted, hand-and-hand with pain & triumph in the civil rights  movement.  Mr. Sleet was on the front lines to capture those special and  poignant moments.   He was  "on the right side" to help us reach  for higher ideals....the ideals of justice, perserverance, peace,  humaneness, forgiveness and understanding. I am privleged to have known Mr.  Sleet and to have been friends with his son, Gregory when we were at  Hampton University.  Indeed, Gregory who is a federal judge and who we now  proudly call Judge Sleet  continues to represent his father's ideals.  Moneta Sleet's work reminds us every day to listen, to care and to share.   I hope that everyone will buy this book and more importantly share its work  and meaning with all children. Lynnette C.

 I have a complete set of the Little Colonel books that my mother accumulated for me over a period of years in the 1940's, when they were already long out of print. A classic Shirley Temple movie of the late 1930's (I think) was based on the first book, but I enjoyed the later ones even more. I am delighted to see them reissued after all these years. Lloyd Sherman and the other characters introduced in the later books (The Little Colonel's House Party and succeeding titles) were almost as real to me, when I was 8 to 12 years old, as my own friends. My favorite character was not Lloyd herself, who seemed overprivileged and a little too perfect, but Elizabeth Lloyd Lewis (Betty), the daughter of one of Lloyd's mother's girlhood friends. The stories also provide fascinating insights into post-Civil War Southern society 
 It came quickly, 6 days with Amazon's free shipping. It came today and within 10 mins all my knifes were very sharp. I then gave my new OXO 6.5 knife (I ordered this with the hone) a few passes over my sharping stone then 10 light passes on the hone "WOW" I can shave with this now.   I like the handles/grips on all of my OXO products.  Very pleased. Well worth the price (14.95 
 A good swashbuckling novel is indispensable.  Fencing, fighting, swimming across moats, humor, true love, red hair... and of course, there's a sad ending, so we've got all the essential elements of good literature here.  
 HT has written a valuable and imminently readable history. The pace is quick for the most part but deliberate when necessary. His diction is not that of Prescott's but carefully chosen to captivate the reader nonetheless. It makes good reading.  HT also presents a good story. For example, I know La Noche Triste is coming; you know its coming. But HT builds up the suspense effectively and then unleashes the battle upon us in a pitched and dynamic portrayal of tenacity, courage, and elan.  Notwithstanding the errors alleged by other reviewers, I found Conquest to be immensely enjoyable. For both the novice and scholar interested in ancient Mexico, this is a wonderful epic and exhilirating read 
 We just returned from our trip to Madrid and this book was fantastic.  My sister is abroad there and my family members have all gotten different guides for their visits, but I have now loaned out both copies I had of this guide, because they found it to be much better than theirs.  It has great breakdowns of the areas of Madrid and maps that are all cross-referenced.  It also includes a section on Toledo that we found to be very helpful on our day trip there.  We were very pleased with this purchase 
 Krich hits her best stride ever in dissecting the intricate relationships that exist between teacher and student, mentor and protege, and lovesick, confused teens. Molly Blume comes through again as her imperfect, human self gets personally involved in helping a HS senior save herself from a series of bad decisions.  The Orthodox Jewish world should take extra note of this important book that analyzes, albiet fictionally, the challenges facing the majority of teens today, in varying levels and consequences. There is also a veiled indictment of the tunnel vision that exists among many adults and educators that "its not happening in my backyard".   Kudos to Rochelle for taking on a difficult topic with grace, and with a great plot twist at the end.  
 Surely one of Isherwoods finest works. This memoir tells of his time in Hollywood during World War II and of his meeting and subsiquent association with Swami Prabhavananada. Isherwood approaches the subject with candid  reflection and in his usual minimal style takes the reader on a a spiritual  quest for the truth behind god and the trail of the pacifists dilemma  during a crippling war. Auden, Huxley and a host of others walk through the  work. An absolute must for Isherwood fans. I cried at the end...one of the  best books I've ever read 
 As a dedicated Yorkist and a member of the Richard III Society, I am constantly reading any work I can find about the Duke of Gloucester.  This book is a murder mystery that takes place at a weekend gathering of Ricardians in England.  Accidents begin to happen that echo Shakespeare's telling of Richard's alleged murders.  Each of the Ricardians in the novel plays a role from the Yorkist period ... one accident has the fellow playing George, Duke of Clarence, bound and stuffed into a barrel (to echo the alleged drowning of the unfortunate Duke in a butt of malmsey).  The reading is light and entertaining, and replete with well researched historical information.  It's on my Listmania "Ricardian Reader's Library" as a result 
 I really enjoy this cd. It has some amazing songs with some amazing lyrics in them. But I do have to be honest. Human Tornado and Then Again could drop off the face of the earth. I'm sorry to Anthony and all those who like that song, but I... well the songs don't appeal to me. But I still love Anthony's work and stuff, and can't wait to hear more 
 As I read this book, I thought to myself, "This book is a combination of Watership Down, Harry Potter, and Wind in the Willows!" While it is true that this book shares the best of the attributes of those favorites, it is unique in its unfolding of the destiny of Rannoch, a red deer born to fulfill a prophecy. The story just got better and better as the narrative unfolded. Every turn was pleasing, even when sorrowful things came to pass. I laughed and cried by turns. Textured, yet simple -- but not simplistic; touching, sincere, and somehow familiar; entertaining and moving; real and uncomplicated, yet thought-provoking -- and very refreshing . . . these phrases capture some of the attributes of Clement-Davies's first novel. Virtues of loyalty, justice, and friendship interweave with echoes of ancient truths. I wouldn't have missed it for anything and will recommend it to others 
 As a professional aerospace engineer, I am often disappointed by books and articles written for amateurs and hobbyists. This book is a rare exception in that it is accurate, understandable and well laid out. The very low Reynolds number conditions that model aircraft fly in are sufficiently different from full scale that most engineers don't really understand what is going on. This book led me through unfamiliar territory and gave me a much fuller appreciation for the aerodynamics I encountered in very-high-altitude and planetary flight 
 Very entertaing book.  Anyone with a love for science and Star trk will enjoy this book. Highly recommende 
 get this one! I was forced into watching it by my girlfirend but after only maybe 10-15 minutes I was really interested in seeing what happened next. I have been forced to watch a few other romance films in my time and this one I actually enjoyed. If your girl has given you a list of romance movies she wants for gifts and you know your going to end up having to watch them with her, do yourself a favor and get this 
 i got two of these for my boys, who are 4 and 3 years of age.  it's awesome man..especially for bedtime...because they're not afraid of the dark...they have flashlight wars on the ceiling...no batteries...big plus  !   it's just awesome....get one you'll love it ! 
 I have mixed feelings about Nora Roberts (aka J.D. Robb) books, mainly because of the rough language in them. But she writes so well and her stories are so engrossing that I find it hard not to pick one up and read once in a while.   In this book Eve Dallas is still coming to terms with her marriage, when a series of murders are committed...all of which involved Irishmen that her husband knew at one time or another. She needs to find out why he knew these men and what connection he had to them in order to find out why this serial murderer is killing and why he is using the MO that he is. Eve comes to understand that her husband is at risk because of his bringing to justice several men who had horrendously hurt the young daughter of Summerset, Roarke's 'valet' and man-of-all-trades.  These books go fast and furious much like the movie of that name. Makes me wonder why no one has ever tried to bring these books to the screen, except too often they botch the book up in screenwriting.   Dallas solves the crimes at great risk to herself and to the others around her. She has to tred a fine line between the law and her husband's old world, so as to not involve him.  Karen Sadle 
 All the recipes in this unique, kid friendly cookbook are done two times, once in words for adult helpers and once in fun pictures for kids, so they can "read" the recipes themselves.  I gave this to Adam, 4 years old, and he loves the recipes!  He also loves just sitting down and "reading" the recipes which he can do since they are all in pictures.  And the illustrations are great.    The receipes are healthy and kid approved. They were developled by Molly Katzen and a pre-school teacher who cooks with her class alot.  So recipes can be done at home or in school.  It also teaches kids about healthy eating, whole foods and making eating and cooking fun.  
 "Garden of Dreams" is one of the loveliest books about women, friendship and family that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Jill and Caye will stay in your heart long after the last page is turned 
 I've always been a fan of the Zombie. It's just a great tropical drink. When I decided that I had had enough of paying $7 for them at restaurants, and that I wanted my own at home, I looked up Trader Vic's recipe. It was okay, but it really was geared more for a sort of "Zombie Punch" -- where ratios were expressed in fifths (entire bottles) rather than ounces.  Later, I happend upon Suzanne Matczuk's Cocktail-o-Matic, which had a much more approachable recipe for Zombies. I began to make those, and was happy.  However, this year I spent two weeks on O'ahu. I became totally hooked on the atmosphere (one could say the entire island made a left turn at 1968, and has just sort of "lived tiki" since), the people, and the drinks and cuisine. So while I was in Hilo Hatties, I picked this book up on a whim.  I was totally impressed. Where I thought I would be getting a book full of touristy BS, I got a book with authentic (one of the authors is Donn's widow, these recipes were taken from his belongings) recipes for both drinks and food.  The drinks are quite palatable. Many of them (such as Beachcomber's Gold and Rum Barrel) are just classic. A couple are "out there" (such as Test Pilot), but you can really taste and feel what the author was going for. I feel I must mention the Zombie recipe from this book. Not only is it authentic -- the man invented the drink -- but we learn that it contained Absinthe! Also, that it was prepared at least a couple times with added glycerine. Wow. This explains the drink's somewhat evil reputation.  If all you got in this book was the drinks, it would be worth the price. However, you gain priceless insight into the culture, and into Donn himself. Of particular interest was the conversation between Donn and Vic about the Mai Tai. Additionally, the story of his shipping gardenias from hawaii (daily!) and his experience in the Army during WWII.  Highly recommended. I'd also recommend the Suzanne Matczuk book, as it is told in the same way (plenty of culture with the drinks), and it is instructional to see the difference in the drinks as she writes them, and the way they were originally... "prescribed. 
 This little book is really what you will need when you're in Italy, you will find everything in it easy & highly organized for fast reviewin 
 Doing the job but not user friendly.  Plan to spend a lot of time studying the manual, which is poorly written.  
 I HAVE READ A LOT OF BOOKS, BUT I HAVE NEVER READ ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. I WAS HOOK FROM THE FIRST BOOK INVISIBLE LIFE. IF YOU HAVE NEVER READ E. LYNN HARRIS I SUGGEST YOU GIVE HIM A READ. I LOVE THE WAY HE LEAVE THE READER WON'TING MORE HE TAKE YOU INTO THE WORLD AND LIFES OF EACH AND EVERY PERSON IN THE BOOK.

THIS MAN CAN TELL A STORY I DON'T CARE WHAT WALK OF LIFE YOU ARE FROM THERE IS SOMETHING OR SOMEONE IN HIS BOOKS THAT YOU CAN RELATE TO  AS LONG AS HE KEEP WRITING I WILL KEEP READING. I LOVE A INTERESTING STORY WITH A VERY GOOD PLOT. SO DO YOUR THING BOY 
 This book of narrative poetry is divided into four sections.  Most notable in this collection is Levine's presupposing his readers.  In the first poem, the speaker asks, "Can you imagine the air filled with-smoke?/ It was."  The first ten lines of Salt and Oil really sum-up how Levine skillfully envisions his audience.  In this piece, three men are introduced, the narrator calls one Salt and the other Oil.  Levine withholds naming the third man and writes:  "'The third man,' you ask, `who was the third man in the photograph?'  There is no/ photograph, no mystery./ Only Salt and Oil..."  He uses this device in many other poems, and uses it very effectively.  Again, in Cesare, Levine manipulates the reader by painting a portrait of this friend, Cesare and then Levine shocks the reader with, "of course I never knew any Cesare..."  And in case the reader skimmed over that, he rephrases it in the next line, "he died before I left Detroit, before/ I had a chance..." And if the reader is still confused/incredulous, Levine says it once more, "I'm really talking/ about someone else I can't name..."  Strangely enough, as the reader, I wasn't off-put by this - Levine had such a gentle, trustworthy voice that I was willing to follow.  How interesting:  his persuasiveness and my willingness!  Levine's an alert man who listens, waits, and writes-of it.  These pieces have vivid, concrete language but, unfortunately, with little imagery.  In the poem The Sea We Read About, the reader finds the metaphysical, symbolic, and allegorical.   I was carried by lines like, "...the sea spread out, limitless and changing/ everything, and that I would get there some day."  Oh, that elusive "there," that long-away "some day."  In poems like these, Levine speaks to the collective psyche.    Levine has some lovely moments and surprising, poetic diction, like this from Caught a Glimpse:  "The moment is so full/ I have to close my eyes..."  And from the poem, Night Words, "...snow gathers/ on their shoulders and scalds their ungloved hands."  He touches on an intriguing concept here:  let's dream today of our literal future as if we're self-soothsayers while we dream.  Also in The Dead there's a particularly wonderful image:  "he scurried off, the oranges/ tumbling out of the dark sack, one/ after another, a short bright trail/ left on the sidewalk..."  Another beautiful moment can be found in the last two stanzas of The Evening, this idea of "...leafing through the great book of days."  I won't call Levine a man of great poetics, but I will refer to him as a man with poetics of great meaning.    However, I have two qualms with this book.  In many of Levine's poems, he tends to end with the expository; a lot of these stanzas just feel like summations and don't necessarily push the theme (e.g. The Unknowable, Philosophy Lesson, The Mercy).  Secondly, Levine has a consistent form he uses throughout:  a single stanza, longish line poem which usually runs a full page.  This form was fine for most of the pieces.  But what about the poems which beg a shorter line and shorter length?  For example, He Would Never Use One Word Where None Would Do seems to contradict itself in its context, as compared to its form.  Form usually follows function for maximum impact (unless, of course, there's tension in the way form is used in a contrary fashion).  Specifically, this poem expands on the uselessness of over-talk; it's a poem about silence but without much silence itself.  I would expect a poem on wordiness to be less wordy.  One thing that Levine does do right in this poem is introducing this lovely, curious metaphor: "Fact is silence is the perfect water..." 
 [...] unlike other books I've previewed, I got hooked on this one before I even finished the first page. The concepts of trading up, trading down, and the thrill of the hunt so aptly described just about everyone I know. My teen-age daughter's friends have two pairs of sweat pants that they wear over and over until they fall apart. But they all have Coach handbags and IPODs and every accessory. This book is fascinating from the psychologicaly as well as business aspects. As a Human Resources professional, It has helped me look at my employees as customers who also trade up and down, but in terms of salary and benefits, not silk scarves and cheap paper towels 
 This is a great product, especially for starting a dinner party or a  cheese & wine gathering.  The recessed well has plenty of room for  crackers or fruit, & the slicer slices cheese smoothly &  efficiently.  Plus, when the evening is over, you only have to wash one  item 
 These are a very good quality set of socks and the web site I used to ship them was on time and fantistic 
 TJ:  I bought this CD only seeing the band advertised in a magazine article! Well, i'm glad i did buy it because every song on this CD is beautiful and the lyrics are amazing! i highly recommend this!!  **Best Track is :#10 - Coming Down!!! love it 
 I was a big fan of the Clash as a kid in the early 80s, but kind of forgot about them as my tastes grew and became more diverse.  Then for the hell of it I bought this CD about a year ago, and I haven't stopped listening to it.  It is truly a masterpiece, especially if you consider the era when it was recorded.  Buy one for yourself and buy one for a teenager - yours or someone elses.  Tell them to listen to it a couple of times.  This is what music should be.  99.9% of what is out there today will pale in comparison 
 This movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of sensous banality.  While the two protagonists are pretty to look at and you do get to look at them front and back it's the slick sick overlay of the girl's narration that really lifts it above a porn flick.  Just barely, pardon the pun.  Yet it is hypnotic in some strange way.  You can't pull your eyes away from the train wreck.  You can't stop looking at the victims.  
 This book can be used by a variety of professionals:  *Managers - they can understand the connection between strategy, business planning process, objectives, performane measurement; also the managers will learn to work better with performance improvment and project management experts, get used to spend enough time with planning, checking assumptions and objective definitions. In this way thye might see the "wasted time with planning and paper work" like and investment that will prove shortly it is a worth while one. *Performance management or projects managers - the experienced ones have a comprehensive review of the proccesses and activities involved in performance management. From this point of view the book is a good refference to come back from time to time in order to understand the "big picture". I'm doing this with great pleasure. Less experienced project managers might want to use this as a strating point in order to improve knowledge, to find out theirs future study needs and learn how to better plan and manage the next projects. *Accountants - to better understand the connection between financial measures and non financial ones. *Human Resources experts - to learn how to connect the individual performance with business results achievement, business plan, and business strategy. They also will find new ideas about how to improve the communication with management and "reinvent" HR role in business management.  The authors are doing a great job in explaining the connection between strategic planning and performance measures, presenting the steps to design and implement a strategy. They put a lot of attention in detailing the three architecture types we have to take care in preparing the project performance plan: organizational architecture, technological architecture and process architecture. After a clear presentation of balanced scorecards, it is shown how all the above information can be used for business planning, process performance measurement, and job performance measurement. Strongly recommended to the ones interested in increasing organizational capacity, in improving management and project management skills, in restructuring organization architecture and its activity. 
 I bought this for my brother, one of the ultimate Led Zeppelin fans and he loved it!  I loved it too.  We saw them in St. Paul at the now defunct Civic Center on April 13, 1977.  It was one of the greatest rock shows I ever saw!  This DVD brings much of that back.  It's great, what more can I say? Mike, the old rocker Eagan, M 
 This is a great book for women who have heard to many old tales about sex being a chore,or something you do for someone else....let  yourself go and regain your energy....and also\ sex is great for the cardiovascular system 
 My husband and I have found this book to be our "bible" when it comes with dealing with our two children.  Ms. Samalin gives concise, clear and often entertaining examples of real parents.  It is the most helpful  book I've read since "Siblings Without Rivalry" which was over a  decade ago!  "Loving Each One Best" is an absolute must read.  I  can't recommend it enough 
 After reading the reviews by other parents stating that this Lego set is "too much for a 7 year old" - well, I had to write something.  This is an excellent and very interactive set.  The age range is 7-12, so that does not mean you can drop it in the lap of your 7 year old and miracles will happen!  This set needs adult help for younger kids, while my older kid put it together in minutes!    It has great features which make it more than just building, you play catapult-like games with the highly creative toys you just built - a bed that throws SpongeBob out of it, 2 catapults for firing play jellyfish, and of course, a car and interactive basketball hoop inside SpongeBob's house.  Note to parents for kids 7-8, you may ACTUALLY need to get down on the ground and play with your kids!  Surprise!  Older kids can build this fairly easily and seem to invent a lot of games to play with their brothers/sisters.  I give this set 5 stars because it combines the challenge of buliding with legos, but has more small creative gizmos to play with once the set is built.  And as a last comment to people who complain that legos fall apart and need to be reassembled... duh!  If you like to play with your 7-9 year old and don't want to use legos as a babysitter, this is the top lego set available for the price!  For older kids, they will get a tremendous amount of enjoyment (provided they like SpongeBob) 
 H.G. Wells wrote War of the Worlds as a warning to the complacent, world-dominating British citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted. The arrogance of some British politicians in particular rubbed Wells entirely the wrong way, particularly their sentiment that the British had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world (read: colonize) for its own good. Well's book was a rock thrown at that attitude-on-a-pedestal, and although he didn't knock it down, he made his point- and in spectacular fashion. In one way, the Martians *were* the conquering British, with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of Africa and other areas colonized by force.  Wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the British- despite their firm belief in their world destiny- could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that didn't give one whit about the British (or anyone else's) false boast of superiority. In the end, though, it's a hopeful book- just as the Martians died off because they weren't biologically suited to live in this world, Wells also foretells the end of the British Empire because the British (alien) way was not the native way of life in the colonies, suggesting that the British wouldn't survive there long; the natives would eventually prevail. And they did. On top of all that, it's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense.  And that's why it's still in print a hundred years later.  -Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstei 
 John Adams is probably the most performed living American composer of classical music. And in this book, really a tribute to Mr. Adams, some sixty writers have written on some aspect of John Adams life. The essays are broken down into four major categories: Portraits of the Artist, The Musical Works, Collaborators and Interpreters, and Critical Reception. The book is biographical in part, talking of Mr. Adams early years and his decision to spend his life writing music. Other aspects of the book discuss most of his major works from looking at the content and then critically.   The writers of these essays are a who's who of the classical music world. They include performers (Emanuel Ax, Sarah Cahill), critics (Justin Davidson, Rupert Christiansen), composers (Ingram Marshall, David Schiff), critics (Renaud Machart, Alan Rich), directors (Robert Spano, Peter Spano), professors (Richard Taruskin, Arthur C. Danto), and of course Thomas May who basically put this whole book together 
 this cd has a good sound and variety of their greatest hits. you must be a drifter's fan to enjoy this one. 
 Considering how important Hattie McDaniel is to American movie history both for her talents and achievements, I've been surprised there are not more books about her. I was glad to discover Carlton Jackson's book. I'll mention the glitches first since I want to end on a positive note. Mr. Jackson mentions the constant confusion between Hattie, Louise Beavers, and Ethel Waters and this seems to extend to the copy editor and even Mr. Jackson himself. On Page 34 (paperback)it says "It is our intention to publicize her name as Hattie McDaniel, instead of 'the colored woman who was in Imitation of Life'....We have a feeling that Louise Beavers, cast in important pictures, can do much to enhance their entertainment value." I had to read this a few times before I realized the editor was confused and it should read "...publicize her name as Louise Beavers", since Hattie was not in that movie. This happens a few times throughout the book. And at the end, Mr. Jackson compares Hattie's funeral to a scene from Imitation of Life, but Hattie was NEVER in that movie, so it muddles things again. A factual mistake occurs on page 113 when mentioning James Baskett, who played Uncle Remus in Song of the South. Mr. Jackson states that he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Not true. Harold Russell won for The Best Years of Our Lives. Mr. Baskett was not nominated for an Oscar. He was, however, presented with a special Oscar for his performance as Uncle Remus. It's a minor thing, but does raise concerns about accuracy, since that is such an easy thing to check out. Anyway, glitches aside, I found this book to be very enjoyable and informative about Hattie McDaniel's life and career. The pages of pictures are a treat as well. The picture of her at age 15 is just beautiful. The book was worth the price and is a great read and should satisfy the reader until someone does a more in-depth and longer biography of this wonderful woman. 
 If you've ever wondered what the differences were between a tauntaun and a bantha, well than this is the book for you!  Lavishly illustrated with complete bios and histories on the denizens of the STAR WARS universe, you'll spend hours exploring a galaxy far, far away 
 This book is a good book for any age, but I think that it would be specifically helpful with mid-schoolers, ages 11-14. I'm an adult and I read it in an hour and a half. This is a light morality tale , if you get my meaning.  Written to illustrate our need for life's basic values, this book is presented as a series of "lessons" for a young man, aged 23 or 24.  Apparently, this main character will not recieve an inheritance if he does not perform 12 months of education, education mind you that his rich uncle has outlined for him.  He must learn a new lesson every month.  So, it's predictable and one wonders, "It only takes this kid 30 days to learn a huge life lesson? C'mon."  But remember, it is fiction, so suspend your disbelief.  All of the lessons the young man learns are definitely worth while and necessary, and they are lessons that are missing in today's typical teen toolbox.  The message is easy to get within the first 3 pages of the book.  Nothing is really held back and you'll have probably figured out the ending by chapter 4. A young teen, however, might find this book to be very interesting and an inspiration.  I did enjoy it.  I felt it was entertaining, but I also found it to be a bit of a cliche.  Do read it, however, and pass it along to a young person in your life. Then give them a copy of the "Once and Future King".  That's a book that will entertain young people and teach them many values, also. Now that's a book! And, it's one that an adult will enjoy too.   
 John Shaw has mastered Nature Photography in all its permutations, and this book has underscored his expertise by become the classic guide for both film and digital photographers.  If you're serious aboutg this type of photography, you owe it to yourself to buy, read, re-read, study, and memorize the information in this book 
 This is Orwell's fictional account of his real journeys in the Paris and London underworld. The first, and by far the most entertaining part of the book is set in Paris and recount the Narrator's experiences in near destitution, his various kitchen jobs as a dishwasher in Paris and the eccentrics that he meets along the way. In the second part of the book, set in London, the narrator essentially becomes a homeless vagabond and tramps around greater London while sleeping in boarding houses and other vermin infested flops. He brings to life and humanizes the homeless that are often discounted and dehumanized, even still.  Yet this part of the book is more uneven, and as it progresses takes on the tone of an analytical essay rather than that of autobiographical fiction. Unfortunately, the last chapters degenerate into a didactic analysis of the homeless situation in England. As always, Orwell's prose is economical and precise. Without rhetorical flourish or purple prose he really captures the scenes and odd characters that he makes acquaintance with while down and out. Those characters humanity in the face of utter destitution make his point better than his formal analysis ever could. That is the worth of a work of fiction over an essay. Had he stuck to the former this would have been a much better and more powerful work. As it stands it is still a wonderfully readable and evocative account, but it is not as good as it could have been had he not blurred the stylistic qualities of his writing 
 Since Monkeewrench is one of my all-time favorite books, my standards are high.  Snow Blind just didn't compare.  My husband and I have read all of P.J. Tracy's books and eagerly await each new work; but, if they'd write a book equally as good as their Monkeewrench and Dead Run, we'd wait longer for each new book 
 This book is just the thing if you need a little - or a lot - of motivation to jump start your life. I read it during a difficult time two weeks ago and it made a difference - thank you 
 a tome on the black man in europe, mainly martinique...basically what fanon is saying is : brothas try to be like the other, because they hate them selves and they desire to sleep with the other to give themselves  worth and that a  bad  environment and colonialism makes a black man bad ...reading the book is like reading a long prose poem, thoughtful and stunning...take the chance. it's extremely interesting.. 
 This is a great book for the new owner who hasn't been brought up aroung horses. It has great pictures and goes into a lot of detail about nutrition, vaccinations, illness/injury, age characteristics ect 
 Andy Straka's private eye, former policeman Frank Pavlicek, sprang into existence last year in "A Witness Above."  His debut in a briskly paced and well constructed mystery was memorable enough to attract not only the attention of readers, but the judging panels of the Agatha Award and the Shamus Award -- it has received nominations from both.  Now, in "A Killing Sky." Straka again demonstrates his prowess in another fully satisfying tale starring Pavlicek.  He has taken strands from several recent political scandals and woven them into a fresh, new, and completely ingenious plot that is totally plausible and logical.  The dialogue and action rings true every step of the way.  Pavlicek lives and works in Charlottesville, Virginia, near the Blue Ridge Mountains.  He enjoys, along with his buddy Jake Toronto, another ex-cop, the unusual hobby of falconry, a metaphor of sorts for his own search for prey -- and perps.  This novel will give an added frisson of pleasure to anyone familiar with Charlottesville, because it uses real sites as backdrops for much of the action.  You can easily follow Frank up and down the city streets and out into Albemarle county, lending added verisimilitude to the action.  When I first read "A Killing Sky" I was so engrossed that I raced through it at a dead run, eager to know just how the complex plot twists would play out, and who actually "dunnit."  Only on second reading did I become aware of and impressed by Straka's careful craftmanship, and how how lean, clean, and muscular his writing is.  "A Witness Above" was an imprssive first novel for any author, and "A Killing sky" only seconds the motion 
 Great animal fiction about man's best friend  	In Shiloh, West Virginia, a boy named Marty and a man named Judd became connected by a dog named Shiloh. Marty was worried about when Judd gets his dogs back he will turn them mean again. Marty is trying to find ways for Judd to be nice and take better care of his dogs. Marty tries to find was to help Judd. Marty finds out that Judd came from a family that abused him. In Judd's mind abusing is showing you care.  	Marty also finds out that if you are nice to a chained dog he will learn to be nice. Marty believed Judd was like a chained dog. He believed if he showed Judd he cares Judd will to change. By changing Judd will help his dogs. However, Judd would not open his doors until Marty bring over Shiloh. 	I really liked the book "Saving Shiloh" because it talks about how a dog can change people. This book also teaches a lesson if someone is being mean to you can change them by being nice. I really loved this book. It is a must read! It is great book for kids, who are 9 years old or older. Don't pass it up, read this fabulous book.       
 This book is an exquisitely written page-turner with a surprising double ending. I won't give it away but it takes the whole experience - the whole journey  - that the author takes us on, and leaves us with two options of how things really went down. I don't read books twice usually, but this one I could read again.   Between readings, I started thinking like Pi, if it were me stranded in the boat, having to be resourceful. It took me away, into another world in which I begin thinking of how I would live my last days. Clearly the story has a successful ending because it was written in first person. So I kept hanging on every page to find out where he'd wind up and how he'd manage in the elements with very little supplies.  FABULOUS BOOK 
 Martin's book is an excellent introduction to the practice of Value Based Management. Although it is far from being an MBA type book, it explains the basics and shows some good examples. Maybe the strongest point of the book is the comparison of several approaches used by the biggest consulting companies sponsoring VBM: Stern Stewart's EVA versus BCG's and McKinsey's measures. When you're ready to climb another step, the best choice is Young and O'Byrne's "EVA and Value Based Management". It goes deep in details of implementation of EVA based systems, is comprehensive and technically advanced and also give pros and cons of the measure

 I have read several books on the Iraq war and this one rates as one of the best.  It is well-written and moves at a crisp pace.  It is very informative, and takes the reader step-by-step through the whole mess over in Iraq.  The author tries to give an objective view of the war, but things are so bad in Iraq, that he can say very little that is good  about this whole "fiasco".   The author takes you step-by-step through the whole process:  the rationale for invasion, the actual invasion, and the aftermath.  If one is left with one great impression about this book, it is how little George W. Bush is mentioned.  It is not by design, but the fact is that Bush is so disconnected from what has happened in Iraq, that his input into the war is rare.  He seems totally disconnected from the realities of the war and is distressingly uninterested.  He asks few questions and ignores any bad news coming out of the war.  Bush is an intellectual lightweight, and it boggles the mind how this man was ever elected president.  One is left with a sick feeling for our country after reading this book.    
 A thoroughly engaging and accessible work, beautifully illustrated with many outstanding examples of woodcuts and wood engravings. Most readers will be itching to try their hand at this craft well before they've finished the book, and George Walker provides plenty of information to help you do just that. The writing is clear and readable, with a good balance of background information, practical tips and instructions, and resources for further reading. Although Walker makes no bones about the difficulty of mastering this craft, he encourages beginners to play and experiment, and gives many pointers to help you avoid the pitfalls. Obviously, his years of teaching experience have given him some insight into what people find trickiest about making printing blocks. He not only provides encouragement, he even gives instructions for repairing any mistakes you might make!   Other sections deal with how to select and care for tools (including how to keep them good and sharp); the pros and cons of different materials for blocks (various kinds of wood, linoleum, other synthetics) and different types of ink; choosing paper; ideas for arranging your workspace; how to make prints by hand or with a press (including instructions for making your own printing press!); and health and safety issues. He also suggests some interesting ways of using your finished prints, in addition to giving tips for mounting and storing them. The illustrations Walker has selected are both interesting and useful:  he gives many details about the different artists represented, and the tools, techniques, inks, and papers they use to make their prints. With examples of so many different styles and techniques, you get some idea of the wide range of possibilities to be explored.   The book is rounded out by a glossary, short bios of the artists whose work appears in the book, and a list of sources for info and materials, as well as a bibliography and an index, making it a valuable and inspiring reference for all levels of printmakers and anyone else with an interest in this art. At the same time, it is a well-organized, easy-to-follow manual that can help anyone get started making their own relief prints. Even people who don't yet know that they're interested in woodcuts or wood engravings will be won over by this beautiful and comprehensive book. Highly recommended 
 I got this before the series has been shown and I can tell the series will  be great.  It's wonderful to have all this information and the images in  one handy book.  It's well worth the price and I'm even going to use it for  a class.  A definitely necessity for anyone interested in US history, black  history, slave history, human history.  Kudos to the team 
 great stories from the master. excellent at details, truly chilling, great descriptions, noone can make as much out of the traditional ghost story. james no that one change is enough to make a completely different story. changing objects, persons, places, angles, james shows the complete potential of the ghost story. built up excellent, these stories are among the best read in horror. lurking evil, suggestive evil, warning of evil, sudden icy touches by ghostly hands. i have read a lot of horror, but james almost startles me. like that scene in the well, i could almost feel a hand on my shoulder 
 I wish Marty Layne was my neighbor!  How nice to have someone there to hold your hand, make a cup of tea and share tried and true advise.  Marty seems to be a real person, someone you can relate to without being  intimidated by her perfection!  Her book is easy to read, hard to put down  and indespensible.  I have referred back to the chapters time after time  for encouragement and reassurance and have never come away disppointed.  This book is a must have for any mother, homeschooling or not 
 I was amazed with the story of this man.  Thorp was careful to research the book, but this resulted in a dry read.  The book "Mountain Man" was a much more interesting read but did not reveal the true nature of Johnson.  Thorp did.  I have lived in these mountains and plains for 40 years and that made the book very interesting. I have been to many of the places in the book.  Worth reading 
 Well, the previous 2 books were showing that Mitch was losing his motivation to be Dirty Harry/SuperAgent and they were mostly action and no further character building.  But after this one motivation is back, I agree that the character building in this one is far greater than in the previuous books but it is not boring considering that newer and deeper motivations and games are played.  At the end is predictable but nonetheless hard to put down. Vince Flynn has revived the series which was becoming dull. 
 Excellent business strategy primer for the Internet age. Peppers and Rogers methodically review how to fully exploit the advantages and opportunities of the online economy.

 I do my research by shadowing high school students through their academic experiences. In my work, I am interested in how youth engage with each other and with ideas. Sadly, when it comes to engagement around ethical or moral issues, much of what I witness veers between "shock-radio" confrontation or systematic avoidance of any issue tinged with conflict or moral weight. In other words, bare-knuckle polemics or silence holds sway.  Writing with the acuity of a philosopher and the on-the-ground savvy of a veteran high school teacher-Kunzman offers a framework for understanding why the public school classroom must be a place for our diverse students to tangle and grapple with moral disagreement and combustible issues-particularly around our religious beliefs. Kunzman moves between sophisticated but accessible philosophical claims and providing detailed and authentic examples of "real" students and teachers "grappling with the good," the ambiguous, and the uncertain. As I finished this gem of a book, I jotted in the margin: "This is the kind of book John Dewey or Richard Rorty would write if they had worked as a high school teacher for a decade before they turned to full-time philosophy. 
 This Video Card is the best that i `ve got !!!! Fantastic !! 
 They do not make music like this anymore.  This will send your heart to the time when tradition and family meant something.  One of my favorite CD's to relax to and of course play while making macaroni and gravy..   
 With his usual attention to the everyday details that really paint the picture of his subject, Kessler delivers a flattering and interesting portrayal of the extremely likeable Laura Bush. How refreshing to read about someone on the national scene who isn't driven by ego and attention seeking! Don't miss this one 
 This book is extremely detailed and the author is right on with symptoms and the emotions attached to panic and anxiety. It really helps you understand what your body and mind are going through. It is very comforting to know that someone can explain your feelings and physical symptoms because when you suffer from anxiety and panic you feel as though you are the only one and that no one understand 
 I bought'Aerobics' by this author in 1975 when I was 43 and slipping into the state where I was puffing to tie my shoe laces a friend recommended the book. Without doing anything too drastic in the diet department other than to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and skip fried food.  I started off in the Poor category and commenced the running programme by walking the first week for 1 mile, having to make an effort to do so in under 20 minutes on the first day.  I followed Dr Coopers directions and was amazed to find how accurate his time estimates were and how well I felt as I reduced from 110 Kgs to 85 Kgs within 5 months. I retired when I turned 69 and now at 73 I have a need to get my arse into gear as my weight has crept up and my cardiovascular system is in dire need of rejuvenating. I note Dr Cooper has fine tuned his work and I am embarking on his cycling programme with confidenc

 Two of my favorite contemporary writers have died unexpectedly in the past few months - the Mississippi writer Larry Brown and, more recently, Hunter S. Thompson, who committed suicide on Feb. 20.   Both were deaths that affected me greatly.  Usually when I hear of a notable passing, my reaction is, "Oh, no," but in both of these cases my first thought was to hope that the news wasn't true.    In the days following Thompson's death, I found myself going over some of his work - a documentary on the Criterion "Fear & Loathing" DVD, "The Great Shark Hunt" and "Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas."   But the book that I found myself reading the most, and finding a kind of solace in, is this one: Thompson's collected letters from 1968-76.  I used to work in a bookstore and there was always a question of where "Las Vegas" belonged.  It obviously wasn't fiction but it also couldn't be entirely true, and that's part of its genius.  But with "The Gonzo Letters, Volume II" there is no doubt that this is the genuine article, this is probably the closest look we'll get at what Thompson was like.  The sheer fact that he wrote and saved so many letters in the first place tells you a lot about the man himself.  The correspondence here runs the gamut: letters to Oscar Acosta, Tom Wolfe, Charles Kuralt, William Kennedy, Jann Wenner, his brother, his mother, his broker and anybody he had a beef with.  The letters take us through his early ups and downs, his campaign for sheriff of Pitkin County and we not only get to follow him through the success of "Las Vegas," but also part of the process of him refining surrealism and colorful exaggeration into the style he'd use in that book.   And tucked away in the book, on page 181 is a letter that gave me a smile and a shiver of sadness as I read it with the news playing in the background on TV.  It's a May 19, 1969 letter to the Disabled American Veterans Association, in response to a solicitation for a donation.  Thompson opposed the then-raging war in Vietnam and was flabbergasted that the DAV would support it.  His reply is so fierce and funny and sad that it even stung me, a bystander, 35 years later. 
 I'm suspect to talk about this stuff... I got almost every tracks, with the original players or not, and I was looking for this CD. Now I will listen to it til it be on the memory of my player.  Go ahead people and buy it too... then you'll feel what I fell when listening The Peanut soundtracks 
 For Pixies fans, this is a must. The concert footage from a 1988 UK show has to be one of the greatest concerts recorded. It shows how dedicated Charles, Joey, David and Kim are to their music. Kim looks hypnotized most of the time. David's drumming is close to perfect. Joey looks like he's afraid of the crowd. Charles is typical Black Frances; Mad at the world and laughing at it.  The documentary, Gouge, is great. Not only does it provide you with details about the band, it demonstrates how influential the Pixies are to modern rock.  The tour footage is okay. There's good spots, but they're in the middle of some very boring scenes.  Last, the Videos. Pixies are not known for "show", and these videos show that. None of them are really worth watching, to be quite honest, but Veloria provides you with a few panty shots of Kim, which isn't too bad (though this is probably one of the worst videos ever). 
 It is precisely what it claims to be. If you're going to come over here, you should read it. So much information, all in one place. My life would've been much easier if I'd read this five years ago, but perhaps Who Moved My Rice? wouldn't be quite so much fun.   If you plan to do business with the Chinese, consider this book mandatory.  
 After seeing BARAKA on a wide screen in 1996, I felt like I had been viewing the world with blinders on and all of a sudden they were blown right off. This visual documentary filmed in 49 countries is a MUST SEE for anyone who appreciates the aesthetic world and evocotive music. Being an artist, this ROCKED MY WORLD and opened up endless possibilities for me as an independent filmmaker. It also forced me to sit with deep inquiry and catapulted me into exploring other parts of the world. I share it with everyone I know! Ron Fricke is a genious 
 This is a low-end product, but performs well.  Has played everything I've fed it so far.  Problem with blank screen cited by another reviewer is a Catch 22.  If you hook-up component video out of the box, you may get a blank screen because the unit is not set for component output (a selection you make during setup).  I hooked up S-video which gave me a screen, made the component selection in setup, and reattached the component cables.  Works fine 
 Heywood and Dworkin draw on a variety of sources in this thoughtful examination of female athletes, including content and textual analysis and critical and gender theory. Their writing is scholarly and thouroughly researched, yet will also be interesting to non-academic readers. The commentary on various advertisements and other cultural artifacts such as the movie "Fight Club" are very good, as are their explorations of the conumdrums and contradictions encountered by women athletes over how they represent themselves and are represented by others. They also touch more generally on how gender roles and images have changed, not just for women but for men as well.  This is a must-read for women athletes, those who support them, and anyone interested in the topics of sports and gender.  --Vince Prygoski, author of "Worst to First, or, a 'Shock'ing tale of Women's Basketball in Motown" (available from Amazon.com

 This is a great book, but make sure you're getting the latest edition.  The author published a 3rd edition in October 2005, which you can find on Amazon by searching for ISBN 0782144470 
 When I first got this book, I was a bit ticked that I paid thirteen dollars for a book that was only around a hundred pages. But once I read it, I knew it was well worth the money. Every sentance is informative. It confronts many daily aspects of life that are affected when one has DID and how to overcome that. Its not full of psycho-mumbo-jumbo but how to handle everyday thigns like taking medicine, raising the kids, sexual activity, work, and respect among the alters. It is truly an owners manual for those with DID. 
 This is a great little receiver.  At the price I paid it's untouchable.  I wasn't even planning on buying a receiver but for the price I paid plus a $20 gift card, I couldn't resist.  Besides, it wouldn't hurt to upgrade the older Sony I was using that was relying on my DVD player's DD and DTS decoding.  I was reluctant because I had not done any research but I figured dirt cheap entry level cira 2006 had to be better than dirt cheap circa 2000.    After having tried it out, I'd have to agree with the few professional reviews I could fine.  One reviewer said if you didn't need all the bells and whistles of this reciever's older sibling the VSX-816, this one was sonically just as good minus 10 extra watts per channel.  CNet said the 816 was a much better value, but they weren't taking into account how much I had paid.  They said the 816 was an excellent value.  And The Perfect Vision named the 816 as part of their budget system of the year.  They said, "This receiver sounds good and works well, meaning it's nothing like typically wimpy-sounding budget AVR's."  So if what the reviewers were hearing was anything like what I'm getting from my 516, I think I made a sound investment.  As for the sound, it is noticably clearer than my old receiver.  It certainly has much more updated features than my older receiver including Componenet switching and 7.1 surround.  It does not, however, have s-video switching, but I was using an outboard switcher for lack of switching on my old receiver anyway.    If I were paying full price, I would definitely pay the extra $100 and go for the 816.  But then actually, I wouldn't have bought anything because, as I said, it wasn't actually in the plans.  I'm glad I got the deal though.  I'm very pleased with my purchase 
 I agree with the reviewers who've described this as a slow read. No argument there. But it's also a very important 18th Century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period.  If you read the book with an ironical slant it's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations. Granted, it may not be laugh out loud humor, but it is there. The poor vicar is modeled on the biblical Job, to a very exaggerated extent.  It's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes, I know.  If you're looking for tight plot and fast pace this won't be your book, but those reading 18th Century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now.  You don't read THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD for the plot. You read it for the study.  It remains an important book 
 Decent read finally from this author, this is probably due to the fact that there is a co-author.  I give credit to this book to Joel, without him I think it would be another dud by Michelle.  Good advice and easy to read, the authors could have done a better job of using first person statements

 Ted Loder is the best kind of preacher ... one who is not obviously preaching. His storytelling is magnificent and his message is inspiring. For those who have lost faith in the whole faith industry, "The Haunt of Grace" should provide some hope, not just of a higher presence, but that we can find inspiration in common things around us 
 I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I enjoyed this immensely. I just can't find a single thing wrong with it and never tire of it. It's fantastic. It's an extraordinary story with an extraordinary cast 
 This is a very nice looking book that not only provides context about the Harlem Renaissance and the proliferation of Black artists during the 20's and 30's, but it also includes many reproductions of some of the period's most representative works. From the cover photo which is a copy William Johnson's "Boy in a Vest," to the James VanDerZee's striking black and white photography, to the sculptures of Meta Warwick, the reader is treated to many examples of the visual arts. There are also essays and poems by the Countee Cullen and other writers of the time. This is a good introduction to the period and is suitable for children and young adults. And old adults too for that matter 
 I don't really know how to describe it but I'd have to say that "Rapid Fire","Breaking the Law" and Steeler are the best songs on there. I'd probably pick Rapid Fire as my fav. It's fast and powerful and Prieset's guitar solos are awesome 
 Dalton Conley has written a very good book looking at race relations through the prism of his life growing up white in a largely minority project of New York City.  What comes out of his writing are two points.  First: Being the minority in any situation is not good.  Conley writes about being picked on and beat up for being white.  He writes about being the provebial outsider because of his skin color.  He writes about his various friends of different colors and the politics surrounding their friendships in the hood.  Interestingly, he writes about being treated differently by the teachers because of his skin color.  Conley writes about not being hit by minority teachers because they thought that white parents were soft on their children and they would not allow him to be struck.  Do I hear the word stereotype? HMMM...  Second: There are advantages to being white, even if you are poor.  This is one point that Conley drives home time and time again.  Yes he was beaten up for being white, but he also was able to go to better schools due to connections of his parents.  You find out all of the parents that cared for their children tried to move them to better schools with the address game, except because his parents had friends in better neighboorhoods he was able to go to the schools his friends couldn't.  Conley was also able to go to the country for summer vacation that his peers did not have access.  His parents were poor, but also educated and that made a difference in his life.  Conley had a role model which helped him leave the projects.  This book is poignant.  I lived a somewhat similar life as a white kid among minorities for a good number of years.  While my experiences are not exactly the same, they do have similar bases of being beat up for being white and trying to steer through the racial politics of friendship when your friends abandon you because it is easier than standing and doing the right thing in the face of large groups.  Being treated differently in school by teachers agravated various situations, even if the teachers were minorities themselves and were doing the right thing for all concerned.  These are some of the same experiences, but not on the harsh level he lived.  Honky is a good read and gives some insight to living white inside minority neighborhoods.  A good comparison to "Honky" is "All Souls" by Michael Patrick McDonald.  A story of an Irish Catholic family growing up in South Boston.  There is plenty of racism there also, but from the other side and growing up depseratly poor is the key to both books.  Highly Recommende 
 THE ZOO STORY IS THE BEST PLAY EVER WRITTEN 
 Loved the actors, loved the music and scenery. Lovely!  Fun and adventurous, set in Ireland. Cute, funny actors, make this delightful fun.   Laughed out loud when the town "witch" took flight. Very much enjoyed the two best friends as they plot to get the lottery money.   See it. Laugh out loud Fun. 
 What can I say about this album? Only that it is one of the best I've ever listened to and had the pleasure to own. It comes very very close to being almost perfect. And I say almost because I don't really like Computer Blue, but even that song isn't bad.  Here, Prince is at his zenith. And even with subsequent great outputs like Sign O The Times, none of his albums eclipse the greatness of Purple Rain.    
 My family lives in Alaska, so I started to read with some trepidation.  And then, I started laughing, until I couldn't breathe, tears rolled down my face and I slid out of my chair. A hard hearted, calculating business woman, Alex coldbloodedly sets out to Alaska (because of the favorable male:female ratio, don't you know)to find a husband.  And she does - just not what she planned on.  Of course, she also didn't plan to fall in the drink, or get stuck with a gunshop, or ... well, read it for yourself.  Ms. Evanovich scores once more, for truth, justice and love in odd corners 
 The book was cut into two parts by the publisher withoutPauline Reage's knowledge.  I have read several other reviews by otherreaders here on Amazon, and just wanted to add some info andimpressions.  History-wise, "Reage" was a very well knownwoman, a feminist in France in the 50s.  She died within the last tenyears.  There is a full-length book interview with her that I own thatis out of print, published when the book was first re-released in theUSA in the 70s... quite fascinating.  So, to clarify, what has beenpublished on "O" is 1) The original truncated book in Francein the 50s and USA from the 70s on.  2) The original ending as"Return to the Chateau" in the late 70s or 80s.  3) Eitherjust before or just after, a rip-off called "Story of O"Part II that makes "O" into a dominatrix.  4) At least oneillustrated version of the original book.  5) A film version in the70s -- reviewed in Time Magazine at the time, starring Corinne Clery-- hot, hot, hot-- and 6) the 10 part Video set sold on Amazon.com --also pretty darn hot.  Contemporaneous with "O" in the 50'sa book called "L'Image" (the Image) was also published bysomeone rumored to be Reages lover...  I can also say that I find thebook wholly well-written, erotic, fascinating and interesting, but cannot avoid doing so due to my own interests.  Some of the scenes inthis book, as well as Part I, are quite indelible in my mind.  Oh,well, I am probably at 1000 words.  ....  ... 
 I don't know how this woman can come up with such beautiful, detailed, unique designs! They are gorgeous, and I actually like each and every design in the book. There are many drawn pictures that tell the exact order of beads in addition to written instructions, making it easy to follow. I recommend this book to anyone who likes shiny, delicate, detailed jewelry who wants to be complimented 
 By: Jeffrey W. Bennett, author of the Christian novel, Under the Lontar Palm. Frankly, this novel helps identify strong characters that men can study.  In my continuous search for positive male role models, I have struck gold again in Love Comes Softly.  Clark, a Godly man, receives Marty, a young widow, into his life.  He's strong enough to help her through her mourning, loves her while she is pregant with her late husband's child and continues to be a great father to his own daughter.    Clark shows us how to be a real man, unlike many of the "heroes" we are forced to endure in other novels of late.  
 Written by a student of occult traditions and nature spirituality of 25 years' experience, The Druidry Handbook: Spiritual Practice Rooted In The Living Earth is a straightforward manual of traditional British Druid practice. Chapters discuss druid traditions in the contemporary world, the three triads of druid philosophy, and the different paths of initiation into druid followings: the earth path, the sun path, and the moon path. From a practical outline to planting trees, to lists of druidic symbols with their pronunciations and definitions, to step-by-step instructions in druidic ceremonies, The Druidry Handbook is a solid reference for anyone seeking to practice or simply learn about this ancient spiritual tradition. 
 This book is a comprehensive treatment of the history of the frisbee and how it came to be the ubiquitous disc that we know today.  Collectors will value the pictoral guide that allows for quick identification of classic  frisbees.  Now if I can only find my 1978 165G World Champion Frisbee that  is featured on page 156.  Sigh.. 
 I enjoyed this book. I'll read anything by author Susan Vreeland, after having read a couple of her books and been drawn into her stories fully during that time. A good read 
 A quite interesting book about visual arts since '1960 written by the author and editor of "Anti-Aesthetics".@Especially the analysis of the recent relationship between Art and Anthropology/Ethnography is  unique and suggestive 
 The growing climate is harsh in the Rockies, so I appreciated the detailed advice for all kinds of plants and trees. Very practical and for year-round use 
 Great item to have on hand. Used the first wheel up cleaning/repairing the kids cd collection. Pop in a fresh wheel and your ready for the next time 
 I should not have bought this book. There's no question it is an excellent resource, but I bought it expecting artwork and there is NONE in this book! Buy it if you are an active collector looking for Bonestell's very hard-to-find paintings in magazines and books, but if you're looking for a book of his art, this isn't it 
 the Mini SD card was sent to me pretty fast and i was happy with the purchase. I would buy something from this seller again for sure 
 If your heartstrings don't stretch a bit in response to some story in Chicken Soup for the Gardener's Soul, you need to check your pulse. Then you need to go plant something.. 
 Definitely their most commercial album and in that sense to most people probably their best. Nothing will ever touch Master of Puppets in my opinion, but from beginnning to end this a top notch album without a single weak track. If you're a diehard metal fan and never listen to anything else, you might want to avoid this one and stick with the pre-black albums. However, if you love a solid hard rock/metal album this is one of the handful that is a must own 
 Although I've read this book before, this time, as an older and wiser reader I was able to recall a lot more information and specifics that had slipped my mind since the previous reading.  As a non-native spanish speaker, it was easy to follow, in a dialect I could easily translate if necessary.  Plus, this book is useful in the spanish classes that I teach in portraying a realistic view of guatemalan history.  
 This CD is really great.  I first heard them online and loved their single "Dance Me Tonight" This is a great up-and-coming band and i think everyone should check them out 
 Actually this film really deserves 10+ stars! I first saw this movie on pay per view somewhere in the later part of the 90's and you know how there are really only a few titles to great flicks that you can actually remember? Put it this way, 9 years later I still never forgot "My Family" The cast is wonderful & the acting couldn't be better. It reaches into the soul of the heart and is one heck of a film that you'll never forget.. 
 I saw the second title of this series at my local Borders bookstore, and decided to try the first title. Do not be fooled by the "Young Adult" category; this book is also appropriate for full adults looking for a good read. Though a little adolescent at times, this novel is still excellent, and I recommend it as a fun and fascinating fantasy 
 Not much to say other than this is a great product.  It is similar to the Myoplex Lite (peanut butter crisp too) bars, but has much lower sugar content 
 This book is an excellent supplement for teaching employee training and development as a course. I'd recommend combining it with Noe's text (Employee Training and Development) for a college or graduate level course on this subject. The book is also a good stand-alone reference for teaching aspects of active training to a firm's curriculum development staff 
 I didn't buy this book after reading the first person's book.  A friend gave it to me as a gift because I'd read the other books.  I really enjoyed it.  The gay characters & romance/relationship are featured throughout the book - not just in the final 20 pages.  What I like about TJB's books is that they feature gay and straight characters.  Although the flow of the book gets a bit choppy and times, it's worth reading if you look a novel featuring an ensemble of characters and the way their lives interweave. 
 Although she is only 20 months old, she loves the Moon in my Room She comes and gets me, asking for the remote, then she likes to cycle through the phases of the moon using the remote. When summer comes we will go outside and watch the real moon. Great product, works as advertised. 
 I love this book.  My mom used to read it to me when I was small, and it has always been one of my favorites. I lost my original book many years ago but now that I am an aunt I have searched high and low to relocate it as a gift for my nephew.  The short stories in the book are touching as well as humorous and have a way of gripping readers both young and old! 
 This is a great book about family and family values.  It's a simple life and everyone relys on each other.  It is wonderful 
 Deaver does a good job here of pulling off a surprise ending that I doubt you will see coming.  I found the protagonist, a young female film maker named Rune, an engaging and interesting character, and her relationship with the bomb squad officer was an important aspect of the book for me, but the other characters, with the possible exception of Nicole, one of the porn actresses, were, as far as I was concerned, only there for the plot.  The book was a good read for me, and I enjoyed the plot twists 
 This book is something special, I have brought 8 book on Visual Basic .NET and none of them compared to the information of this book. I would the first 4 or 5 chapters of those other books and would not learn anything, this book takes you throught real examples and it is written for all levels. I am a mid-level programmer and I was very impressed 
 Excellent movie.  Jack rules 
 This game is very good. They only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool. The game folows the movies well. You can even blow up buildings. The only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave. Lastly, you can get in high speed cases with the cops 
 Director-scriptwriter Robert Rossen provides a realistic glimpse into the dirty world of the pool hall, and makes it a battleground on which strength and courage are tested...   Fast Eddie is not the traditional, heroic white knight... He's a crafty pool hustler, a man who makes his money by tricking opponents into thinking he's not as good as he really is... But he wants more than cheap hustling--his ambition is to beat the country's top player, Minnesota Fats, and this places him with Newman's other obsessed seekers of grand goals...   Newman really gets inside the character--makes us feel his desperate drive... In the opening scenes, depicting Eddie's marathon match with Fats (Jackie Gleason), he personifies overwhelming confidence, coolness and conceit; as Eddie puts it, he's "fast and loose." He grins, moves with assurance around the table, and baits Fats: "I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about it every night on the road. Five ball. You know, this is my table, man. I own it."  But there's an underlying insecurity, and a self-destructive tendency... He doesn't know when to stop, and even though he's $18,000 ahead, he won't quit until Fats is demolished... His cockiness leads him to become careless and eventually to fall into a drunken stupor... Fats, in contrast, remains casual and emotionally serene, and he takes all of Eddie's money... As Fats' manager, the crafty, snake-like Gordon (George C. Scott), says, Eddie's "a loser."  Eddie's arrogance is unpleasant and his lack of restraint is pathetic, but he's partially redeemed by his affair with Sarah (Piper Laurie), a self-pitying, sore, worn-out alcoholic, whose vulnerability attracts him... It's a splendidly enacted relationship between two derelicts, beginning as a casual pickup and developing into tentative affection... Initially all they do is drink and make love, and, even though Sarah (Piper Laurie) realizes he is not much better than a bum, she (like many women in Newman films) wants more... The turning point occurs when Eddie again loses his restraint and shows off to some men he's hustling, whereupon they break his thumbs... Now, for the first time, he needs Sarah's help, and their relationship deepens as he realizes his dependence upon her...  And she's the only person he can talk to about what most moves him... In a picnic on a hillside--one of the best scenes in Newman's career--Eddie explains that he lost his restraint with the small-time players because he had to show them what pool is like "when it's really great." He says that at times he becomes so immersed in pool that his arm and the cue perform as one beautifully functioning organism... This speech is rendered almost poetic by Newman's passionate expression and delivery; together with earlier scenes in which we saw Eddie's movements in the game and his look of admiration at Fats' grace, it convinces us that whether he wins or loses, Eddie is alive only when playing pool...  Sarah is moved to express her love, but the closest he can come is: "You need the words?" She does, but he can't say them... And ultimately, whatever love he may feel is overshadowed by the all-consuming need to get back at Fats... He cruelly rejects his fatherly manager (Myron McCormick), who has no such haughty ambitions, and becomes a slave to Gordon, who says he'll always be a loser unless he rids himself of Sarah...  "The Hustler" is Newman's most balanced characterization--on the one hand, ruthless ambition, arrogant confidence and inability to express love; on the other, vulnerability, recognition of dependence and genuine self-realization--and he brings it all off to perfection... It was his most critically acclaimed performance to that time... The film received nine Oscar nominations, including Newman's second as Best Actor... The award went to the vastly inferior Maximilian Schell (Judgment at Nuremberg), but Newman did win the British Academy Award...   
 Nicholas of Cusa is a rare and lonely genius who straddles the time of change between the late medieval period and the early Renaissance.  A cardinal in the Roman Church, Cusa like many more modern mystics, led a highly active as well as contemplative life.    This collection of writings includes Cusa's most important work, 'On Learned Ignorance' as well as several smaller works including 'The Vision of God' and 'The Unknown God.'    Cusa's mysticism is deeply speculative and intellectual, perhaps more so than any other Christian mystic except Eckhart and Eriugena.  At the heart of Cusa's mysticism is God's absolute infinity, which renders God utterly and entirely incomprehensible to the human mind.  Because incomprehensibility is not merely due to a defect of the human mind but is an attribute of God himself, Cusa rigorously adopts a strongly apophatic approach to God, developed along lines already laid out by Dionysius the Aeropagite, Eckhart, and Scotus Eriugena.    In the Learned Ignorance Cusa likens God to the 'absolute maximum' who while ineffable, contains the fullness of being and reality.  The absolute maximum is God's essence as it is in itself, what philosophers might now call the Absolute.  In the absolute maximum, which is basically God's infinite nature, all coincidences and opposites merge into one basic unity.  In other words, the many become the one and the one becomes the many in God's plenitude of being.    Cusa then goes on to describe how God is related to the universe.  The universe is the absolute contractum or minimum, crudely a mirror of God's infinity and infinite itself, but not God.  The universe presents the believer with an overwhelming expression of God's ineffability, however God himself by virtue of his absolute infinity remains shrouded in incomprehensibility and mystery.  One of Cusa's favourite sayings is the ancient maxim 'God is a sphere whose circumference is everywhere and centre is nowhere.'    Cusa also argues that as God is radically unknowable, also the universe is in a way radically unknowable.  Humans are engaged in an ever deepening vision of God through creatures, though God himself will forever remain unknown to the created mind.  Like Eriugena and Eckhart, Cusa pushes his apophatic theology and mysticism to the very limit and seems to argue at times even creatures themselves are somehow theophanies or appearances of deeper realities or reality which we can never know.  In this sense he seems to anticipate Kant, who put a radical barrier between the knowable and the unknown.    Cusa's vision of God contains astonishing philosophical and theological depth which remains unmatched until the arrival of Spinoza.  His vistas of an infinite universe are perhaps unmatched until the arrival of the mystical cosmology of Giordo Bruno and the universe of Isaac Newton.    While perhaps Cusa's vision may not be appropriate for today's universe, his courage in exploring the hidden deeps of God's being are to be admired for their profoundity and originality, and one looks forward with hope to the next Cusa who will integrate all things into a grand vision before which one feels only awe.  
 It was my first book that I bought on Aikido, and although I bought quite a few more in the 9 years that I practise Aikido now, I haven't found another one that gives one such a comprehensive view on this martial art. It covers the history, the philosophy, the basic ideas and techniques, some guidance and hints for training. And, best of all, the graphics, by their simplicity are vastly more instructive than the standard series of photographs 
 This book is a wonderful tribute to all the things that can happen during a deployment. It's a humorous approach to life as we know it in the military. Deployments come and go, it's how we survive them that tells us who we are! While the very few negative comments on this site suggest the book is not for everyone, I disagree. It IS for everyone. Ms. Kay's book is not a protocol manual on what steps to take at a spouse coffee nor lists the hierarchy of a Family Readiness Group. It IS a book that helps families cope with the everyday life and mishaps that arise during deployment or periods of spearation. It is helpful to hear how others have gone before you, and to know that you are not in this alone. I found this book to be a great shoulder to lean on, a confidante, and recommended it to my battalion spouses. The idea that "this, too, shall pass" makes me feel that we can always endure more than what we think we can. Deployments are not designed to make spouses stronger, that's just the unintended benefit. (Be sure to read the other books by Ellie Kay, as she has some fabulous tips on finances! 
 This is such a fantastic and moving CD. Written with such exhilaration and power, Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind is sure to become a staple in classical music. What joy to hear the music of this gifted composer, Osvaldo Golijov 
 This is a wonderful book for those interested in the history of the Roma.  It does generalize some of the finer points of the history, but it still works because of the fact that the author had to deal with so much information to put into one book.  If you can only buy one book on the history of the gypsies, this is the one 
 The perfect mix of brash and polish, Superstar Car Wash is the ultimate listening experience for those of us still in love with the music of the 90's.  Every song is solid and every song is toe tapper.  Definitely one of the Goo's best albums, and surprising to anyone who isn't familiar with early Goo Goo Dolls sounds, for it is mature and thoughtful but not cheesy or contrived.  The highlights on the album are "We Are the Normal"; "Stop the World"; "Another Second Time Around"; "Cuz You're Gone" and "Already There", but every song rocks!!!  
 Great series, you should get all the DVDs in this series since it is a on gooing storyline, but you can figure it out one at a time. I do think Marvel needs to stop worrying so much about how much money they can make off releasing these 4 epidoes at a time and look at releasing seasons at a time. I refuse to buy them all one disc at a time then later on buy a new re-released season set. Plus they are way behind on releasing these, so hurry up Marvel! Wonderful DVDs to own though 
 This hard drive came out of the box and worked just as stated. It's fast, reliable and no problems of any sort. 
 I took a class from Professor Bauer at Virginia Tech (the title eludes me) about pseudoscience - Loch Ness monster hunts, cryptozoology, UFO's, Cold Fusion, Kirlian Photography, Psychic/Palm Readings,  etc. - and this was a  supplemental text for the class. The book really explores how the  Scientific Establishment/Hierarchy operates and how it isn't all that  "objective" after all. Scientists are people, after all, and with  that comes all the animosities, territoriality, envy, back-stabbing, and  greed that all people exhibit. Radical discoveries by groups of people may  get ignored, dismissed offhand, or viciously attacked by the establishment  so as to preserve the integrity and perceived authority that the  establishment weilds. Science is not an immaculate, dust and static free  process - there are struggles and paradigm shifts all the time - and the  general public tends to think it is just the opposite. I recommend this  book for anyone who likes to challenge conventional modes of thinking and  re-examine some of the longest-standing illusions about science ever  created 
 Baldacci once again made me loose track of time during a couple days while reading Absolute Power. His story is so gripping, you can hardly wait to turn to the next page.If you like to get stuck to a book, get this one, you will not be sorry 
 This one's a true original.    Forget all the chop socky tired foolery about vengeful students seeking bloody justice over murdered masters or bright eyed, bald Shaolin monks teaching the uninitiated and unwashed a thing or two about fighting and philosophy.  This one's about money.  It's also about treasure, about deception, backstabbing and backbiting, oh and did I also mention masks?  Five Deadly Venoms rocks and socks with some of the most memorable fight scenes ever filmed for a period Kung-Fu flick.  And that's why we rent em and buy em, right?  The action!  Watch this one before you pop in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill.  This one has to be one of QT's favorites and it may just become a favorite of yours too.   
 This is a very good book on the subject of Tibetan Buddhism. It's understandable and you can read it like a novel. Very enjoyable. Sogyal Rinpoche explains the concepts in a way that I can relate to 
 Download takes awhile, but the picture quality was great, even full screen. It played all the way through. And, to boot, it's an excellent show 
 Well! I'm glad I read this!    The "Scopes Monkey Trial" has fascinated me for years. Like many others, however, the majority of my knowledge came from the movie/play "Inherit The Wind."    This book clearly and in great detail gives us the story of the actual trial, including many quotes from the trial transcript and contemporary newspaper accounts and editorials. It explains the political atmosphere of the "Roaring Twenties" and delineates the chain of events and political thinking that led to the enactment of the Tennessee anti-evolution law and the subsequent trial of John Scopes of Dayton, Tennessee, for teaching evolution in spite of the law. (I was astounded to learn that Mr. Scopes was enlisted by the town fathers to flout the law as a method to garner publicity for their dying town.)    The author also provides an in-depth analysis of "Inherit The Wind" and its place in history, plus a detailed (and scary) look at the more recent creationist surge in the American education system.    An excellent book, well-researched and documented.  
 A friend, knowing my interest in World Warll history, bought an original "Brave Men" 1944 copywright Henry Holt & Co edition at a used bookstore fo[$$$]. My great luck to have such good friends and I get to read such a wonderful book.  Any serious WWll history reader must read this book. Ernie Pyle's work is an American treasue.  He wrote about the lives of the common soldier, sailor, airman.  These are the "Brave Men".  The guy that just does his job as best he can while trying to survive and get home in one piece.  My father, a combat rifle platoon leader with the 9th division in France and Germany in 1944, once told me that he was no hero, and he wasn't brave, but he saw a lot of guys that were. Funny how they all say that.  Ernie's book is about guys like my dad and a million other anonymous guys like him that did the dirty work of war. They're my heros 
 As a square corners and center of the frame type, thanks to Bryan Peterson, I am learning to approach a potential image with more thought as to a more creative and more interesting presentation for the viewer. His sample photos that support his teachings give me a chance to practice his style while I seek to find mine.  Bill Brenna 
 It was recieved earlier than expected and in perfect condition. I was very satisfied with my purchase 
 You'll find Bryson in good form here, always the witty observer and critic.   The only criticism I have (and this applies to almost all his other travel books too) is that the sketch he includes of England (and I wouldn't dream of calling it a map) is woefully inadequate, if the point is to allow readers to find where in the country his travels take  him to.  In "Notes from a Small Island" the "map" is the size of a car key.  80% of the towns/places Bryson visits are not even shown on the pathetic key-sized sketch.  The irony here is that one of the tirades that appears in all Bryson's books concerns the deficiencies in maps he uses when he drives or hikes himself.  Granted the map in his books aren't expected to be used for navigating, but it would sure help if a reader could locate the places he describes in the book.    All in all an entertaining trip up and down England.  
 I got this book when my son was first diagnosed with ADHD and it is wonderful.  It helped me understand what he was going through and him understand that he was just different.  This book helped him to realize that he wasn't alone and that there are ways to help him help himself.  My son feels that he has more control of things and is not afraid to ask questions or for help when needed. He not embarrased by ADHD it's just part of who he is.  
 the product came within 3 days. it wasn't a long wait and the item was in excellent condition! thanks guys 
 If you like Kelsey Grammer and probably even if you don't you will love this movie.  It is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Definitely in my top ten of all time 
 I agree with the other poster, this should have gained a better recognition. I had never heard of it until today, I happened to catch it on tv, unfortunate because I had to deal with commercials. A sad movie but excellent acting, a lot of familiar faces and a wonderful story. Will own this soon 
 I have been searching for this CD for a very long time. I found it listed in other dealers inventory lists but when I went to order it all of them said that it was not in stock and It would be sent to me at a later date.  Within 30 days I would receive an e-mail informing me that my order was being cancelled for one reason or another but Amazon actually had it and now I have it. Thank You Amazon 
 This book is so enjoyable!  The pictures are beautiful...just looking through it takes me back to my favorite place in the world! --Vicki Landes, author of "Europe For The Senses - A Photographic Journal 
 3 discs of music and with videos spanning the career of one of my favorite bands ever.  This features selections from all of their albums, concentrating on the first four records.  It also featues a few live and alternate tracks.  I obtained this when it was released in late 2003 to upgrade from 1992's Sand in the Vaseline 2 CD set, but superfans currently should consider the recently released Brick boxed set.  My only complaint lies with the highly disturbing artwork and awkward packaging.  
 Thermo is hard for two reasons. The equations are messy, and the properties are so abstract. Van Ness deals directly and only with the second problem.  His discussion of energy functions and energy transformations just as rules between observables is very helpful. Using that notion to get at what he means by a property and then making entropy understandable as a PROPERTY of a system is the core of much of the book. The derivation of some basic stuff in statistical mechanics is quite clear, and the logical relationship to classical thermo is very clear. An index would be nice 
 I would recommend that book to William Bouguereau estimator 
 This book is an excellent resource for any martial artist, be they a beginner or veteran . Using the many detailed illustrations provided in this book, you will be able to draw not only from the vast experience of the author, Mark Edward Cody, but also Ray Dionaldo, the Founder and Grand Master of Filipino Combat Systems (FCS). Through this book you will become acquainted with the amazing techniques of some of the most well known and highly sought after knife fighting instructors in the world. I really like that not only does the book cover the core concepts of FCS, basic martial principals, and the basics of self defense, but it also goes into more detail on the origin and fighting techniques of the Kerambit and the Sarong.  A very comprehensive book, a must read for anyone interested in knife fighting or martial arts 
 It is good and it has a lot of tips to be succesfull in your business. It is easy to read and understand and it has many web sites addreses 
 The main thing I liked about this book was it acurately represented what bellydance today is all about.  I would feel confident handing this book to a non-dancer and saying 'This should summarize it for you.' Our dance has so many stereotypes out there today, our community would greatly benefit if the misinformed read this book! It really is a collection of articles rather than a 'book' but it was divided up well and flowed nicely.  The costume section is written by Dina the Costume Goddess and if you have her books already its the same information contained in them, but even though I have her books I still enjoyed reading over it in a different format.  Plus it puts the information in one place as the information is snipets from several of her books (she currently has 6 out) There were a few sections I wish were longer, like the section on henna but I realize henna isn't belly dance specific and that each section deserved a book in its own right.  I've been dancing for 5 years and I still came across information that was new to me, or things I've only heard of were explained in detail such as the lives of the Egyptian dancers of the 'Golden Era'.  A very interesting and informative book.  Also has great pictures sprinkled throughout so its even nice to just flip through and look at those, though it would have been even better if they were in color of course.  I would say this book is a 'must have' for any dancers library 
 The previous review criticizes us for having a lengthy document reporting errata--but most of that document is not errata at all, but notes with extra material!  C.U.P. introduced 10 spots where some lines were lost in the 2nd printing; when that was discovered they withdrew the printing and filled all orders with the hardback first printing.  Perhaps "anonymous" would have been happier if we did not share the details of errors with readers, but we feel it is in the reader's interest to have the errata open to public 
 I am an obsessive travel planner and read every book I could find about the Big Island before going there. This book blew all the other books I read away. We stayed in Hilo for three days and primarily hiked around the volcano and everything (restaurants, scenic views, hikes, beaches, etc.) the book recommended was spot on. I felt like I had a tour guide with me the whole time I was on the Island and I know my vacation would not have been as enjoyable without this book. I also have been to Kauai and used the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook which is every bit as well written, informative, and useful as this Big Island book. If you think about all the time and money you spend to go to the Big Island and you don't spend the $15 and time to read this book before you go you are doing yourself a disservice 
 I bought copies of this book for both of my grown children and several other people who are important to me.  As an emergency department physician and a breeder of dogs and horses, I certainly concur with De Becker's point that humans are the only species who ignore or try to rationalize away gut feelings and instinctive fears.  In order to avoid embarrassing ourselves or someone else, someone who may be planning to do us harm, we step into an elevator (described as a sound-proof metal box) alone with someone who makes the hair on the backs of our necks quiver.  This book teaches important and valuable lessons.  I believe that more than a few people who read this book have saved themselves from harm by implementing its recommendations 
 This primer presents the topic of measures in plain language, explaing how measures give leaders leverage to create change and produce better results. I found this book very useful in explaining the fundamentals of good measures and giving a rationale for improving measures to my clients. Well done 
 Paul Fussell draws an exceedingly thin line between history and literary criticism in his telling how the Great War will endure modern memory from the British perspective. Fussell analyzes a vast array of poetry, memoirs, and prose-written both during and after the war-to convey the experiences and emotions of British officers and men who took part in such horrible battles as: the Somme, Ypres, and Passchendaele. Fussell illustrates how the basic elements of literature such as irony, metaphor, and myth appear throughout the literary works of Thomas Hardy, Seigfried Sassoon and Robert Graves to name a few. Fussell is not out to claim that truth is stranger than fiction, however. On the contrary, he argues that fiction closely parallels truth and, it is these literary devises that have ingrained the memory of the Great War into our consciousness. Many believe that the Great War sparked the advent of modernism, and that the lives of a whole generation of youth that came of age during that war was forever changed. Fussell attempts to prove that nowhere is this more apparent than in the British literature published in the years following World War I. Fussell chose primarily British literature for his study. This is not merely an attempt to narrow the focus of his study, but rather an Anglophilic obsession for the British classical literary tradition at the expense of other combatants; the French, Germans, and to a lesser degree, the Americans. Fussell levels a number of harsh criticisms at American writers, particularly Earnest Hemingway, claiming they existed in a literary vacuum "devoid of a Chaucer, a Spencer, a Shakespeare."  Fussell points out that, just prior to World War I, England had undergone a literary surge that had transcended existing class structures. Though organized reading groups at Workman's institutes and the Home Reading Union those of modest origins, it was hoped, would rise in class standing. According to Fussell, no effort was spared. Devouring the best the British had to offer, the author contends that the British population as a whole became "not merely literate but vigorously literary." Unfortunately, Fussell fails to mention the inclusion of women in this literary upsurge as well as barely mentioning women writers, if at all. Fussell analyzes and interprets the literature of the Great War with surgical precision. The author gives some fine examples of wartime poetry, especially the works of Seigfried Sassoon and Robert Graves. Fussell plays particular attention to the element of irony, its construction of themes and its influence on future generations of wartime writers. As Fussell points out, "the Great War was more ironic than any other in that its beginnings were more innocent." The British went to war in a gentlemanly and sporting manner even going so far as to kick a football as they advanced towards the enemy trenches. Fussell emphasizes the impact these seemingly insignificant events fuelled by irony have on one's memory, however, fails to present any evidence other than the literature itself. The point is that Fussell's strength lies in literary theory, not history. All too often, the author engages in broad generalizations when he steps out of his area of expertise (literary criticism). Yet this is one of the first works to apply literary criticism to an historical even, thus it enjoys classic status 
 I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY BROTHERS ROOM AS IT GETS COLD ON THOSE WINTER NIGHTS AND I DIDNT WANT HIM TO FREEZE GOT THIS HOPING IT WOULD AT LEAST MAKE IT MANAGABLE FOR HIM. BUT WE SOON FOUND OUT THIS HEAT KEEPS HIS ROOM SO WARM THAT YOU DONT EVEN NEED BLANKETS TO KEEP YOU WARM! HES VERY SATIFIED! HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL

 There are two things that are apt to happen upon reading The Colorado Kid, the latest outing by legendary horror writer Stephen King.  In fact, there are apt to be more than a few things that happen after reading the author's latest yarn, ayuh, and a fascinating yarn it is.  King remains an underrated contemporary master of storytelling and if there is any question as to whether his talent has waned over the years after producing nearly 50 novels, including the unforgettable Carrie, The Shining, Cujo and The Stand, that query is properly answered here.  What is often forgotten about King, despite the fact that he has singlehandedly changed and saved the direction of contemporary horror, is that sans horror he is an excellent storyteller.  In The Colorado Kid, King lends his talents to a line of hard case crime pulp fiction novels issued recently by Dorchester Publishing, which include other authors such as Richard Aleas (Little Girl Lost), Max Phillips (Fade to Blonde) and Wade Miller (Touch of Evil).  They are softcover dime store novel sized books your father probably carried in his coat pocket, and are designed to look like such with their Orbik drawn covers featuring sultry sirens and suspicious looking men in overcoats.  Kid is the story of two old newspapermen from Maine who spend one afternoon telling their intern about a mystery involving a man who was found dead on a beach back in 1980.  Nearly twenty-six years later the men tell the story in relish, but the more they explain to the inquisitive intern the less she understands.  What baffles both the intern and the reader is that nothing makes sense, including why the man was on the beach, where he was from, what he was doing in Maine, how he got to a remote region of Maine as quickly as he did, and last but not least, was he murdered.  	  The audience is apt to be confounded as King teases and rivets the reader to such an intriguing tale, all the while egging them on to solve the mystery before the end of the book.  With King's talent for relaying New England dialogue, the tale comes off as comfortably as a fireside ghost story, and the reader is likely not to get enough in turning this case six ways to Sunday in order to solve it.  What is also apt to happen is that the reader is likely to take issue with how the author resolves the matter, but that's neither here nor there as the issue is the mystery itself. 	 King's protagonists, Dave and Vince, are old fogeys we've seen in previous works by this author, in particular The Storm of the Century, and his ingenue Stephanie is a variation on his previous heroines.  All the same this short novel is a gem and King as comfortable and reliable as a favorite pair of shoes, taking us on a journey through not only an intriguing mystery but also once again the way of life of the New Englander, who keep secrets to themselves, say the word fair as fay-yuh, and the word ayuh as if a variation on the words Oh, yeah! 
 What a wonderful camera.  The photos come out sharp and clear.  The small size makes it very handy to carry around with you at all times.  The photos   load very quickly on to the computer.  For the price I would rate this a "best buy".  I found only one drawback which I feel is minor.  In very bright sunlight it is difficult to see the object on the screen unless it is shaded by a hand or a piece of paper or cardboard.  But this minor problem would not stop me from purchasing a second Coolpix L4.  You can purchase a 512 or l Meg memory card for very little money.  Check Amazon for Kingston or SanDisk.  I have both and they are great. 
 This DVD burner has exceeded my expectations. Additionally the price was right including a rebate offer with my effective price lower than some no-name brands 
 Good book for those followers of Christ who have been playing church or going through the motions with God.  An honest and opened heart toward God is needed in reading this book 
 I'm a huge fan of Jump5, but I think that they rushed the release of THE VERY BEST OF JUMP5. Most of these songs have been popular really recently, and throwing them all onto one CD with three new songs wasn't the best idea.  Highlights of THE VERY BEST OF JUMP5 are: *Spinnin' Around - The first Jump5 song I ever heard, and it's still one of my favorites. It's a catchy, bubbly pop song that can put anybody in a good mood. *Beauty and the Beast - From the original Disneymania CD. At first, I didn't like this song at all - how can you take a classic song like Beauty and the Beast and turn it into a funky, dance-pop song? After giving it another try, I realized that it's actually a pretty good cover. Sure, it's not like the original, but it's got a little "Jump5 spin" to it. *Beautiful to Me - One of the new songs on the CD, Beautiful to Me is one of my favorites. It has the newer, more mature sounding Jump5 on it, and I love it.   THE VERY BEST OF JUMP5 is a good CD, but I feel like it would have been a lot more memorable if it was released in a few years. The three new tracks are all pretty good, except for the song "Friends," which is a disappointment and is definately the worst song on the CD. Recommend to hardcore Jump5 fans, but that's about it. 
 Yes, it's basic but that is the point. Most people are afraid of reading charts and this explains it in very easy to read charts and simple language. I was very impressed with the ease of use of the book. I have been a trader for many years but this book explained it in very simple terms and great exercises to practice on. I will buy this book for my friends who would like to learn more but are intimidated with the overload of TA information. 
 Would recommend to friends solely for the entrancing, heart-rending solo by violinest (er, sorry, 'fiddler') Mike Myers. This Applachian-style melody is equally elusive and unforgettable in its haunted wandering. All the tracks are at least interesting and follow the strong Williams theme well, though its rather intense for casual listening. It is from an action-movie, after all.. 
 The book I read was called freedom train. It was about harriet tubman trying to escape. An one day she found a tunnel that lead to Canada. Happy as she was she went to tell everyone. and they were free!and also this book made me feel I could do something too. Because when she caped on saying I can do it!And she never gave up!I will reccomand this to my friends because I hope they will enjoy the things she did,And feel the same way I felt 
 I am still reading this book but so far I really love it. John Densmore is a really good writer for some one who is not a writer. Many musicians cannot write books let alone one this personal. I love how this book dispells some of the issues brought up in the movie "The Doors" like  John, Robby and Ray all lived with Jim at some point during their career and they were friends. Very Good So far cannot wait to finish it.  
 Film scholar and critic Neal Gabler offers a surprisingly well-researched, academically sound, and insightful study of the scions of early Hollywood and their vision for America. Ironically, and somewhat paradoxically, he finds that the early movie industry was largely founded by Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. As outsiders in WASPish America, they nonetheless excelled at creating a vision of the United States that incorporated some of its most cherished principles and desires. Such studio executives as Louis B. Mayer, Harry Cohn, and the Warner brothers ensconced a vision of America at its best that stood far removed from the reality of their lives.   As Gabler wrote of these industry leaders: "What united them in deep spiritual kinship was their utter and absolute rejection of their pasts and their equally absolute devotion to their new country....something drove the young Hollywood Jews to a ferocious, even pathological, embrace of America. Something drove them to deny whatever they had been before settling here" (p. 4). Gabler believes that these Jewish leaders "colonized the American imagination" (p. 7). Over time, their films embodied American values; the irony is that they were made by people alienated from that culture. As Gabler concludes, "the Jews reinvented the country in the image of their fiction" (p. 7).  This is a very interesting and useful study of the role of film in defining the American character in the early twentieth century. 
 What can one say? The freedom with which the author grants the reader not just a glimpse but a fully engrossing view of her world, is justifiably prize-winning. Madam Graham's troubles and triumphs give the student of the publishing world, of motherhood, wifehood, of power or of politics endless lessons.  I would recommend reading this book along with Janet Langhart Cohen's Book "From Rage to Reason".  These two women were both friends and are powerful examples of republican women who rock (to use the venacular popular with youth these days!).  Both of these women give a wondrous example of how to balance a commitment to family and traditional values with leadership and power.  I do hope whomever reads both books gets much out of the experience and finds this review of use 
 Take this to the beach or your favorite vacation spot (even out to the yard in the hammock).  A very sweet book 
 This book is touching, heart-breaking and most of all, realistic. I could not help but thinking how would I feel if, as a little girl, I would have been torn away from my culture and my recently-deceased parents' world to live with relatives in an unknown, mysterious place on the other side of the planet. That is how much impact the book has-- you feel the pain, love and feelings constrained by cultural norms that every character is burdened by.  What is wrong and what is right takes many different meanings.  The book makes you reconsider values that are culturally accepted but that go against the human spirit.  How hearbreaking it must be for a parent to cut all ties with a beloved child because of a marriage against his/her wishes?  As a reader, you can't stop thinking about that either 
 pure joy , real klezmer !!!!! 
 As a graduate of a medieval studies program specializing in Irish literature, I am prompted to write this review to let people know how thrilled I am to have come across a book that contributes so much to our understanding of Celtic spirituality and how to apply its teachings in a modern context. Far from being "new-agey" this book is head and shoulders above the usual Wiccan and pagan-based junk that passes for "Celtic." "Kindling the Celtic Spirit" is lucidly written, honest about what we know and what we don't know about the Celts, inspiring, and above all, offers an accessible introduction to many of the key aspects of Celtic mythology and spirituality - I particularly loved the sections about music and animals, the chapter on tree-lore and the many marvelous recipes! The author really knows her stuff and is an exceptionally lyrical writer of a caliber not to be found in most popular books on the market today. It's definitely a book to keep or to give to friends to get them hopelessly addicted to the beauty of Celtica 
 Loved this movie and can definitely see why it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animation! I honestly thought it should have won for Best Animation, but oh well!!   This movie has a great storyline, is fast paced and entertaining to say the least. I think it may be fairly scary for those under 7 years old though, but otherwise a great film 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  I am not going to tell you the whole movie such like I have already read since this is a review not a summary.  Tangled is a perfect name for this movie, because it describes all three charecters' feelings and paths.  I don't think it is made to leave you lost, I think it is made to leave you surprised.  It's a love story, a thriller, and a triangular pretzel 
 This book is fantastic.  I've had it for years and just re-discovered it.  It's essential for any far side fan because it's more than just a compilation.  I think it may even be a good introduction if you're just learning about the far side from the calendar (since the panel strip isn't in circulation anymore).  If you'd like to own one book but aren't sure which to buy or where to start, start with this 
 good phot 
 Some 15 years ago, I bought the 54 volume version of the great books of the western civilization -and spent ten years reading them (aside from making a living and raising two children). These books have affected my life in various ways, all very positive I believe. If my comment can at least encourage one person in the world to go ahead and read this extraordinary collection, I would be very happy. The publishers have been wise in avoiding footnotes and erudite biographical notes, and of course, in the selection of the works. R Roose from Mexico Cit 
 And from the first day I haven't stopped learning from it. I have gone over the games time and time again, and I am still simply blown away by both the games and the annotations. I gained around 200 points over all from studying this book 
 Searching through a bookstore in London looking for something to read during my three months of studying abroad, I came across this novel.  Although there is a different cover on my copy something about the blurb on the back caught my attention.  Compelled to buy the novel I did and began to read it right away.  It only took me 3 days to get through it because I could not put it down.  Although it is a little odd at times trying to wrap your mind around such a complicated premise, there is nothing complicated about the feelings and the representation of human nature.  This book is moving and many times throughout it I shed a tear for the tormented Max Tivoli.  It's almost like the expression, "If I knew then what I knew now..."  Max going backwards through his life has an opportunity to almost "re-do" his life as he goes, yet human nature gets in the way and the heart conquers the mind.  This novel is now one of my favorite novels and I suggest all of you read it, espcially if you know what is feels like to "have loved and lost".  
 When my daughter was 5 weeks old, I was long desperate for ways to calm her and help her fall asleep. In her third week, it felt like everything fell apart, and my meagre attempts to console her and help her get to sleep were getting weirder and more desperate. I used hair dryers, sitting on an exercise ball and bouncing vigorous up and down with her in my arms, and these would get me maybe 20 to 30 minutes of calm and sleep. A friend suggested the Happiest Baby DVD, and our lives changed! I watched the DVD four times through and cried tears of joy through the first two viewings--meanwhile practicing the techniques with her.   She's sleeping far better, and I am too - and I feel so much more calmer and confident myself knowing that I can soothe her when she needs it. I now tell all my pregnant friends about this. I really wish I had known about the 5 S's before she was born. Thank you from the happiest mommy on the planet 
 I am a REALTOR and I give this book to every person who buys a home from me.  I figure the day of closing is the best time to start keeping a record of the home and anything done to it.  The only thing I don't like is that the original book I bought is spiral bound (I like that!) and the recent ones I have purchased are not spiral, but no matter, I still buy the book and my clients seem to apprecite them 
 A wonderful classic musical with exquisite costumes. Can't get enough of the karaoke within the movie and the "songs only" options 
 The addition of Ralph Steadman's artwork added a new depth to this classic story. This is a beautifully illustrated edition I would highly recommend for fans of the origianl story as well as those who have never read it before 
 I've been looking for over 2 years to replace a similar product I had.  This is much better, sturdier, and heats great 
 This product will save you money and the lemon flavor really does take alot of the fish taste off.  Mixed with extra virgin olive oil it makes a nice Greek dressing to salad.  It appears to be a high quality oil also 
 My best friend and I decided to start reading again,(neither one of us big readers).  I saw these books on the best seller table, thought the covers were pretty and figured I had as much of a chance of liking these books as any other.  I read the first paragraph of SOMETHING BORROWED and immediately called my friend and told her I had struck gold!!  I read her the 1st couple of paragraphs and she went crazy over the book as I did.  We can't read these books fast enough! Especially if you are in your 30's, the 80's references, and the way the charcters speak makes you identify with them and you will feel like they have been friends you've known for years.  I started telling everyone how much I was enjoying reading again and my sister-in-law said she had a great reccomendation for me and it turned out to be SOMETHING BORROWED!  Now I have friends and family joining in and everyone is loving these books!  Hope you do too 
 My two-year-old daughter loves this book. Her preschool recommended it, and when I first saw it, I thought she might be frightened by it.  Not the case.  She loves reading it at night before bed, and she talks about it during the day.  It teaches a great concept:  Mommy comes back.  It's and easy read with repetition (which kids love), and the illustrations are different than most children's books.  She loves looking at the "owl babies" and especially loves the drawings of the Mother Owl.  I highly recommend this book for your toddler and/or preschooler!  
 This winter is no invention or exaggeration, it took place, just as Laura described. In this freakishly hard winter a "hundred year's winter" the family lives in town and twists staw to burn for warmth. The trains canot reach town, so there is no meat, no fuel, no supplies of any nature coming in. The settlers in DeSmet, South Dakota, as across thousands of square miles of the US heartland, are on their own. Page after page of grueling hardship is carefully related by Laura, still obviously moved by her plight even at a lifetime's distance from this disaster. The highpoint of this novel comes when Almanzo Wilder and another local young man called Cap Garland make a daring trek across the plains to try to reach a rumored source of wheat, and return with it before before the next blizzard comes. For them to be stuck on the prairie during a blizzard is a sure death sentence. Few  obstacles to human proposerity exist in this world greater than the grip of a hard winter. There is a feel here in this book of being under seige, and the winter is itself somewhat suggestive of a foreign army enclosing the people of Laura's circle, and threatening their sanity, well-being, and their very lives 
 The author writes well, but rarely have I read a book that left so many  "untied" loose ends.  There were many hints throughout the book  as to who the bad guy/gal was, but most of these hints were never resolved  one way or another.  Unless I missed something?  For example, what was the  deal with "the mole"?  They mentioned it several times and then .  . . nothing!  And what about Pete Carlson?  Did he spill the beans about  Joy and Bill at the convention?  Did he remain as anchor or did Yelena  finally get rid of him?  And what about the homeless guy stealing the  animal doorknockers??  Can someone please tell me how that fit in with the  rest of the book?  Or did it?  Were all of these simply "red  herrings," or did the whole plot just go right over my head?  (I  sincerely would like someone to explain this book to me - I'm not kidding. 
 Greg Iles writes the type of book that is hard to put down.  This can sometimes be problematic as his books are also generally long.  Still he's an amazing storyteller.  His characters are well formed with many dimensions and often have both endearing and distasteful characteristics.    Audio versions of The Quiet Game can be found read by either Tom Stechsculte or Dick Hill.  Both are great narrators, although I would rate Stechsculte higher.  He really brings books with deep characters and intense story lines to life 
 As a veteran of both the United States Army (field artillery) and militia (National Guard), Professor Fischer's story makes one proud to have served in the same army as George Washington and those brave men who tramped through the snow and freezing rain 
 I thoroughly enjoyed Espresso Tales, Alexander McCall Smith's followup to 44 Scotland Street...and I can't wait to read the next book in the series, which he is now writing.  I thought 44 Scotland Street was weakened a little by the sheer number of characters, but here the focus seemed tighter. We get to reunite with Bertie, the boy genius who just wants to be a regular kid; Bruce, the indefatigable narcissist; Pat, the understated gallery worker/college student; Matthew, who has now made a profit at the gallery, and has his gentle eye on Pat; Domenica, the sharp-tongued elderly woman who may be a porteparole for McCall Smith himself; and Angus, the eccentric painter whose dog, Cyril, gets a charming chapter of his own.  Everything that happened to these characters just seemed right, and it was such an enjoyable ride 
 My now 3 1/2 yr old son began watching this version on HBO in Demand and loved it. It was the only thing he asked to watch over and over. It has not been available for the past month on In Demand so we went to the library and borrowed the original (1974 I think) Scholastic version. My son enjoyed it just as much as the Sharon Stone-narrated version. Both versions stimulate the creative mind and I feel that these series are overall so much better than much of the programming available for the preschool set. Overall a wonderful purchase....only one episode I had a hard time with (when Harold's pet fish dies) as it was too much for my son to understand and too much for me to stay dry-eyed due to the recent death of our dog! 
 What's not to like? Three hundred pages of your favorite trash, elevated to nostalgia, handily packaged, and punchily, pithily, wittily written. Makes a great gift! (see "Infomercials" 
 this soundtrack is awesome and i especially like the Brian Eno song at the end.  great soundtrack for a great film 
 I have yet to find a weak recipe in this cookbook and have used it nightly for several weeks. The recipes are straightforward to follow, use fresh ingredients, and yield excellent results. Highly recommended for any busy person who loves really good food 
 One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich was a good and short read. (The book is only 159 pages.) Solzhenitsyn does not break the book into chapters, but rather combines the book into one single narrative. (This can make finding stopping points in your reading difficult.) The entire book takes place during one January day. The book centers around the life of Ivan Denisovich Shukhov and his fellow prisoners at a Stalinist work prison in Siberia. Solzhenitsyn rarely mentions the prison guards by name in the book. This emphasises the lives of the individual prisoners. Unlike like many other famous Russian novels, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, is mainly about the Russian underclass. The unchecked power, unfairness, randomness, and ineffectiveness of Soviet Union is constant theme in the book. The most memorable scene from the book, is where the uneducated Shukvo asks if the Soviet government has the power to change the sun's highest point in the sky from noon to one o'clock.   
 You'll find practical advise in clear and direct language.  Highly recommended.  Don't wait to read this book - if you want to stay yourself AND get what you want out of life.  As quoted on page 54: "Human nature will not change" (Abraham Lincoln).  Learn how to change your negotiating style, or adopt one in the first place. Wonderfully simple presentation of "Active Listening" 
 This how-to-write poetry text is good to begin with and good to grow with.  Each chapter is followed by a brief but diverse selection of poems that illustrate the principles discussed in the chapter.  Suggested assignments are provided at levels one, two, and three so that students can work through the book three times at increasing levels of sophistication. My sophomore creative writing poetry students begin with this text 
 I have sat several meditation retreats with the author, so I came to this book having already encountered many of these techniques and ideas in a practical setting. While there is no substitute for person-to-person instruction, you can get pretty close with this book/CD.  A warning: if you are looking for the sort of pseudo-Kabbalah being peddled by Rav Berg and the Kabbalah Center, this book is not for you. There is no bottled water here, no red threads or other magical nonsense, nothing to appeal to the Madonna-wannabes. Real Kabbalah is invisible on the outside. There are no fashion statements or other ready-to-wear "spiritual materialist" baloney.   Real Kabbalah is all about quieting down the constant internal monologue so that we can learn to see the Divine in all Its manifestations. Once you get tired of the pop-culture distortions so prevalent today, take off that silly red thread, dump the bottled water onto the begonias, and crack this book. Sit on a chair (or a zafu if you prefer), and try these meditations. You'll gain more self-awareness and God-awareness from one hour of clear mindedness than from a hundred thousand miles of red string. 
 This is a powerful, well-written book, but I think it tells us a lot more about Mr. Bloom than it does about the contemporary (or at least 1980s) university system.  Bloom decries the fact that American college students (possibly, he thinks, because of a problem with secondary education) no longer have heroes or wrestle with the Great Books or think critically about politics or each other.  He holds up European students as a possible paradigm--with their own problems, of course, but more firmly culturally situated than Americans.  My problem is not with these assertions, but with the subtle "no longer" attached to them, as if everyone used to have the same experiences Mr. Bloom had and now doesn't anymore.  When was the golden age of the American university?  The 1950s?  The 1920s?  The 1850s?  Mr. Bloom's own experience--he entered the University of Chicago at the age of 15 and studied under giants like Leo Strauss and Richard McKeon--is so atypical as to blind him to other realities of the university experience.  He decries the push for formal training, brilliantly stating that if that's all college is for, no one needs four years; but again, that subtle "no longer" is attached.    He also gets some facts plain wrong.  He says that nearly everyone in the middle-class has a college degree; this just isn't the case, as the overall percentage of Americans with college degrees is now, in 2006, 18 years later, around 28%.  He also says that every student these days is a relativist to some degree, and while there may be a greater preponderance of relativists in the elite universities Mr. Bloom is used to, this doesn't count the hundreds of thousands of students at Christian colleges, in public universities, and in specialized and technical schools.  His grasp of philosophy and the relationship between ideologies and ideas is spectacular; the book is gripping and poetic and a great read.  But his arguments could have been much more narrow and thus much more powerful 
 The book is brief, the language is simple, and the best of all...it works.  This handy, and concise book will teach you how to manage your life (Not only your Work!!), and thus reduce your stress, simplify your life, and get the work done in less time.  What you will find in this book is an easy to read story, that quickly teaches you three very successful and practical management techniques: One Minute Goals Setting, One Minute Praising, and One Minute Reprisals.  Its story format makes this book readable and light,.. but yet very insightful and effective. You will want to read this book over and over, just for the pleasure of doing it. I bought this book 13 years ago, and I still enjoy reading it 
 I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this novel, and what can I say? I loved it. I've never read anything before by this author, but the narration, the spinechilling series of events and the loveable characters made me want to read more. I sincerely hope there is a sequel.   The story involves an ancient curse placed upon a woman's family which is unwittingly unleashed by her likeable teenage son, Cory. Cory's family must bear the brunt of a demon's tricks and wrath, which does at times have fatal consequences.    I particularly liked Shawn/Cory, Naomi and Onyx. I really do feel taht Tananarive can write excellent male characters. Her male characters seem very realistic and heartfelt.  5 stars 
 Marc Steyn is a Brit transplanted to New Hampshire who writes mostly political commentary for papers in Chicago, London, and Canada plus columns for National Review, but this volume harkens back to his days as a theater critic and historian to give us a complete, though opinionated, picture of the history of the musical theater--first on Broadway and then in London. His writing is full of puns and wit, but more importantly, the stories he tells and the quotes from every major figure ranging from Lerner & Lowe to Andrew Lloyd Webber put the whole mysterious world of how musicals are born, rehearsed, and then live or die into perspective that both the outsider looking in and the theatrical professional can appreciate. He also uses his knowledge of history to put shows and their popularity into the context of their times--for example sharing the fact that literally hundreds of shows in the immediate post-Civil War period dealt with ghosts and spirits because the strong belief in an afterlife gave the nation a spiritual soothing after the horrors of massive death in the war itself. He covers the songwriters, the book writers, the hits, the flops, the stars---even the whole CONCEPT of a "star" and how it has changed over the years--and you will be entertained and enlightened indeed.  This is a book perfect for a gift for anyone you know who loves theater, music, or hopes to be a part of the professional world of it or is already. It isn't exactly a tale with a happy ending--the current state of the musical is pretty grim in many ways Steyn elaborates on--but it does point out the way "home" to real successes in the future, too.  From obscure historical stuff you'd never find anywhere else to major "name" showbiz stars and their gossip, "Broadway Babies Say Goodnight" is a superb read for the theater fan 
 I've been a fan of Heather Pringle ever since I picked up The Mummy Congress and spent an entire day in Acapulco in my room reading it in preference to splashing about in the Pacific.  This book is, of course, entirely different and concerns the efforts of Heinrich Himmler to establish a anthropologic/historical "school" called the Ahnenerbe to indoctrinate young Nazis by advancing the theory of the "master race" and tracking the history of advanced civilizations back to thier presumed Aryan ancestors.   While Himmler's efforts were in themselves crackpot and gathered quite a few kooks along the way such as his assistant, former mental patient named Karl-Marial Wilgigut who traced his family back to the Norse god Thor, more interestingly is that many of the reputable German scientists of the day followed along either through fear of political censorship or quite possibley through shared beliefs.    Throughout, Ms. Pringle pops up with interesting facts such as Hugo Boss' supplying of the Nazi uniforms and Ludwig Roselius' invention of decaffeinated coffee (sufficient reason in itself to dislike the Nazis.)  This book is well worth the price particularly as it presents the acceptance of craziness and promulgation of insanity in modern civilization and deals with an area of the Third Reich which would otherwise be unfamiliar to most readers.  Highly recommended. 
 This is an excellent CD from one of the pioneers of bossa nova. Every song is light and airy and the guitar work is absolutely beautiful. Try to get your hands on a used copy if possible so you can experience this CD 
 We had Irma's old Joy of Cooking until it fell apart.We  bought what we thought was a reprint of it several years ago.It was not! I came across the reprint edition on the web and bought it.WE are pleased to get a meaningful cookbook back                      Chet Bentley 
 My seven-yr-old requested this CD after hearing it at a friends house.  It is a fabulous CD to be listened to anytime of year.  The songs are funny and are easy to sing to.  Highly recommended by this mom 
 This is the ultimate magazine for mystery readers and mystery writers. From front cover to back, it's full of the information you need to know about new books, favorite authors, and what's going on in the mystery business 
 I am a Certified HypnoBirthing® Childbirth Educator and I am sharing this with every person I know personally and every couple I come into contact professionally. I look forward to sharing it with my young daughter someday 10 years from now [hopefully Dr. Travis & Ms. Ryan will write future editions too]! I ate up each and every page, looking forward to the next. Plus it was easy to read and the index was so detailed that I could locate specific concerns quickly as if Dr. Travis was personally answering my inquiry. I loved the personal pictures from the authors' childhood and the last page [Grand Certificate] deserves to be on everyone's wall. If more parents followed the information in this book, the result would be lots of happier children, better balanced and less angry teenagers and less violent and money/status starved adults in our world. I know I will be referring to my copy for years to come ...or until the cover falls off! Perhaps by then the 4th edition will be birthed. I'm also planning to give copies as gifts since what it better but the gift of health 
 We read this book after Brown Bear and Polar Bear and about the same time as Hungry Caterpillar.  While my 2 1/2 year old son, Brian, loves all of  his Eric Carle books, he's particularly taken with this mixed-up chameleon.   From the first page, there are already new concepts to grasp, such as  seeing the chameleon turn "brownish" after it moved onto a  "brown" tree, "reddish" on a "red" flower,  and "yellowish" on the "yellow" sand.  That's just Page  1.  Subsequently, Brian would then read out loud, how "I wish I could  be HANDSOME like a flamingo,"..."smart like a  fox",..."funny like a seal" at which point he'll go  "hahahahaha".  He's only had the book for 3 weeks and he's  already "reading" almost the whole book by himself.  The story  has a moral to it too, about how the chameleon, after wishing to be all the  things it wasn't, ended up so mixed-up that it finally wished "I could  be myself."  We have great fun reading about the chameleon together,  as we do about the other Eric Carle characters: hungry caterpillar, brown  bear, polar bear, and little cloud 
 A quick read that is filled with timeless advice from a legend in the shooting world.  Although the focus is entirely on revolvers, many of the techniques and training methods can apply to semi-automatic pistols.  A proponent of dry fire practice and learning basic marksmanship before attempting more advanced skills (i.e. drawing from a holster).  Even in today's world of fast and fancy equipment and training his standards were extremely high as expressed in this quote regarding law enforcement officers:  "Until he can draw and get his hit in times shading one half second, he should not presume that he has mastered the handgun."   "Speed's fine but accuracy's final" 
 So it's old. So it's a little smarmy. So there are sample pitch letters about how "by 1990, it's believed that many Americans will have computers." So a lot of people have moved on to selling stories with sloppy little e-mail notes. So what.  Lisa Collier Cool teaches you to cross all the 'T's to give your pitch letter unstoppable propulsion. You might read her method and say, 'that's overkill.' But unless you've got a better idea (such as phoning up your old Ivy League buddies for an assignment) this is what you want for breaking in to a magazine on the strength of raw ideas, not schmoozy contacts.  If it wasn't for this book I'd probably be in law school right now 
 what more can you say its ELVIS singing the best Christmas songs only like ELVIS can..... 
 In a sense, Shakespeare treaded on Gothic elements in his play Macbeth, which premiered after Queen Elizabeth had died and King James, who had heritage in Scotland, became the new King of England. James knew about his infamous ancestor Macbeth and commissioned the Bard to write a thrilling work of theatre which recounted the historic tale of Macbeth. There really was a Macbeth, but much of the story is fictional, save for the names of people and places. Macbeth is Shakespeare's darkest tragedy. On the New Folgers Library Edition, we are treated to the very best of scholarly information regarding the creation of the play, and the political and theatrical world of Shakespeare's day. This is the best printed version of Macbeth you will find today. And for this reader, it is a play perfect for this Halloween season. The plot, without giving much of it away in a summary, is quite simple but powerful in its impact. In Medieval England, the minor nobleman Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth plot to murder the current king of Scotland. Their ambitions are spurred when three mysterious witches foretell their success. However, as Macbeth maintains power, he becomes fearful of losing it. He orders the deaths of allies and friends out of insecurity. Eventually his own ambition becomes his downfall and a new king arises. Since its premiere, Macbeth has been rumored to be "cursed". Throughout the years, including the twentieth century, reports of accidents and even deaths have circulated involving certain productions of Macbeth. The elements in the play are dark and quintessentially Gothic- flying daggers, constant darkness and fog, ghosts, witches, apparitions including dead kings and bloody children. In the 19th century this would encompass the material of Gothic literature but in Shakespeare's time it was part of thrilling drama. Supernatural beings like ghosts were featured in other Shakespeare tragedies -Hamlet and Julius Caesar for instance. The belief in witches was prevalent in Puritan/Protestant/Catholic England, after all this was still the time of the Inquisition. So the featured Three Witches would have actually been regarded as a true part of history even. This play has many fine moments. All of Macbeth's quotes are memorable but especially his "Out, Out Brief Candle! Life is but a walking shadow..." The role of Lady Macbeth, if played well, can be the signature role of many actresses. She is Shakespeare's most evil creations. She drives Macbeth to murder because she is perhaps even more ambitious than him. Her being a female is her only setback. But she is an empowered and vile woman, even regarded as something of a witch herself. The play inspired several film versions including director Roman Polanski's version in 1971 and in the 19th century an opera by Verdi. 
  One would think that after writing five completely charming novels about the despair of three orphans, Lemony Snicket would have trouble writing another novel that lives up to the creativeness, randomness, and humor of it's predecessors.  One would be wrong.  Snicket's writing is strong and hilarious as always-- it's the plot that makes this one sometimes drag.  While the story is mostly interesting, hearing about the Baudelaires climbing an endless flight of steps gets old after a while.  This is a small flaw in the story, and the rest of the novel is very strong.  It can be said that a writer who creates a character then readers hate and want to physically shake is a good writer, and this is what Snicket does when he creates the character of Esme, a new guardian of our favorite orphans, who only cares about things that are "in."  This story has many literally strong points that the previous novels in this series do not, such as 1. a red herring (a literal AND a figurative) 2. a huge element of surprise 3. heightened suspense 4. this book gives you a lot of information on certain things, but also leaves you with more questions.  This technique is often done by J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, and is a big reason for the series' success.  Readers will surely want to come back to have their questions answered, and with "The Ersatz Elevator," Mr. Snicket had undoubtedly secured a returning audience.  If all of the above doesn't convince you to read this sixth volume in A Series of Unfortunate Events, know this: reading Snicket's fun and informative narration will improve your vocabulary!  7/10 
 Telling to Live fills the void by sharing the "testimonios" of the various Latina feminist writers in the book. The testimonios are poignant and at times hilarious.   I used this book in an upper division course and by and large the students liked the book. The Latina/o students were extremely fond of the book and it caused self-reflection on their part.   I own the book and have read it twice and know that I will continue to go back for the book for personal and acadmic reasons. 
 I have made many of the recipes from this book and have enjoyed the results of my efforts.  Ms. Wolfert is a recognized expert on the cooking of the region, and as such could have used her status to impart her experiences with the culture as well as the food.  One book which does this beyond compare is the book by Sonia Uvezian: A culinary journey through Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan which is now unfortunately unavailable.   Kudos to Ms. Wolfert for including sources for hard-to-find ingredients at the end of the book 
 W.H. Auden was, of course, one of the 20th Century's greatest poets. This collection of essays, forewards and reviews illuminates his carefully thought out positions on poetry, literature, art, artists and religion. The book covers a period of over thirty years and the organization of the book is not chronological. Though this obscures the development of Auden's thoughts over time, it does serve as a useful almost biographical device. Beginning with the most esoteric discussions of Christian mysticism, the editor proceeds to go deeper and deeper into Auden himself, until he ends with a semi-autobiograhical account.  Read in conjunction with the poetry, one feels sometimes that the poems do illustrate the philosophy more clearly than the prose, but notwithstanding, these essays are well worth reading. The essays on Goethe and Wagner are arresting insights about the relationship between the artist and his life that might startle those used to the conventional view of art derives from life. The format leads inevitably to repetition but the repetition is welcome as the concepts are often difficult and benefit from being brought forth in different contexts 
 This book is for experienced SQL developers. No fancy stuff. I found it very useful, since you will find lot of material you won't find anywhere else. It can be a good source for those who tries to handle SQL Server administration by not using Enterprise manager (such doing a backup, reindexing databases etc.). But in any case it's a very good addition to your library. Great job by Ken Anderson 
 This book is such a wonderful find for any peanuts fan. A wonderful book by a wonderful person, Rheta Johnson. I look forward to any other books by her that may be published in the future.. 
 I FOUND THIS BOOK ABOUT ANGELINA TO BE A GOOD READ. IT IS SHORT AND SWEET, EASY TO READ. IT COVERS HER LIFE AND CAREER IN GENERAL WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF DETAIL. IF YOU LIKE TO READ ABOUT THE MOVIES SHE HAS MADE AND A BIT ABOUT HER PRIVATE LIFE, THEN THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. IT HAS MANY PICS AND IS A NICE KEEPSAKE IF YOU ENJOY THIS GORGEOUS AND TALENTED ACTRESS. A NICE BUY 
 I am a big fan of 2002, and have 7 of their albums. I can say that The Emerald Way is not their best work, but it still is pretty good.  It is just that I like their other albums better, namely Chrysalis, River of Stars, This Moment Now, Land of Forever, and Across an Ocean of Dreams.  One thing that they did different on this album is they have pronounced vocal effects on the voice on track 3.  It works.  I have given the album 5 stars instead of 4 because even when 2002 is not at their best they still manage to create wonderful music.  If you have their other albums and want even more 2002, it would be safe to explore this album 
 What does the mention of "nature" bring to mind? Nurturing and providing, or competitive and indifferent? Known and measured, or mysterious and chaotic? Pure and clean, or pestilential? In his book, Infinite Nature, Dr. R. Bruce Hull challenges us to choose.  Dr. Hull begins by introducing the concept of environmental fundamentalism. In his view, assuming a fundamentalist stance risks a narrowed perception, restricting the safe space where common interests can coexist. In taking a fundamentalist view, we may miss the larger texture of existence, or worse, dismiss those issues we fear and therefore fail to deal with them effectively. Dispassionate and fearless investigation could confirm and strengthen our views; it could enlarge them, or cause them to change.   However, if one embraces the concept of environmental pluralism, the notion arises that all participants in the science, spirit, politics and industry of "nature" can gather together cooperatively at the world's table. The planet being what it is - not a banquet of limitless supply - we must investigate all fact and all opinion, or risk missing essential information that could forestall a more difficult future for ourselves and our offspring.   Dr. Hull suggests "many natures and many lessons to learn from them," and he has titled his chapters, to cite a few: "Evolving Nature," "Rightful Nature," "Aesthetic Nature," "Moral Nature." These chapters contain various reflections about the price of a life, environmental racism, recreation, forestry, history, faith, health, and work.  As a series of chapters containing individual essays, the book lends itself well to small-bite reading. Open it anywhere; each chapter grabs the reader's interest immediately. It's a book that's easy to keep coming back to. It inspires one to think, to learn something new and to be driven to learn more.   Infinite Nature is not a macabre reflection on a future-less Malthusian world, but it does encourage us to ask why humanity often fails to respond in the face of obvious environmental catastrophe: we may distrust the message or the messenger; we may be so pessimistic as to believe that nothing can be done; our political or religious beliefs may indicate we need do nothing; we just might be too tired to act. Any such reasons might be legitimate, but Dr. Hull asks us to confront these controlling factors with an open mind and heart in order to answer the question: "What kind of world do I want to live in?"  While Dr. Hull unabashedly reveals his deep love of the natural world, there is a refreshing lack of preaching and moralizing within the book's covers. Infinite Nature insists that we make our own investigations and draw our own conclusions. Dr. Hull not only provides us with an entertaining and informative read, but also provokes us to ponder, and delight in, our place in the world.

 Anti-Sicilians for Black by GM Dorian Rogozenko is exactly what the title claims;a Black repertoire vs anything but open Sicilians. Specifically,the chapter headings are:Early Deviations (2.c4,2.b4,2.b3,2.d3,2.g3,2.d4),Grand Prix Attack,Closed Sicilian,Alapin,"Misc Lines after 2.Nf3",3.Bb5(+),and 2.Nf3,d6 3.d4,cxd4,4.Qxd4.  I very much admire this book for both the completness and explanations provided by GM Rogozenko. As pointed out in the Intro,Rogozenko is himself a lifelong Sicilian player,and I think it shows. Rogozenko's consistent attitude,carefully threatened in the Introduction and referred to throughout, is to present solid,objectively equal lines for Black.By good luck for me,this is just the approach that appeals. But of course,it won't be to everyone's taste.  Foe example, regarding attempts to play the Morra gambit,Rogozenko "merely" recommends 2...Nf6 and transpose to the Alapin. A very pragmatic approach,given that to prepare for the Morra would be a lot of work for a very rare opening,plus the fact that the 2...Nf6 Alapin is completely acceptable for Black. But others might wish for a more combative attitude.  Rogozenko provides both a solid (early ...e6) and a more contentious approach to the Alapin,but in general the lines are main line with an eye to simplification and solidity.  A big plus to the book,in my opinion, is that Rogozenko is very careful to delineate recommendations according to one's Open Sicilian preference (2...e6 vs 2...d6 vs 2...Nc6). Thus all Sicilian players are provided with a repertoire that is easy to find.  And in my opinion the book is suitable for a very wide range of levels,as Rogozenko recommends mostly GM main lines, but consistently inserts refutations of plausible mistakes that lesser players are liable to make.  Rogozenko's style is what one might call fatherly and encouraging, and the prose is informative and not filler. For an opening book, there is very little of the mysterious "and Black is clearly better" etc. that irritates a club player like myself. Altho without complete games (customary for a Gambit book), Rogozenko ably lays out the plans for the remainder at the end of the variations. Exceptionally clearly,in my opinion.  In summary,I truly believe one could successfully prepare vs Anti-Silians with this single volume,and enjoy doing so. I congratulate GM Rogozenko on his contribution and look forward to future efforts 
 Dark Prince is the tale of Mikhail and Raven, just your average Carpathian and the fragile telepath he becomes involved with.  The beginning of this book absolutely reaches out and grabs you, delving into mental telepathy between the two characters.  I enjoyed the flirting and foreplay but I have to say Raven becomes weak after the first chapter of this book and the male macho syndrome barrels in.  Yes I realize these vampires are supposed to be hundreds of years old and middle-European males but I want a little more backbone in my females.  Having said that, it's one of the best of the 'tender vampire love stories' versus the radical and somewhat gruesome genre that has taken over.  If you want ALOT and I mean ALOT of sexual contact between characters (full of vivid description) then you will like this novel.  The Carpathians are an interesting lot---they're our tall, dark, vampires the way we'd like them to be...they don't kill anybody without good reason and fine women are the only thing that saves their mental well being.  Alot like being married!  
 I read "Back When We Were Grown-Ups" a few months back and did not enjoy the novel much.  I found the characters to be boring and annoying and the theme pointless.  But I loved the tone Anne Tyler writes in.  It's somehow so calming and lyrical so I decided to take another stab with Anne Tyler's "Saint Maybe." And I am so happy I did.  Not only did I get to once again experience Tyler's great writing style, but I cared about the characters and was interested in the plot.  I especially enjoyed the earlier part of the novel.  Did anyone else love the funny yet sad scene when Agatha tried to clean Daphne's diaper and ending up breaking the tiolet?  Or when Thomas was trying to remember their old life in the trailer and thought the best way to find their old home was to find the rainbow that was over their trailer.  Or later on in the novel when the children were trying to fix Ian up with their teacher and mischevious Daphne recalled "her dream" at the dinner table to upset another dinner guest they viewed as a threat for Ian's attention.  Sprinkled throughout this novel are such great little funny moments.  And equally prevalent are the sad moments.  And not just the death of Ian's brother Danny and his wife Lucy.  But when the children do not want to be sent away and don't "know or recall" names, dates, places, to elude their relatives from being found.  Or witnessing their mother's basic breakdown and her desperate solution to find a new man (the typewriter man).  Bea's death, the family dogs death, etc...  When I first read the description of this novel, I thought Ian was going to become entangled with a zealous Christian cult, a subject I am not interested in.  But instead of finding this Church of Second Chances ludricious, (although some rules were) their basic message to work for forgiveness I thought was a sound one.  Like life, trust, relationships, work, forgiveness also takes effort.  Although I don't think I could have given my entire life as Ian seemed too but at least he was noticed for doing so.  Agatha, Thomas, and Daphne genuinely loved him and he them.    My only complain about this book revolved around the swift changes of time.  All of a sudden it was 1988 and Ian was having his own child.  In the latter part of the book I did not feel as connected with the characters as I had in the beginning and middle.  
 I really enjoyed this book from start to finish.  Very inventive story that I could see someone using these tactics from the book in real life 
 This is the first erotica book I've read and I could not put it down after page one. I could not help but be happy that the lead character found who she was and what she could give to other 
 If your a fan of Allen's work than you'll enjoy this book.  Otherwise you may not like it. If you're not familiar with his work than I highly recommend his prose for their witty, bizzare, and humorus content.  In, "The Gossage-Vardebedian Papers," you'll find humor in the trials and tribulations of chess, via letter writing.  In, "Mr. Big," I question if the beautiful existentialist really killed God.  Yeah, she probably did. (GOD that's too bad.)  awkward, funny, weird, smart, read.. 
 My experience has been that that this book covers THE BASICS in a very easy to understand writing style. I am a basic Database (formerly) and C/C++/Assembly (Embedded Hardware)Programmer, with some hands-on and classroom electronics (BS electrical engineering next year) background, but with NO FORMAL Java knowledge, and yet I found the book very easy to read and understand.  As an added bonus I was introduced to JINI Networking concepts in a very gentle way too.  This book will NOT teach you how to write Production Level Code, but that's not the purpose of the book. Instead this book will introduce the Java-Bluetooth beginner to underlying concepts in a straight forward intuitive way, including using a "Hands-On" Bluetooth Kit with 2 Bluetooth enabled Transceivers (highly Recommended if your new to the hardware), and testing bluetooth data encryption "sniffing" techniques with a FREE ad-on that is included with the additional kit.   At the completion of this book you will have to surf the web and study the varios Bluetooth and Wireless Developer Toolkits that are out there.   Finally, I want to thank Bruce Hopkins personally for IMMEDIATELY responding when I e-mailed him, regarding the where-abouts of my kit. It turned out that my kit was sitting at my complex the whole time, which was my fault not Bruce's, but Bruce acted Professionally the whole time, and in a short time we've emailed each other 5 times cumulatively, including a question I had about an SDK not directly mentioned in the book.  In synopsis, Bruce's Book will teach you the BASICS and guide you into finding out for yourself where the next steps lay. For a TRUE BEGINNER this Book is GREAT, and for the seasoned java-bluetooth developer, you'll have to wait for Bruce's next clearly written Intermediate or Advanced Java Bluetooth Masterpiece 
 So many people have gone back to read (or re-read) Mrs. Dalloway since The Hours came out that it almost makes me want to have Hollywood create interesting movie versions of numerous other classics. Think of the possibilities! It's almost a shame that people are forced to "plow through" some of these books as course assignments, where all of their enjoyment is completely lost. With movies, it encourages people to read them voluntarily when they are older and can relate to the themes of the book.  While young teens might find the musings of a middle aged woman confusing or tedious, most of us who are over the age of 25 understand completely where Mrs. Dalloway is coming from. She's wandering through the streets of London, going about the chores before an important party. Her mind is flitting all over as she waits for the road to clear so she can pass, while she chooses flowers, while she runs into friends. She thinks about how the party's going to go, how her daughter's doing, what her husband is up to. She's barely aware of the "real" world around her.  As if this isn't enough, an old boyfriend from her teen years shows up. That sets off all sorts of other thoughts. Should she have stayed with him after all? Then there was that girlish crush she had on a female friend. Someone wants to come to her party who wasn't invited. Her husband's off lunching with another woman. Finally the party starts, and she worries that it's not going well, until she finally settles in and is comfortable.  In amongst all of Mrs. Dalloway's angsts and daydreaming, we also get glimpses into other peoples' minds - her old boyfriend, her daughter, her daughter's tutor, and so on. This lets us view the world from a variety of angles. Tying it together is Big Ben, chiming away the hours as the day goes by.  I realize, if you're used to action-oriented straightforward stories like The Da Vinci Code, that it might take a "slowing down" to read this story. Where I zip through other books at break-neck speed, when I re-read Mrs. Dalloway I have to sit back, take a deep breath, and go along at a slow pace. If you don't quite get the hang of the characters the first time through, read through it again. Once you understand who the people are and how they relate, it makes the inner musings much more clear. It's its own rhythm, the slow, steady rhythm of a day in London. It's not about racing to a goal. It's about the daydreams of life that happen *while* you're preparing for something.  Interestingly, another book - "The Party" - gathers together many of the short stories Woolf wrote at the same time as Mrs. Dalloway. One in particular is a different version of the beginning of this story. In Mrs. Dalloway, the title character is going off to buy flowers for herself. The imagery is very powerful, and very meaningful for women who are used to having flowers bought for them - but not getting them for themselves. Intriguingly, "The Party" version has her going out and getting grey gloves, and wondering if they should have buttons of not. The power of the scene is *really* changed. It makes you wonder what other famous stories had different versions of their beginnings, and how much the story might have been different if they hadn't redone it. I definitely recommend getting both books and reading them together.  Then rent and watch The Hours, and see all of the interweavings of the stories 
 I originally saw it as a NBC mini-series event, and absolutely loved it. There is a remarkable realism on everything you see on it: scenery, costumes, props, you name it. You're really drawn into the time period of that ancient Greece. The cast is remarkable. They all deliver wonderful performances true to the character they play, exept maybe for the main one Jason, as one other reviewer mentioned he lacks a certain commanding prescence, nevertheless, he fits perfectly the words of the script as the "youth with a pleasing face", favored by the gods. This particular movie includes one of the best adaptations ever made of Hercules, true to its myth, and exeptionally cast and performerd, which was very rare to see.  The extras on the DVD could have been better,if not a little longer.Mostly composed of cast and director's quotes with just one overall interview that seems more like a promo for the movie. Overall is a beautiful production with amazing special effects and realism that would please all lovers of ancient Greek myths. I highly recommend it 
 I enjoyed this work.  It was interesting and certainly adds another layer to the mound of Hemingway "I knew him well" literature. I felt the book was worth reading, but do feel that other biographies, by other author's and acquaintances should be read as well, in order to get a full picture of the writer and man Hemingway.  By the author's own admission, this is a work of admiration and should be read as such.  More and more we are finding the existence of the phenomenon of there being more interest in Hemingway the man, rather than Hemingway the author, or, I should say, Hemingway's works.  This is okay by me as I probably fall into that category more and more as the years go by.  This work gives us yet another view of Hemingway the man. The writing is good and holds the reader's interest.  I am not at all sure of the accuracy of some of the facts found in this work as they do not agree with other biographers. In light of the reason this book was written, perhaps these inconsistencies should be overlooked.  After all, this is not hard core history we are talking about here.  All in all I recommend if for a pleasant read, a way to pick up more knowledge of Hemingway and should certainly be added to your Hemingway collection.    
 On a recent trip to the local bookstore, my daughter picked up this book, pulled me to a chair and instructed me to, "Read this please, Mama!"  The cover art caught my attention, but the title... another retelling of the Princess and the Pea left me less enthusiastic.  I began to read...  Each page brought another terrific and interesting illustration, and the text, well... it was fun, smart, funny.  Before I knew it I was completely drawn into the story and having a ball.  More than one adult shopper stopped to listen in, clearly enjoying themselves as well.  Also a first grade teacher, I soon found myself thinking of how I could use this book in class with my students.  High praise for a book to want to take it to work and introduce it to a class full of youngsters.  I'll keep my review short, but suffice it to say, this book is a real winner!  And the illustrations... oh, the illustrations!   I'll admit that I also found myself thinking Caldecott Medal.  
 My husband is a Moroccan and I am a Taiwanese. I love Moroccan food and always want to learn how to make those delicious dishes my mother-in-law made. When I bought this book, my husband and his brother thought the recipes must be westernized. After they tasted my Briouats(shrimp and ground beef) and B'stilla (seafood and chicken), they changed their minds. Most recipes are authentic and easy to follow. It's a great book. I love it!  
 This book presents in interesting dilemma for both Buffy and Anya, even though Anya's temptation wasn't all that convincing to me. I could, however, feel for Buffy. The chance to be with the one you love, forever (literally).  The book itself is well written, as are the characters, for the most part. I enjoyed the part that Spike plays (tied naked to his bed nonetheless). Anya was a bit too over-written, too much sex/-money talk. Not as great as other Buffy novels, but still a good read 
 Great classic horror, but remember to bring a hankie. Lon Chaney Jr. portrayed the creature with great emotion. A must see 
 Very well written for the established learner - could prove frustrating for novice students.  Many case studies with real world events to allow interactive exchange btw students - but requires professorial oversight to get beyond group think, interpersonal dynamics, and subjective bias.  
 This is a grest book to explain the science of behavior as it relates to work environment.  Great stuff.  Very powerful and well written.  
 As a 20 year vertan of the US Navy I know a little bit about Leadership and Teamwork. Brace Barber examines the complexities of Leadership and shows everyone how it is teamwork, team building and faith that makes a great leader. By Far the best book on leadership for the Corporate and Military world I have ever read. You do not need to be in or have served in the military to learn something from this book. For those who equate military leadership with not having anything to do with the corporate world, you are sadly mistaken. I have paralelled my personal corporate and military experiences with those that Brace has written into his book and I was amazed by the similarities and the lessons I learned through them. In some cases the lesson I have learned was to make better choices in my leadership style.  A real Leader is also the Servant to those being led. Brace illustrates that clearly here 
 this book is not some boring bio but written more like a conversation with janice herself...its real and doesnt hide too much of anythin 
 Great poems for Thanksgiving.  Fun to read aloud with one child or a group of children.  I used it in my classroom for many years.  I bought this copy to donate to the library at my church 
 This is a memmorable book for a chil 
 If you ever asked yourself, "what would happen if Woverine were bad" then this book is for you. The Hand and Hydra team up and take over Logan using him as their ultimate killing machine. There are a lot of good cameos in here such as The X-Men, FF, Avengers, Shield, Daredevil and Electra, even the Slingers Hornet is in here, but I wont tell you exactly what his cameo is about.   I would go as far to say this is a Electra book as much as it is a Wolverine book. She is sent by Shield to take out Wolverine and does a lot of @$$ kicking in the process.   Mark Millar and John Romita JR. do a excellent job story telling, the only draw back to this book is the story doesn't finish at the end, I have to wait until vol. 2 comes out and who knows how long that will take. I like this book a lot but my advice to all who might consider buying this is you might want to wait until the come out with a "Enemy of the State" collected edition, because the end of the book really leaves you hanging 
 I suppose that my love for this cookbook was sealed with the word "Weber" in the title.  My love of Weber grills aside, this is a must have cookbook for any griller, serious or otherwise.  My prerequisite for a cookbook is great, easy to understand recipes with incredible pictures.  My next cookbook benchmark is to check how many pages are stained or "dog-earred".  The Big Book of Grilling has both...in spades.  I have used this book steadily since it first came out and I still find new things that I have past over and end up enjoying years down the road.  Consider adding this book to your grilling arsenal, you will not be disappointed. 
 Saved me twice so far... Tow rope got me out of a snow bank... Has almost everything you need, some things are kind of cheap, but in general, the product gets the job done.. 
 Pretty serving tray, my only complaint is that I thought it might be a bit taller, but it will still do it's job at a buffet table.  Very pretty and great for the price.  The glass is nice and thick and the line of products is beautiful.  I do see the handle becoming a problem after constant use, but who uses these things constantly.  My problem I mean the silver coming off.  Still recommend it.  You won't regret it 
 Now don't get scared by the young Kenny Chesney.  He may look young, but his songs aren't so immature.  He has a few great hits on this CD including the title track, "Me and You".  This song is Timeless and is played at weddings all the time.  How fitting is the song though... absolutely.  And then his fan favorite is found on this album... which is my absolute favorite KC song ever.. "Back Where I Come From" and this is the studio version... which I happen to like more.  The song about growing up in the country.. "Some say it's a backwards place, narrow minds on a narrow way.. but i make it a point to say that's where I come from".  If you get a chance to see Kenny Live.. this is one of the greatest parts of the show.. he has clips of when he was younger.  It is a great show.  The rest of the cd has some great songs... pick it up.. I promise you won't be dissapointed 
 I really enjoy reading Sedaris.  I love how he can make you cringe & laugh on the same page.  My favorite by far, "Naked".  He's got a wonderful style of keeping you interested, you cannot read fast enough!  If you enjoy his work, you will also like Augusten Burroughs 
 This book is easy to review, and a no-brainer for people interested on consicousness studies. It is quite simply the most complete anthology on the philosophy of consciousness out there. Papers from William James, to Dennett, Searle, Block, Naegel, and over 50 others. Qualia, explanatory gaps, zombies, inverted qualia, some scientific papers, one of the best intoductions to the field out there.....700+ pages of consciousness, consciousness, consciousness....this is essential reading, and having for anyopne interested in philosophy of mind, and scientists of mind too...the fastest way to familiarize with the vast literature on the subject. The table of contents is reason enough to buy this book, and I will not bore you with more 
 Artists, when describing the act of painting a masterpiece, will often claim that they felt "lost" in their work.  Likewise, a basketball player may describe the experience of setting up the winning play as having an altered perception of time, as if twelve seconds actually extended for hours.  When we are truly engaged and at the highest states of enjoyment, we experience the freedom of complete absorption in activity. Mihaly Czikszentmihalyi, Professor of Psychology at Claremont Graduate University, first coined the term "flow" in 1975 to describe this experience, and has written several books about the concept including the bestseller Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience in 1990.  Through a series of interviews with successful business leaders who combine high achievement with strong moral commitment, Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning explores the connection between flow and work.  Csikszentmihalyi claims that our jobs have a significant influence on the quality of our lives. He explains that happiness is not something that happens to us, but rather is something we make happen.  As such, work can be one of the most fulfilling aspects of life, provided that employees have an opportunity to do their best and to contribute to something greater than themselves.    He makes a profound distinction between the concepts of pleasure and enjoyment: pleasure is a conservative force that makes us want to satisfy existing needs and does not foster change, whereas enjoyment is not always pleasant, and can be sometimes stressful.  Csikszentmihalyi describes enjoyment as the sensation of being fully alive, triumphing over the forces of entropy and decay.  A mountain climber, for example, who is utterly exhausted after an dangerous climb but who wouldn't want to be anywhere else in the world than at the peak of a mountain, perhaps does not experience pleasure, but does experience enjoyment.  Likewise, while relaxing in a hammock at the beach may be pleasurable, it cannot compare to the exhilaration and "flow" felt by the mountain climber.  Similarly, an employee who holds a demanding and stressful position may not experience pleasure on the job, but for some, the challenge presented by the work is often enjoyable and can lead to "flow."  For others, however, a demanding job may be overwhelming and may be experienced as drudgery, not enjoyment.  Csikszentmihalyi explores characteristics that are common to organizations that support flow.   Csikszentmihalyi claims that leaders of organizations can actively create conditions to ensure that every employee has an opportunity to fully develop and express their potentialities and as a result experience flow.  He explains that clear goals, good feedback, and incremental challenges are important factors that facilitate employee growth.   First, goals must be clear both on an organizational and individual level.  An employee must not only embrace the goals for the organization, he/she must trust their leader's commitment to those goals and must see how his/her individual activities align with the larger vision.  Likewise, employees must have access to effective and meaningful feedback, not only to improve performance, but to be reassured that the leaders of the organization care deeply about their work.  Finally, challenges presented to employees must be matched with their level of skill.  Tasks that are too easy make experiences of flow and enjoyment more difficult to create, whereas challenges that are too great are simply overwhelming. Csikszentmihalyi states that actively creating conditions for flow is one of the best strategies for getting employees to give their best.  The assertions in the book are not clearly substantiated by research.   Most of Csikszentmihalyi's claims seem to be derived from his earlier works and mapped onto workplace situations, corroborated by anecdotal evidence captured in interviews.  A careful review of the book's notes reveal that an overwhelming majority of the thirty-nine business leaders who were interviewed were male and over the age of fifty.  It remains to be seen if a more diverse group would have provided different accounts of flow at the workplace.  Nevertheless, the book is an uplifting read and reminds us that work can indeed be enjoyable.  It contains many inspirational quotes and anecdotes from today's business leaders, and presents a unique perspective on finding happiness 
 This book is a feast for embroiderers be they new to the art or experienced stitchers. It allows you to see how projects can be worked with a whole new slant, using a multitude of threads and fabrics. You can set  about designing your own projects using similar techniques, proving that  experimentation can be fun and successful. A must have for needlewomen! 
 I live in Kobe, Japan. I went a concert of Kremerata Baltica last year. Fortunately I encountered this program, "Eight Seasons". Everybody who was there at that night is a witness of miracle. So nice  play, very few left concert hall. This CD is also very impressive, I found.  Kremer is also good for very classical classic. Buy one copy 
 While I thought this book was worthwhile in many respects, especially with regard to the info. on Mertz/ Soetre, ULTIMATE SACRIFICE is simply the best book ever on the JFK assassination.Still, worth your time.

 this toy was not purchased for any education value, was purchased for fun and enjoyment.  the iron is fun, durable and looks especially cute 
 I am 12 and I used to wear pull ups due to accidents. One day when I was at Walmart I had to go potty really bad. I went to the restroom and it was full. I realized I had to make the decision to use my pull up even though I wasnt supposed to. I pottyed in the pull up. I ran to the underwear department and grabed these hanes. I went to another bathroom, took off my pull up cleaned up and put the underwear on. To my amazement they were comfortable. Later that night my step dad came in to put me in my pull up. I surprised him by taking off my clothes and revealing my underwear. He was so proud of me and my decision. Problem with these is that sometimes I wet the bed and they show stains but I keep on wearing them. The briefs gave me the confedence to breakaway from the pull ups and be a real big boy 
 Great reminder of the time, very funny, great music,great actors, just worth it in every way 
 GODS AND GENERALS is an extremely well done and fascinating book.  The author, Jeff Shaara, did an excellent job of interpreting the characters. His task was a difficult one because his father's book, THE KILLER ANGELS is a classic in the chronicles of Civil War stories.  This book precedes the one written by his father.   GODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to the beginning of the Civil War and through many of the battles. The major players in the story are Winfield Scott, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Hancock and Lawrence Chamberlain.  The career biographies of these famous men were striking.  After reading of their early lives and service experiences, it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the Union Army. They were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends.  I listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by Dick Estell.  He brought the characters to life by his narration. This book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history. 
 what is your life's purpose / your soul's mission - this book might offer insight. It is rather huge (in both size and number of pages), and it is true that only a few pages in total pertain to any one person, but I am still very happy to own it (when I can get it back from my friends :)) 
 Humphrey Van Weyden, a pampered son of wealth, has lived a comfortable life of bookishness and learning in 1890's San Francisco.  But everything changes when an accident on a ferry-trip across the bay leaves him floating helpless in a foggy sea.  He is picked up by a schooner heading out to hunt seals, captained by the vicious Wolf Larsen.  He is immediately pressed into service as cabin-boy aboard the Ghost, and learns a different kind of life than he has been raised to know.  Wolf Larsen is not only brutal and overbearing to everyone he encounters, but he is also highly intelligent, having taught himself reading and mathematics.  "Hump," as Humphrey is called by the Captain, gains some measure of favor with the Captain as he is able to discuss philosophy and such things of which the rest of the crew is wholly ignorant.  The characters and plot are intensely compelling, especially throughout the first half of the book where the drama is intense as he struggles to survive aboard the Ghost.  His observations of the other crew members are interesting, as he discovers how different their lives are from his, and he feels pity for the things they lacked and which he took for granted.  Also, the character of Captain Larsen is incredible; completely horrible yet you feel a sort of sympathy even for him.    My biggest complaint with the story is at about its midpoint where a woman character enters the story.  The struggle for life suddenly takes on a different meaning for Humphrey, as he now has someone other than himself to worry about, but this changes the whole mood of the story.  The struggle is no longer filled with the painful drama, but practically turns into a romance, and a fairly sappy one, at that.  It's also here that the book slows down with quite a few long passages about the mechanics and technical details of ships and sailing.  But overall a very interesting tale of struggle - it's just unfortunate that the ending wasn't as strong 
 I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.  I bought it as a remainder for next to nothing and was pre-reading it to see when my niece would be old enough for it -- if it were good enough to give her, that is.  As it turns out, I find myself jealous of her getting to be old enough to read it, because I think she's going to dive in and only surface for meals.    One reason I liked this book so much, I think, is because the theory of quantum alternate universes is an idea that I find very persuasive and comforting.  As a result, this novel gives me more food for thought to chew over while it also mixes in the "supernatural" aspects of the family tree, the oddly old and young Aldous, and so on.  As an adult who was once a child who experienced a painful loss of a loved one, I found the treatment of grief to be very affecting as well.  I was disappointed to find that the second Withern Rise book is not yet out in paperback.  My niece has probably 4 years until she's old enough to start the trilogy, and I hope I'll have finished all three before then.  ;-)  The one argument I have with the book is the rather spare style in which it's written.  It feels to me as if some coloring and fleshing out is missing, although from reading the author's comments in the essays at the end of the volume, I can see that's a deliberate choice of his.  This difference in taste is far from sufficient to turn me off the book, however 
 Brit Hand,educated half Comanche inherets his white father's ranch and decides he will run it himself.  Upon entrance on the land, he encounters a very tall spirited red headed woman named Temper.  She announces that she does not want any man, since her cruel hearted husband was killed and that she will remain as cook and housekeeper as long as he keeps that in mind.  Temper is known to keep a knife in her boot to fight off any unwanted advances and the men on the ranch know she is off limits.  Brit encounters some hesitentcy at his control over the ranch, but the men know as the owner they must do as he says.  Brit joins in the work earning the respect of most of the hands, but before long someone is leaving signs warning him off.  When he refuses the offer of his neighbor and retired judge to buy his land, he starts falling prey to mysterious cattle rustlers.  Before long, Temper has melted the ice around Brit's heart and he makes no excuses to hide his hunger for her and soon she is just as eager for him.  Soon Temper and Brit face danger, not only to their relationship, but their lives as well.  This is a well written story with two likeable characters with a lot of depth.  Temperence is a delight, strong but vulnerable enough to make for a good romantic character.  Brit, sexy and proud, but not overly so.  The only thing I didn't like is all writers of Historical Indian romance seem to have the same villans recycled time after time.  A fresh controversy would be nice 
 Guido von List was the leader of the Armanen-Orden, the single most important magical order of the 20th century. This book deserves to be on every thinking Germanic Heathen and Magician's bookshelf...  Many of List's ideas influenced the most important thinkers of the modern Heathen revival, including Edred Thorsson...  The Armanen-Orden still survives in Germany, and von List's Futhork is no less powerful today than it was when it was revealed to him in 1903. In English speaking lands the Knights of Runes continues his tradition.  BUY THIS BOOK 
 I actually kind of stumbled upon this album by accident. I heard the single "Brother" on the radio and liked it, without knowing anything about the band. Come to find out, the lead guitarist was in and co-founder of one of my favorite bands, that band being Sevendust. Then my interest peeked even more. Clint Lowry is one of my favorite guitarist's, his work in Sevendust through the years was fantastic, and he doesn't dissapoint in Dark New Day. The rest of the band doesn't dissapoint either. I think someone else mentioned it already, but Dark New Day is steeming with confidence, and it shows up clearly.   When I actually heard the album, I was instantly blown away. Its just that good. The vocals are strong and captivating. Brett Hestla does a fantastic job on main vocals.  The intro on Taking Me Alive sounds incredible. The build-up is phenomenal, and once it kicks in, your ready to go. A great way to kick off a album. The whole album is really full of great songs. If I had to pick my favorites or standouts, I'd go with: Taking Me Alive, Brother, Pieces, Fill Me Again, Evergreen; but there really is not a bad track to be found.  Bottom line, this is a great album. Like others have mentioned, if your a fan of Sevendust, this will be right up your alley. If your a fan of good hard rock, 12 Year Silence might be in your cd player for awhile. Highly Recommended 
 One of my biggest regrets in life is that I didn't stick with my piano lessons when I was a child. I took for about three years, never practiced, and basically, have to struggle through most arrangements, usually with only the right hand. This book, however, makes me feel like a virtuoso!  The book includes familiar sections of well-known classical pieces. Each one is done in a very simple arrangement that somehow still captures the essence of the original composition.   I am able to sit down and sight-read most of the pieces without too much difficulty, and within a week or so of practicing, even my husband (a true musician) admits that I don't sound too bad.   The book is easy enough that I don't get frustrated, yet challenging enough to give me a sense of accomplishment. I highly recommend it to anyone who's taken lessons for about 3 to 4 years. 
 A wonderful book full of unforgettable psychological trials and triumphs.  This book reels you in with the bizarre, takes a glimpse at the various therapy techniques used today, AND makes you really step back, reconsider, and re-evaluate your own perceptions of what is considered strange.  If you want to think even further outside the box, READ THIS BOOK 
 I found the subject matter very fascinating.  It wasn't a particularly easy book for me to read because he just is very scholarly in his writing.  He shows his educational abilities.  It wasn't down to earth.  I thought it would be more slang.  Too intelligent is what I mean I suppose.  He seems to go over and over the same idea.  And the bottom line is that not all black men are hung.  And I could never figure out if he was blaming white America for stereotyping black men as sexual objects of fascination, but it seemed to be that way.  The subject didn't need to be that scholarly 
 Hovering somewhere around 100 pages, _Where Angels Fear to Tread_ is a good, short weekend read. The novela tells the story of an upperclass British family that travels to Italy to save the son of their late daughter-in-law from a savage upbringing by his Italian father, their daughter-in-laws second husband. There aren't a whole lot of happy moments in the novella - on the whole it's pretty depressing, but it was never boring, and the characters, some lovable, some completely aggravating, were at least interesting. Having never read any other works by E.M. Forster, I am not cut out to comment on style, but knowing that this was his first work makes me really want to read his later novels - this was great for a first effort, so I'm sure his more mature work is fantastic.  
 This is one of the better books I've ever read. The research of Sophie Coe is quite amazing and her passion for the history of chocolate is contagious. Her husband Michael is a beautiful writer...and he was called on to finish this the last work of his brilliant wife who died before it could be completed. I loved this book ! 
 The Bible for Dummies is easy to read, easy to understand, long on facts and helpful explanations, short on opinions and interpretations, and very helpful overall.  I highly recommend this book.  Its insightful writing has generated several good discussions with my Bible study group 
 I was drawn to this book after reading Arthur Phillips first novel, Prague.  It was a wonderful slice of life of American ex-pats living in Budapest during the early nineties.  With The Egyptologist Phillips proves he is not a one hit wonder.  All of the appeal of his semi-autobiographical novel translates perfectly to The Eygptologist.  The reader will find himself alternating allegiences and trying to figure out which character is telling the truth.  The entire book is written in the form of letters and journal entries so the reader must expect the character to paint himself in a better light than what probably happened.  As the book spirals towards the conclusion the reader has no idea who is the "good guy," who is honest or who is crazy.  It is a great read that is highly addictiv 
 I first read this when I was 13 or 14 and never forgot the story.  I just reread it 40 years later while vacationing in Central America, the perfect place for a tale of the rain forest.  The language is exquisite - not a quick read, for I wanted to absorb the beauty of the descriptions and details.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in nature, for it is not only a wonderful love story, but also a vivid description of the Venezuelan rain forest and its indigenous people 
 The book starts with the legend of the thornbird - a bird who searches all his life for a thorn bush and once he finds it, impales himself on the thorn and while doing so sings the most beautiful song, even better that that of a lark or a nightingale and the song is so beautiful that even God smiles.   For the best is only bought at the cost of great pain.   This single sentence seems to sum up the common element binding the entire book.  The Thornbirds is the story of the Cleary family, and their journey from their unpretentious roots in New Zealand where they worked as sheep shearers, to the huge Australian sheep farm Drogheda, owned by Paddy Cleary's autocratic sister. The family being Irish, the land is in their blood and from the time that they arrive on Drogheda the land plays a unmistakeable part in their fortunes and destinies. The story spans 3 generations from Paddy Cleary and his wife Fiona, their sons and only daughter Meggie and the Catholic priest Ralph De Bricassart, to Meggie's children - the exotic actress Justine and priest Dane.  But we see all this mostly through the interaction of Meggie with her family and her forbidden love for Father Ralph.  The author Colleen McCullough has a wonderful descriptive style of writing. From the the dry dust, heat and flies of the Australian Outback, the relentless forces of nature like storms, drought, wildfires, to the power-hungry corridors of the Vatican all are brought to life in the pages of this book. And the element of love and pain is dealt with in a balanced way and not over excessively.  However, only the main characters are really 3D, and I often found myself skipping through large parts of the book that didn't interest me.  Overall it is a must read as it makes us realize love is not just demanding and wanting its more so about giving and sacrificing 
 I have to admit it, I am a little "tired" of The Beatles -- and very sick of Paul McCartney ... but, this album -- NEVER ... I love it!!!!   It's imaginative (no pun intended) -- it's clear, it's fun, it's perfect 
 I will admit right up front that John Dicker has written a clearly biased book against Wal-Mart. He is out to expose all that is bad about Wal-Mart and is reluctant to point out any good things about Wal-Mart (if there even are any). That being said, there are plenty of bad things to write about, and Dicker covers them all. The poor wages, forcing stores on communities that don't want one, foreign sweat shops, putting local small businesses out of business, and practicing censorship by not selling CDs and other items that don't mesh with the "family-friendly" image of Wal-Mart. The quintessential problem with Wal-Mart is that with every charge that is thrown at it, it views the each problem as a public relations matter and think that they need to work on adjusting their image, not their behavior.  In the end, Dicker does briefly play devil's advocate and points out that Wal-Mart provides jobs for poor people (even if they are paid very little) and provides affordable goods in communities where other retailers refuse to go. Dicker suggests that rather than get people to stop shopping at Wal-Mart, we should ask Wal-Mart to be a better company. Easier said than done 
 A very touching & heart warming story about life that most people can relate to.  The stranger was fantastic with his emotions,as were Lizzie and Marie. Overall the story was great.  Jasmin 
 I was once a high priest in the New Age, and drank human blood in sacrificial rituals devoted to glorious Lucifer (we would use a picture of a handsome blonde blue eyed model from Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine to stand-in for Lucifer).  Of course, Ben Creme was there spouting his nonsense about Maitreya, but he's the New Age version of the looney old man you see wandering out with a shopping cart full of empty soda pop cans in a seedy part of downtown - sort of deluded. But the New Age is benovelent and loves everyone.  The New Age is evil, and all books under that title contain hidden codes that lead to where Jimmy Hoffa is buried, which is just the beginning of a natural neophyte treasure hunt that must be successfully completed before anyone can become part of the White Brotherhood of Glory.   However, like so many baby boomers, after a life time of experimental sex, drugs, power, money and New Age beliefs, I've come back home to fundamentalist Christianity!  Now, no longer do I drink human blood in adoration of Lucifer. Instead, I drink the blood and body of Jesus Christ in adoration of Father, Son and Holy Ghost. I am saved, but keep crufixies and lots of garlic around my windows to keep out the ethereal minions of the New Age! 
 We have a new little four month old baby and so really wanted to get a good camera to take the normal hundreds of pictures parents take of their first baby doing nothing! The picture quality is amazing and we love that we can take short videos-it's perfect for the sweet little moments you want to be able to catch in an instant. We did our research before we purchased and this camera was a Consumer Reports Best Buy and a great value for the money. We would recommend it to anyone. 
 This, believe it or not, is a very high-quality edition from, of all people, Crossway. A beautiful, calfskin edition with soft, luxuroius leather, and it is smyth-sewn, folks!! Thus, the Bible will last a long time. It  has 10.5 print(same as Deluxe Reference Bible), maps, centre-column references, and a concordance, plus Book Intros. The only complaint I have is that, of the two ribbon markers, the one presumably for the OT is cut about an inch-and-a-half shorter, so it barely extends past the bottom of the page. not good. But, I am sure that this one will outlats me!  It does retail for $195, so cheap it aint. Regarding the translation, it is a literal translation of the Scriptures, adapted from the RSV, so it sounds just like the RSV. It is not as literal as the NASB or NASBU, and it is not as wooden as that translation 
 I wore these tights with my wonderwoman costume for halloween when I had a kids party in my home. These tights were just gorgeous and felt wonderful. They looked great and made my legs look fantastic. I really love them. They look and feel like professional dancer tights.  I highly recommend these tights to wear with costumes or for dance class!  Thanks! Ton 
 Back during the brief period when the Los Angeles Times pretended to care about science it ran a weekly column by K. C. Cole. The Times, unfortunately, has reverted to viewing science as something to egregiously misrepresent in its daily reporting. But Cole's columns live on, and are now available to a larger audience. A physicist by training, I am often disappointed by science books because they achieve understandability by subtly misrepresenting the essence of difficult concepts. Cole, on the other hand, has a knack for explaining difficult concepts in simple terms without sacrificing veracity. This book is both a pleasurable and accurate read on topics of current interest in science. I highly recommend it to people wanting to better understand modern science 
 The original movie, like so many originals, is the best.  Fun movie.  The second one is pretty cheesy.  The first one was definitely worth the price 
 Yep, this is a great collection of Eliot's works. I initially found out about Eliot throught the Movie 'Apocalypse Now' in which Brando is heard reciting the poem 'The Hollow Men'. The poem sounded so good I hunted it down and came across this little book.  My favourite poems would have to be 'The Hollow Men', 'Love song of Prufrock', 'Ash Wednesday' and 'Rannoch, by Glencoe (perfectly captured, drive through Rannoch and you'll see ;-)  Yep, definetly worth a read 
 Clouds In My Coffee, a three CD box set, is the most luscious collection of Carly Simon songs!  This set appeared a teeny bit expensive on the surface and I hestitated and gawked for awhile (I am very, very picky), but once I took the plunge, I was richly rewarded.  This box set includes beautiful photographs and writing on Carly's unfolding and blossoming music career and gives an in-depth sense of who Carly is as a person in many ways.  A book and CDs in one package.  An absolutely gorgeous gift for anyone seriously appreciative of Carly's music. A fine treat for yourself. I will treasure this collection for a very long time 
 A bit of a slow starter but really picks up along the way. The literary allussions are a little too much for me but I'm sure it'll appeal to a lot of  people.   Great mystery set in the transition years of the early '90's. I thoroughly reccomend it. 
 I read this book when I was around 7.  I remember being incredibly entertained.  However, the public library did not have volume III, so I've only read volumes I and II.  This IS something I would reccomend for children (but if you are a parent who would rather not have your child learn about sex or violence for whatever reason, then don't).  It's great for kids and adults alike 
 My 4 year old son loved this book so much when we checked it out of the library, that I had to buy one for him.  He now asks for his quilt every night and settles in for the night faster.  It is a gentle story of love that readers of all ages will enjoy 
 Impossible to put down. You cannot wait to see what mistake or twist of bad luck follows these people 
 The first reason that I loved this book was the theme of foreign-ness. I guess I could identify, having lived in two different countries, back and forth all of my life, and feeling that part of me is a foreigner no matter where I am.  I thought that this book captured that feeling.  But the other and bigger thing that I loved about this book and what held all of the stories together for me, was that vague ache in my heart...it has to do with the foreign-ness, but that is not all.  It has to do with love, with loss, with real life that may be mostly happy but always has a back side of pain to it, with relationships that you WANT so badly to be good, but aren't always what you want. The ache that I felt in my heart all through this book felt real, the ache of life.  
 This is a very nice recording of these symphonies. I had been trying to find all three together for a while, and I was so happy when I found this. I would highly reccommend it to anyone who enjoys Dvorak 
 After seeing these guys live a few times during the glory days, I have a lot of respect for them.  This album is KILLER.  Every track rocks.  For those of you who haven't seen the movie, go check out CLAY PIGEONS, which features "Timebomb" as the opening track.  The soundtrack has tons of other awesome alt/country/punk music on it.  I recommend TOO FAR TO CARE to anyone who likes CMT and country radio.. 
 I like what the last reviewer said about this book.  It is a lot like an x-rated cyberpunk cat-in-the-hat.  Though it is funny that he didn't realize that's how this book (and other work by this author) is supposed to be read.  Like Baby Jesus Butt Plug and Menstruating Mall, CM3 writes xxx surrealism with a children's book style narrative.  That's what makes it unique.  I personally think he's the best thing to come out of the book industry in years.  Well, perhaps not the best, but at least the most unusual.  
 We are now in another one of those periods of revival of interest in, and appreciation of, Jane Austen. There have been at least two films, one cable one commercial, released over the past several years that are based on one of her better novels, The Pride and Prejudice. Ordinarily I have found that films made for cable are inferior to those produced for the commercial film market. Not here. The A&E production is far superior in presentation not the least of which is that it is truer to the Austen story line than the commercial film. Moreover, as an added treat, the film itself is over five hours long and therefore can get a leisurely treatment to Austen's themes of love and life, horse riding and letter writing among the early 18th century English `squirearcy'. Despite the length the film moves along with few dull spots.  And what of the story line? Well it seems that certain very rich young landowner, a Mr. Darcy, with just the right connections and, Miss Elizabeth Bennett, one of five daughters of a country squire who estate has been entailed away from any ability to provide for his wife and daughters are smitten with each other. However both parties must endure many trials and tribulations, to speak nothing of personal misunderstandings between them, before the romantic tensions can be resolved and they can snuggle down in Mr. Darcy's little mansion. On a personal level this is about overweening pride (naturally) -his- that stood for a long time in the way of unleashing his feelings is an adult way. The prejudice part comes from both parties as both are very class-conscious and committed to the, frankly, unseemly and irrationally snobbish nature of the English gentry. In the end, (since we know that the couple will ride happily into the sunset) Austen's looks at English morals, mores and manners just before the full effects of the Industrial Revolution hit that society is what drives one to watch the movie. Ms. Austen had a very good ear for picking up the language of these `gentle' people.  Damn it though, those times were tough for an independent-minded intelligent young woman with no means. Kudos to Miss Elizabeth Bennett.                   
 I am SO pleased with this book.  I rarely have time to write reviews but am blown off by this book.  It's probably the best knitting book I've bought in quite a while.  And I have a LOT of them!  I would like to make the majority of items here.  All very pretty, stylish and flattering.  None of the old style long baggy jumpers with tight rib at the bottom.  Really lovely.  The sweaters are graded and there's everything from stuff for the beginner all the way up.  She gives suggestions on how to give each item a different look too.  There are a few accessories including a pretty lacy scarf and shawl, and a cloche and gloves.  Just enough.  They're all pretty special.  Tops that can be worn out at night - camis and longsleeved - as well as daywear.  Really cute cardis and jackets.    AND there's a really great techniques section at the book.  This is amazing.  For someone who has just gotten into lace knitting, she includes drawings of how to do yarnovers in between different combis of stitches and at ends of a row- something that has baffled me for a while.  Short rows, everything.  I hate having to dig up different books when Ï come to a technique I'm not sure of.  thank you!  Yarns used tend to be rowan, jaeger, and aretesano alpaca. And she is not a fan of the huge needle yarn.  Luckily i am so over that phase now... they're so uncomfortable.  It has to be a really cute pattern to attract me to anything over 8mm max.  Most of these patterns run between 3mm and 4mm needles.  She uses colourwork and beadwork but not in huge quantities - just enough to give style.  I'm not a fan of either, I tend to prefer texture, whether lacey or cabley - which she has lots of too - but I really like these.  Caveat for the larger ladies - only a couple of items go over a 40inch bust.  That said, I'm sure you could adapt some of them.  I HIGHLY recommend this book..... 
 Calvin Schwa seems to be invisible.  Now you see him, now you don't.  Antsy Bonano and his group decide to study this "Schwa effect" and use it for financial gain by taking wagers on Calvin's ability to enter improbable places unseen. The scheme is  profitable until they accept a bet to steal a dog dish from the home of Mr. Crawley, the neighborhood eccentric. The Schwa is discovered by Crawley who can see him very clearly.  As punishment, Calvin and Antsy become dog-walkers for the old man's 14 dogs. Later Crawley asks Antsy to befriend his visiting granddaughter, Lexie, who is blind.  Schwa, Antsy and Lexie begin a search into Calvin's past and try to find out what happened to  his mother. Is Calvin's "invisibility" tied to his past?   This detailed story is a page turner.  Schusterman writes with compassion and humor.   As someone who works in a school setting, I found the story very moving because these "invisible" kids are in our classes. They are quiet, engaged and self sufficient so we sometimes overlook them. So much of a teacher's attention is claimed by high-needs students but the quiet ones also need all the recognition and acknowledgement that their teachers and friends can give them. The Schwa reminds me to make an even greater effort to keep these kids on the radar!  This is a great read that will be appreciated by kids in grades 4 and up 
 While not an exhaustive reference or a scholarly-style examination of the subject, this covers the basic eras, the essential films, and most famous artists of samurai cinema.  It is a helpful "users manual" for those looking to get into this genre, as it provides a commentary on each film and gives a rating of how available they are on Region 1 DVD.   
 I have to use this honey pie pony thing cause Milkshake isn't on here. Milkshake is lovely. She smells like coconut and a cupcake. You can make up soooo many stories with her it is just soooooo cool. As for honey pie, i think she is cute but has a gross smell. I don't like cookie doe iether. I like Orange twist, though. She is the second best smelling. Milkshake orange twist cookie doe honey pie That's the order of who smells the best at the top to the worst at the bottem and honey pie wins the prize!!!!! lol.

 Partner volume to Alan Moorehead's "White Nile"...and also a straight-out 5-star historical and literary work.   A splendid visit to a long "secret" Ethiopia...for adders, beautully written and researched.  Robert E. Fuisz, M 
 Dr. Weil's book is a refreshing change from society's(and some authors) obsession with antiaging methods that are usually only money makers and do nothing to make you younger.This book talks first about the current trend to "reverse aging" which the author believes is impossible. Then he goes on to talk about how natural the aging process is and how it should be viewed as positive in many ways. He discusses how many things get better with age,cheese,wine,beef, etc. He says we should accept aging not resist it and should live a healthy lifestyle so we will have healthy aging with out being ravaged by the diseases that are a consequence of lifestyle.Great writing, a pleasure to read 
 This is the one book about perennials to own if you can only own one -- part growing manual, part plant reference encyclopedia, and part garden design guide.  I stumbled into gardening by accident, having avoided it throughout my youth, but once I caught "the bug," I wanted to learn in a hurry how to do it correctly.  This book was (and is) the perfect choice.   Actually, I discovered the advantages of this book backwards: I began by just using it to look up the dozens of plants that I began to bring home from nurseries with the word "perennial" on their hangtags.  After a while, I noticed that it had great advice on how to keep the ones that were dying under my care from, well, dying under my care.  And eventually I saw that Phillips and Burrell were also smarter than me about how to plan out my garden, for both improved aesthetics and healthier plants.  One aspect of this book that I liked from Day One is that the authors speak the non-gardener version of English, so it's easy to understand and follow. One would think all gardening books would be down-to-earth (pun intended), but no...not like this one.  If you have a garden already, you might want to start using this book by charting out the current layout of the garden and labeling each plant.  Don't worry - the book is filled with full-color photographs to help you identify anything that you don't recognize by name.  And pretty soon you'll not only see options you hadn't considered before, you'll even know what to ask for at the nursery or home center.  Have fun with it.  I know I do 
 When I first saw the movie, on a Saturday afternoon "Creature Feature", with some family members, I bragged that the music was done John Williams ...because that same music was featured in "Lost in Space" over and over alot.  Little did I realize, after looking at the credits, that it was Bernard Herrmann...in fact the 'recycled music' used in the LIS series was from this movie: ..DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL; and Bernard was never listed in the credits on the LIS TV show --not even as 'additional music by'--to avoid paying him any royalties; & that was WRONG.  That just goes to show how GOOD the music is..a real treasure 
 As this was the second DVD with Taylor Mason, I fully expected some repitition, due to the fact many comedians have a tendency to repeat much of their material.  However, everything was as fresh as if I was hearing him for the first time, and it was just as funny as the first one.  Mason is every bit as funny as Cosby, if not funnier.  He pokes fun at himself, which makes the whole thing hilarious, and he's a load of talent, with his ventriliquism and music adding to it.  Great for everyone 
 I am finding this work book to go along very well with my Pimsleur language CDs.  There are good exercises to reinforce useage. I am a beginner learner and am finding it well written, easy to follow and extremely helpful.  I am using it in conjunction with Barron's Italian Verb work book as well and am finding that they explain things a little differently from each other, so what I don't get from one I get from the other 
 I found this book to be very helpful to read to get my head around the changes about to occur as I neared the end of my pregnancy.  It is reassuring that the authors are doctors, but it is their knowledge as parents and doctors that really offers the best advice.  I liked the straightforward, non-medical way of writing, and the short chapters so that you don't get information overload like other books do.   I used it a lot as a reference after we brought baby home, too, and was glad that I had read through it once before I was sleep-deprived.  A very useful "user's manual" for baby 
 So refreshing to find an author that is not shamelessly hawking  fluffy books and get-rich-quick seminars to pad his personal bank account.  Michael Zaransky is clearly a serious investor/operator in the student housing sector, and openly shares his experience and perspectives.  He doesn't predict or guarantee overnight wealth nor an easy path to accomplish instant success as some no-brainer exercise.  As he tells us, it requires up-front analysis, discipline, and involving professionals in the process.  What Zaransky does provide are objective statistics and trends from reputable third parties, along with solid guidelines to make the investing process a prudent one.  Using this info and approach, he patiently and with proper due diligence, evaluates each deal on all its merits.  He also advocates walking away when the deal doesn't meet the established criteria.    I have been an active player in the student housing market for 30-plus years and found his book to be practical and on the money. I would highly encourage any real estate investor whether novice or seasoned, to take advantage of a great resource 
 Great book!  It's comprehensive and easy to understand.  Highly recommended textbook.  
 I found this book to be quite enlightening in the sense that many do not want to recognize the social injustices that have plagued our society and ignored women's achievements throughout history.  Not unlike the  achievement gap that exists between poor and minority students and their  more priveleged counterparts, it is crucial to address and evaluate the  institutional barriers that exist within many school cultures today.   Students who are disadvantaged because of biases that impede their  emotional, career, and academic development in school and in their life  deserve the additional support and attention that will allow them to reach  the goals that were once not meant for them.  Sadker and Sadker have done  an excellent job in demonstrating another facet of accountability that  teachers must embrace-that of demonstrating and practicing gender equity in  the classroom 
 In Sophie's Choice, William Styron does a masterful job of telling a horrific tale in bearable way.  Sophie is a Polish Christian who survived 18 months in Auschwitz before the camp was liberated by the Allies.  Of course her story is heartbreaking.   But Styron unfolds the tale in a way that allows the reader to take it all in without being crushed by the sadness of it.    First, instead of marching out the story of Sophie's capture and imprisonment in chronological order, Styron layers it on, each layer building on the next.  When the 22-year-old narrator, Stingo, a Southerner who moved to Brooklyn to write novels, first meets Sophie in the summer of 1947, she gives him only the briefest of versions of her experience in the war.  It is only as they grow closer as friends that Sophie, through a series of drunken encounters, provides more details to Stingo, each time admitting that she had lied to him before in earlier versions of her tale.   By presenting the horrifying particulars bit by bit, Styron seems mindful of the warning, and even quotes Stalin as saying, that a "single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic."  The reader sees the tragedy of Sophie's experience because, by offering just a little at a time, Styron allows the reader to digest her story, along with a great deal of information about the Holocaust in general.  If Styron had presented her story in full from the beginning, the awfulness would be numbing.    Also, Styron balances Sophie's tragic past with her tragic present in Brooklyn.  In love with Nathan, a brilliant drug addict subject to violent fits of jealousy, Sophie has no chance of building a "normal" life in America.  But, given her experiences in the concentration camp, it is impossible to imagine how she could.  Rather than present an unbelievable fairy tale of survival, Styron uses the tortured relationship between Nathan and Sophie as the catalyst for her revelations to Stingo, as well as the vehicle of her ultimate, and well-foreshadowed, undoing.  Finally, for all its sadness, there is plenty of humor in the book.  Some of Stingo's failed romantic adventures are downright funny, as are his self-deprecating descriptions of his writing efforts.  Again, without these side stories offering a respite from the main narrative, Sophie's story would be unbearable.  Sophie's Choice is going in my Top 10 favorite novels of all times.  I don't know yet what it is bumping off the list, but it is definitely going on.   
 I really enjoyed this book, very informative in easy to understand terms. great for those just starting out 
 My four year old's nursery school class had been reading this book and he would come home reciting the Tikki Tikki's big long name.  Since I was curious about what he was talking about, we went to the library - and it was such a hit with both the four year old and his two year old brother, I ordered it from Amazon.  I had never heard of this book before; I highly recommend it.  The boys just love it.  It did take a day longer to get here than it should have - which is unusual for amazon.  They are normally pretty prompt.  Overall we are very pleased with the product.  
   I haven't yet gained the courage to give any special comment to any of the Shakespeares. But I'm now going to embark on the second hardest path: to say anything meaningful of Cervantes.     Cervantes is the creator of much, and if I tell you that I believe he has, alongisde to the Bible and Shakespeare, created the Western consciousness (here confess being heavily influenced by Bloom)  I think you might get an idea of how much I respect the man and his work. And then I'm interested in something I call narrative introspection, which is basically a personal transmogrification of other theories of self-consciousness and self-reference in storytelling. If nothing else, I'm going to shed some light on this subject.     It feels daunting to write anything about Don Quijote, because like Hamlet, he seems to have usurped our culture in such a way that they're simply larger than the limits we know. They've been shaping our literary culture in such a profound way it's almost impossible to either approach them or given any new insight into them. That is, this comment doesn't pretend to be important in any way. And because in every instance I make clear that Bloom is an important influence in my ways of reading, I'll paraphrase him as he talks about the paradigm of how poets can't be Adams in the early morning; that there've been too many Adams that have already named everything. We simply approach wisdom and wit greater than ours, whatever we do. This is, in fact, a nicely and healthily humble way of approach Cervantes. He is one of the few Adams I can tell who have been naming everything for us.      The Introspective Narrative. So let's begin by talking about the introspective narrative. This is a term that simply refers to the self-conscious nature of narrative. If you know your Quijote, you already know exactly the things I refer to. Tristram Shandy is like this. Bulgakov, Joyce, Proust, Borges, Saramago, all of them and many more. This happens when a book is openly a book, and many times a book about books. Quijote is to me the epitome of this approach to literature, as in here the whole structure is astonishingly complicated. So complicated, in fact, that not many modern books can match this.     First, we have a book that Cervantes, the narrator, claims to have in his possession. This book is arguably written in Arabic, of which the humble narrator merely makes a translation. An interesting detail is that in Islamic countries any translation of the Qu'ran is treated only as an interpretation. If we select an approach like this it already adds another layer to the story: that what we get is not only a translation, it's an interpretation of the original. Then we have the story itself, that of an elderly man living in the villa of La Mancha, interested in romances of chivalry. What happens is like from a dream come true: the reality of this elderly man mixes with the reality (or should we say 'fiction') of the romances in a way that creates a character called Don Quijote (I rather use this spelling over Quixote) who starts to live this chivarly fiction. What happens is something unique in works that were to come: a shift of reality, where we can view both realities, occurs not mechanically but organically through the most genius device: Quijote starts to enchant Sancho Panza, who starts believing his master's fiction. Sancho is the centre of all the different kind of shifts, as there are some obvious things he recongizes as fiction, yet some he believes. And then there are stories told throughout and some of these mesh with the 'reality' we're attached to, that of Quijote/Pancha.     The latter volume takes this further. If you don't already know, there was an imitation-Cervantes publishing an alleged second part to Don Quijote. Cervantes himself addresses this in the preface, but takes it further by inserting that book into the reality of Don Quijote: Quijote, who of course is a 'fictional' character in his own world, finds out that there is a book of a hidalgo named Don Quijote that has been published and getting some widespread attention. Characters move from layer to layer, and characters that are fictional to our Sancho and company suddenly emerge in the same layer as do our heroes.     It shouldn't be that surprising that such introspection is natural and extremely organically handled in Spanish-language (or Portuguese) literature, and now cinema. Borges, an Argentine, is a literary giant who dedicated much of writings to ideas like this; Saramago, perhaps the greatest living writer alongside Harold Pinter, does the same yet with a synthesis that's highly unpredictable and shrouded into the wafflings of the narrator, as in "The Gospel According to Jesus Christ" and "Stone Raft". Gabriel García Marquez helped to create a re-emerging literary genre with his magical realism, a sort of an anti-thesis to the `artificial', that is, provocative self-reference of the works like Tristram Shandy. In cinema Julio Medem and others (Almodóvar, Cuarón, Iñárritu) are rewriting the ways in which you show narrative visually.        The Style of Cervantes: Irony & Self-Reference. The gamut of Cervantes' ironic flare is distinguishably excessive, erratic in a sophisticated way that's comparable to only that of Shakespeare or Chaucer. This is the funniest book, especially if you're into the whole self-reference thing. There is constant punning and sublime irony. Only Bulgakov is as radically and deliciously grotesque with his irony, making him the decendant of Cervantes, just as Douglas Adams could be the descendant of Lewis Carroll. The second part is more unified, but it lacks the fervent humour. But there the irony becomes organically a part of the shifting layers, and this is the birth of a kind of layered irony, where the layers themselves comment on each in an ironic way.     I haven't read Cervantes in English so I can't comment on the translation. I know it in the original Spanish and Finnish, my native language, in which we have an excellently ironic translation available. Yet if you're looking for an edition in the original Spanish, this is worthy; this is the 400th anniversary Real Academia edition I'm talking about. It has editorial insight, yet what it preserves is the beauty of Cervantes' language. Modern Spanish meanings of difficult words to comprehend are given in annotation. I've been reading this with the Finnish translation, then by itself, and it's a profound experience. And I'm really not the right person to brag about his Spanish. But this is a great edition to strengthen both your Spanish and read the great genius in his own, familiar language.      The edition itself is a hefty book, almost 1,400 pages. The paper's thin, yet the text remains readable. Of all the introducing writings, Mario Vargas Llosa's "Una novela para el siglo XXI' is the most vividly written. Also included are Francisco Ayala's "La Invención del `Quijote'" and Martín de Riquer's "Cervantes y el `Quijote'". Notes on the text are provided in summary by Francisco Rico. A glossary of words is also provided in the end of the book. Very useful, very well thought out.     A treasure of a book 
 Even if you've been graphing for decades or are a scientific or statistical sophisticate, this book is more valuable than you'd guess.  You may know some stuff to help make your graphing better, but I bet there are many more principles, features, and techniques you simply never thought of.  This book has these.  But for even more incisive visualizations, you should get also Cleveland's "Visualizing Data".  You'll need both books really. (There's not much overlap.) Even though making use of graphical perception principles increases the power of your graphs (the main topic of "Elements of Graphing Data"), there are even more incisive graph types you need to learn about; only a couple of these are in "Elements"; the others are in "Visualizing Data".  After digesting Cleveland's two books, you will be a master data-behaviour elucidator.  Once in a great while you may need the old statistical inference paradigm (test-statistics & p-values), but much more often you will be so glad you have the power of Cleveland's visualization paradigm to use instead.  But again, you will need both "Elements of Graphing Data" and "Visualizing Data".  Start with "Elements" though.  The book reads easily, is interesting and has a bonus for those into perceptual psychology.  A neato tidbit:  the author's research results on graphical perception were given in part as graphs -- leading to the nifty "the medium is the message" thing.  No matter what aspect of "Elements" you look at, it is simply marvelous -- all substance, and several points (not just a single point for a whole book like Tufte did in his book) 
 This is one of the most SOULFUL CD's on the market for us 70's children.  Teach Me How to Love is one of the most beautiful love songs ever written that never get ANY air play! I am a collector of 70's Soul music and trust me you will love this is you like/remember Black Ivory, Blue Magic, The Moments, The Ebonys and the Intruders (for you serious oldies lovers). Buy it 
 In one touching scene at the airport, Lisa (Rachel McAdams) gets a caffe latte spilled all across her business suit so she takes to the ladies room where, trying to mop up her jacket, she looks in the mirror and once again notices a disfiguring scar along her sternum, really looked more like an ugly scratch with blood mounting behind it.  Now whatever happened to that?  Did the screenwriters ever write in an explanation for this, or was it just to make you feel sorry for Lisa?  I kept waiting for the other shoe to fall, for her to explain that she feels stronger since her tracheotomy (or whatever it was), and that's why she won't take any more guff from international terrorists.  She is so beautiful, you can't take your eyes off of her, and certainly those who question why such a young woman has such an important job at the hotel, well, a, of course she does, and b, on the other hand, is her job as important as all that?  She just seems to be some sort of glorified customer service flunky, making sure everyone gets mints on their pillow.  It's not like she's a brain surgeon.  OK, I was the first one to yelp when Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist Lois Lane was played by Kate Bosworth, who looks all of 16, in the recent SUPERMAN RETURNS.  But indeed I think Rachel McAdams is ideally cast.  Bottom line, of course, she can do nothing wrong.  She could have played her own father too, and I would have been nodding my head, remarking for the 1000th time, she is so admirably versatile!  It's Cillian Murphy who seems stuck in a rut, first BATMAN BEGINS, then this, which is the same part, except, not as scary.  What will he play next, someone of the same ilk who actually doesn't commit any crimes?  Or mild ones, like jaywalking or not rewinding videotapes?  Well, if Rachel McAdams is in it, I'm there.  Looked like they had Brian Cox for one afternoon and managed to film all his scenes in rapid succession, thereby freeing him up for his eleven other 2005 releases.  You got to hand it to the man, he's everywhere, like brie 
 Age of Gold is an amazing overview of the California Gold Rush. Brands takes individual characters who experienced the Rush firsthand and maps out the rapid birth of California through their experiences. This is a quick and educational read, I recommend it to every historian. 5 out of 5 stars 
 The Girls is one of the most amazing books I have read recently.  A topic that sounds unappealing turns into a most engrossing and amusing tale.  A book that you just don't want to end.  Highly recommended 
 The books in this trilogy get better as you go. Eye in the Door certainly explores the dissolving bonds of society in war time but Ghost Road seems to move the theme even further into the primitive societal meaning of war.  In Regeneration, Siefried Sassoon must find personal meaning in this horroble meaningless mess called World War I. In Eye in the Door we seen how sexual bonds are losened while society seeks to blame negative events in wartime on homosexuals. Finally in Ghost Road we see war as the sacrifice of the young male to the gods. The upperclass elderly males who direct wars sacrifice the young sons of the working class on an altar of horror. Dr. Rivers makes this connect as he treats the young Billy Pryor for shell shock while remembering the ritual sacrifice of the Melanesian head hunters.  The trilogy is absolutely great and should be read in order to follow the character developement as well as the exploration of war that Barker develops differently with each book. 
 This is one terrific book.  Layer upon layer, MCS created memorable settings and characters, as well as an exciting mystery.  Martin Cruz Smith is one of the finest writers of fiction, and his works are true literature 
 In the early pages of So Big we learn that So Big is the nickname of Dirk DeJong, a young man who has long outgrown the childhood name from his mother, Selina. At this point I figure that the novel would be about the title character, but So Big is really about his mother Selina. Selina takes a job as smalltown schoolteacher in Illinois knowing that in two years she will be eligible to work in a city school and be better paid (the novel is set in the late 1800's). In High Prairie Selina finds out that she is nothing like the hardworking and hard lives of the farmers and farming families of the town. High Prairie is an education for her and when she surprisingly marries one of the farmers her life is ultimately linked to the town and the farming life, one which she never would have anticipated. She hopes, of course, for a better life for her son and struggles to do the best she can for him.  So Big won the 1924 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and is a fine novel of argrarian literature. Edna Ferber does well in capturing the hard lives of the farmers without either idealizing their struggle nor demeaning their lives. Literature of this sort (such as A Thousand Acres, which also won the Pulitzer) is strangely appealing to me since I have no real ties to the farming life and have never worked on a farm, but when written well it comes across with great passion and compassion in a novel.  -Joe Sherr 
 I first heard of David Kunzle's book through a review written by Angela Carter.  The book puts forward what was a novel argument at the time it was written - namely, that use of the corset and tightlacing was not simply a sign of the social oppression of women, but that it was simulataneously a rebellion against that oppression.  Particularly focussing on the Victorian era, he argues that use of the corset was subversive, in view of the socially sanctioned role for women as sexless 'angels in the house' - tightlacing being overtly sexual, and not seen as consistent with housewifely duties.  He marshals an impressive array of data in support of this thesis, particularly from the vehement anti-feminist opposition.  Fascinating social history - highly recommended 
 Having taught this book several times as an English teacher, I've certainly had my exposure to it.  My view of the novel has certainly changed over time, as I've come to regard the novel for all of its beauty.  I strike a single star from its score simply because I don't believe the book has aged well; it is not accessible and applicable to contemporary America like it was to the generation of adolescents who could still remember that there was such a thing as World War II and that it wasn't almost as long ago as Noah's flood.  To today's teenagers, it comes across as cheesy.  This is truly a shame, suggesting we have reached a period in history in which the naivetï¿½ of youth has been obliterated.  But then, that is what the novel is about, and perhaps it has grown even more meaningful today.  Instead of reading this text as a commentary on individual maturation and the rites of passage associated with it, A Separate Peace must be viewed as a commentary on the development of Modern America, a country that has grown much like Gene, made mistakes like Gene, and has come to realize a state of experience and worldliness that is a far cry from its origins.  The value of Knowles' novel lies, moreover, in its accessibility as an instructional tool.  His use of metaphor and symbolism yields easy discussion to the work's major themes and concepts.  It lacks scope in the its single-minded attention to Caucasian males does not lend itself toward all classrooms, ethnicities, or school districts, but for those two whom it may hold some relevance, there is a great deal to learn from it.  A Separate Peace shows ordinary teenagers encountering and engaging in the same foibles I see my students make on a daily basis.  There is something about Gene that is ubiquitous in all of us, and there is much that can be derived from his narrative.   
 I had a bulging disk problem many years ago but had recovered. Recently I had my first serious flair up, and for two weeks none of my standard exercises worked.   I got Dr. Root's book, and his exercises immediately started helping. One particular cross-legged exercise helped realign my back so that the other exercises could be more productive.   Without this book, I would have had to go back to the doctor and get his help because I was getting desperate. Now I'm on my way to recovery, and I'll be sure to keep doing Dr. Root's exercises so they'll keep my back in shape

 When I first read this book, I hurt myself laughing.  Then, because I'm evil, I gave it to my family and listened while they laughed themselves sick.  If you know the songs of the '50s and '60s, this book is guaranteed to make you laugh.  I'm an aging boomer and there is no better birthday gift for all my equally aging friends.  
 Not only is the cookbook photographed wonderfully, the contents are substantive and the reader learns from Portale.  I've made 10 dishes from this cookbook, all of them crowd-pleasers.  I would have made more by now,  but I kept forgetting to look at this book.  I especially love his seafood  recipes.  This chef doesn't get much national attention, but he's right up  there with Boulud and Waters 
 This sequel to the TALENTED MR. RIPPLEY is just as exciting and suspencful as the the first book.  Actually, I read it to find out what happend next after the movie ended, but the book does not serve that purpose.  The movie added a kind of cliff-hanger ending that doesn't exist in the TALENTED MR. RIPPLEY book, so the second book won't fill the reader in on that.  This book begins a new adventure and series of murders that are equally as gripping as the first book.  Readers wondering about he future of Tom's gay life will be disappointed as he is married now, but the author drops a few interesting tid-bits towards the subject of Tom's sexual orientation.  Mostly the focus is on Tom's constantly having to get out of serious jams that could send him to prision for life.  I loved every page of it and can't wait to read the rest of the series 
 Once again Rebecca Bloomwood plunges through life thinking she will never reach the limits on her credit cards, never get caught in all those "little white lies" and believing that her big break is right around the corner.  This time she is in New York, but as before she has the knack of digging herself into a hole and somehow getting out of it again. Funny, but has some wrenching moments as well when she realizes the harm done to her relationship, her job and her prospects. It all works out, of course.  I'll be very sorry when I've run through all Kinsella's books. They are lots of fun 
 This is number 11 in the Sano Ichiro series, set in Japan in 1698--the world of shoguns, samurai, and martial arts.  Hirata, now the shogun's special investigator, comes to the home of Lord Mori, to interrogate him because he has been accused of treason. Instead Hirata discovers him dead, with a naked, blood-spattered, pregnant woman in a stupor near him. She is Reiko, the wife of his boss, Sano Ichiro, now Chamberlain.  Enemies of Reiko (an investigator in her own right) and Sano are busy plotting their downfall, but who set up the elaborate scene? Sano and Reiko must rush to find the solution before their time is up, and they are tried and executed for murder and treason.  Potential witnesses are murdered right and left, and conspiracies abound. There are many trails to follow. Lord Mori was interested in young boys, even his stepson; and his wife hated him for this abuse of her child. Police Commissioner Hoshina, corrupt and nasty, may be involved in the treason plot. Was he involved in Mori's death?  Rowland creates a realistic and believable world with intriguing characters that are able to navigate the difficult shoals of political intrigue, personal integrity, and loyalty in a very stratified, violent and constricting society.  Armchair Interviews says: Over 300-year old Japanese setting makes for unique location for a mystery 
 A good source of data for those who want to know how the Industry of Computers began. If you want to understand why the Computer Science changed the world, and if youd like to speak as an expert in all those fantastic  words of the luckiest people on the 50s, 60s, 70s and even the 80s who  had the opportunity to grow and deal with this technology, and feel how  these people had to accept new windows-know-it-all-users with little or  none at all knowledge about programming and other related training and  long-time-consuming-hard-to-learn skills, you must read this book. Then,  Im sure, youll know what I mean 
 This book is one of Agatha Christie's greatest thrillers of all.  I couldn't stop reading it. Once i thought i knew what would happen something what i totally didn't expect happened. This book shows the eccentric character of Christie's creative and skeemy, Hercule Poirot and how he intelligently and cunningly comes up with a solution to this case that had baffled all others.  Agatha Christie's talent and ability as a wonderful writer shines in this book with unexpected twists and turns of plot 
 I am amazed at the sort of complex storytelling that Ms. Minarik can accomplish with fairly simple words.  [Why can't more modern authors accomplish the same?!?]  In this book, Little Bear finds two new friends, a little girl named Emily and her doll, Lucy.  Together they have adventures which include going to a party, a broken arm for Lucy, and tragedy of tragedies... Emily's having to go away at the end of summer to attend school.  Five Stars.  Wonderful storytelling.  Good Read-aloud.  I would estimate that this "I Can Read" book is on the first grade level.  [Other sources list it as a second grade reader: 2.2  Level.]  Principally the difficulty lies not in the vocabulary but in the fact that there is quite a bit of dialog and more words per page than is found in Ms. Minarik's earlier stories. 
 This product was better than I expected. The quality and color were great

 Author Debra A. Benton discusses how chief executive officers succeed. She bases her information on interviews with hundreds of major corporations' CEOs and with well-known leaders and public figures. The experiences of so many CEOs make the book fascinating. Readers will be intrigued by the many success stories. Benton also extrapolates and explains the key principles behind the success of these executives. The book is an excellent, well-written guide that includes some well-known success principles and some that may be less well-known. The short, snappy, easy-to-read style is accessible. A helpful summary at the end of each chapter captures the major principles covered. We at getAbstract recommend this book to those on the way up in management, those interested in getting into management, and those who wish to apply these principles of success in their own careers 
 This summary is very useful; it will increase your understanding of torts as well as your exam scores.  It is organized quite well and is easy to read.  The numberous charts are very helpful when time is short 
 I often lamented the fact that there was no brainwave CD out there that induces gamma waves and I was very excited when I found this product.   This CD was very effective in opening my "spiritual center" (which is located in the forehead and on top of the head) and I was able to reach a highly inspired state of clarity and perception.   If you are into Eastern Mysticism or Western Magick then I highly recommend this product as it is an excellent suppliment to those who practice meditation or magickal rites. The gamma state of awareness is in fact Divine Consciousness, and does improve various abilities such as meditation, rune and tarot readings, achieving a state of "gnosis", or anything that allows one to access mystical experiences.   These experiences are not fake or trivial and are very, very real. The most notable effect is that of "binding", in which the pool of data stored in your brain becomes synthesized into a coherent whole, which is the very definition of "genius". This deep mystical experience is called many things; "samadhi", "gnosis", and "vita" to name a few, and all of these things were known by the Anceints LONG before these processes were "discovered" by scientists who explore the psychology feild.  I will not recommend this product to those who are not interested in spiritual developement or self actualisation.......it will do you no good, in fact it may even be detrimental and destructive to those who choose to be ignorant to themselves or the world around them, especially if one is only looking for a "way out" experience. 
 I used to hate Carver.  "Nothing happens in these stories!" I would say.  "What does it MEAN, for God's sake?!"  It took me a while to realise that Carver's genius isn't for the grand epiphany, the convoluted plot, or the surprise ending.  His genius is for moments of pathos; for moments of carefully observed humanity; for human foibles unflinchingly, but never unkindly, revealed.  You really have to read him for yourself to understand, but here's an example: the story "Gazebo", which is one of my favourites from this collection.  The story works because what 'the gazebo' means to the couple in the story is something most of us have felt: a dream of future happiness that is now lost to us; lost because we don't see how we might escape the banality of our own lives; lost because we fail to see how close we are to achieving it, if only we could slightly change the way we see things, or the way we live.  None of this is overtly stated in the story - and that's Carver's genius.  It is simply implied by juxtaposition.  Thematic statements and grand epiphanies undermine so many stories (even some of Carver's earlier ones) because they are embarrassing.  I don't mean embarrassing for the writer, I mean embarrassing for us, the readers: to have these slightly pathetic, vaguely shameful, and yet very human moments which are recognisably our own shoved in our faces feels like an accusation, and one we understandably reject.  But to have them placed before us, gently, apparently undeliberately, so that we might see them for ourselves is wonderful.  It engages OUR powers of observation and reflection, not just the writer's.  We see ourselves reflected there in the story, and it's a private moment of self-revelation, of self-understanding.  And more often than not, this is NOT a life-changing experience for us.  No, the effect is much simpler, more realistic and more honest.  It's a feeling of: "Oh, thank God.  Other people feel this way, too.  I'm not alone."  It's a moment of empathy, not of explanation.  Carver gives us this gift many times, and so well.  Go read everything he's written.  Especially if you're interested in writing your own stories.  Carver's small body of work has as much to teach us about writing as it does about our lives 
 Thank you very much for the book. It was in good condition and i have been able to study from it 
 Great music.  Makes you want to get up and dance - or sing - or both.  Filming in a New York winter helps to really bring you into their angst.  I loved it

 I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and as great an actor as Morgan Freeman is, he is terribly mis-cast as Alex Cross.  Cross is described as a 40 year old Muhammad Ali look alike.  Not even close.  Of course, there is the part in the movie that they kill off a character that appears in a later novel.  Maybe it was all a dream as it was for a whole season of "Dallas".  As with most books made into movies, something is missing.  I think what is missing is the screen writers reading the whole book.    All that said, I did enjoy the movie.  There are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained 
 Any history of finance and entrepreneurs is incomplete without noting the paramount character of Jay Gould.  However, few unbiased writings exist on the life of the so-called "Dark Genius".  Gould was painted as the Ty Cobb of business - a talented master of the game, but also a vilified character held in contempt by his contemporaries.  Renehan strips away the years of misinterpretation and provides his readers with an honest look at a man who deserves our attention.  Business is not a place for the timid.  If it were then we would live in a drastically different and in my view a deplorable state of affairs.  Gould took an ambitious and aggressive posture in his dealings, and by so doing helped build the industrial might of early 20th century America.  Furthermore, much of the financial wizardry that we take for granted today originated in the creative thought of Gould.  This book is an absolute must for anyone seeking to understanding business.    
 I love this movie. For my 15th Birthday, My mom ordered it for me:) The Video Store lost the order and it took them 6 months to get it to me on VHS. Does that tell you how long I have loved this movie!!! I know the movie word for word!! Most Men do not understand it, (it has no action, DUH!!). It does not need it! It is beautifully written and the background (Italy, etc.) is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!! I have a wonderful dream to fufill on day - To run through a barley & poppy field dressed in  a victorian dress and carring a parasol:) I love the way Helena says the word Constantinople. It will be my daughter's name. Also the costumes and Hair in the movie is incredable!! For my wedding I had the hair of the Italian driver's girlfriend. I am a long haired blond, so it worked out perfectly. Helena still and always will be my favorite British Actress. This movie moved my in many ways and I even after almost 15 years nothing compares to this movie in my opinion!!  Enjoy!!!! If you are a romantic at heart let the romance take you away for a few hours: 
 An eclectic mix of artists is what make up the lineup for The Crow: City of Angels soundtrack, but those looking for the same type of remorseful, atmosphere driven songs that made up the first soundtrack will find a testosterone driven mix of songs here.  Hole covers Fleetwood Mac's "Gold Dust Woman" and the cover is surprisingly good and makes Hole actually sound like a talented band.  White Zombie offers a cover of KC & The Sunshine Band's "I'm Your Boogieman", one of WZ's last tracks recorded before their breakup.  Filter's pre-"Title of Record" song "Jurassitol" is solid, and proof the band once actually rocked.  Bush's rather depressing "In a Lonely Place" sounds like a throw away track, and Iggy Pop (who was also in the film) offers a live version of "I Wanna Be Your Dog" which adds a nice edge to the album.  Korn and the Deftones offer "Sean Olsen" and "Teething" respectively, both of whom making appearences here before they got big, although I found Korn's song rather repetitive.  However, Tricky & The Gravediggaz "Tonite is a Special Night" and Above the Law & Frost's "City of Angels" seem so out of place its not even funny.  All in all, the good pretty much outweighs the bad, and at least its better than The Crow: Salvation soundtrack 
 Honestly, I've never been into the contemporary rap/hip hop world, which is full of hatred, violence and foul sex. This is the first rap cd I've ever bought in my whole life. I first listened to "dear slim pt 2" on MusicMatch and fell in love with this guy's music and decided to buy this album. This album is not like anything I've ever heard before. Songs like "Back in the day" or "47 pop stars" are very funny and show that Kj has a great talent with playing with words. "Check youself" is pretty similar with his later work "For the ladies" from his following album "Behind the musik" (and also has the same message as Will Smith's song "Pump Ya brakes"). And my favorite "#1 Fan", the best song ever made buy Kj even though it may not be true.  Check out his later work "Behind the Musik", it's even better than this album. Keep on the great work, Kj!!!Keep on representing God in your songs no matter what people say. One day they'll see that cursing and writing stupid verses will lead them nowhere. "To gain a world of fan, but suffer loss of soul" 
 I gave it 5 stars because, as is usually true of Grisham, it's well written and the story is gripping. However, it made me feel very anxious....there but for the grace of God go I....and angry. You wonder how this possibly could have happened, how people could be so blind and one-track-minded. It's not a feel good read but it certainly opens your eyes 
 Wow!  I have read a few Grisham books, and I have to say that this is the best one I have read thus far.  He drags you in very quickly with Mitch, the main protagonist in the story.  He tells about this background and the sudden riches he has.  He seems to have it all:  a great job, a beautiful wife, a nice home, a great car, and living in a wonderful city.  Only one problem.  He finds out later how unsavory his employer is.  Caught between the law and his employer, he has to find a way out.  While the ending is rather implausible, it does show some creativity.  It had me hanging on until the end.  In fact, I stayed up after the rest of the family had gone to bed because there was no way I could leave this novel sitting for the night with the last 25 pages unread.  If you like Grisham's other novels, this one will be an absolute delight 
 The title of my review basically tells exactly how I feel about this work. The writing (and the translation) is simply beautiful, and it's of such a length that it will take about 2 hours of your time to read. These 2 hours will not be wasted, I assure you, for you will read words written by a modern master of literature. The plot is quite simple, and often not even necessary, for the language and the writing carries this book from beginning to end. I only wish that the book were longer so that I could spend more time with a very delightful elderly man 
 This CD, combined with my seeing the trio last week at the Village Vanguard, confirms in my mind that Mehldau is the strongest, most creative pianist in Jazz today.  One might think that the consistent stream of "Art of the Trio" releases would get tiresome, but Mehldau and his group have revealed new ideas on every album.  His reharmonizations of standards like The More I See You and Alone Together are ingenious, and his ballads are haunting and soulful.  Mehldau was even better a year later, at his recent Vanguard date, and I look forward to volume 6 
 "Welcome to paradise. And the name's Dante!"  So begins Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric's harrowing adventure about the Seaborne Legend. The beautiful ship, friendly passengers, and attentive crew would ordinarily make a splendid cruise. Unfortunately, among the passengers is a madman who is bent on ruining everyone's vacation.  Though it would appear this film is not universally well-loved, it is actually one of my favorite action moves. I enjoyed the main setting: a cruise ship. The passengers are very funny. Among them are a couple who are selling a new diet regimen called Fat Busters, where "fat is your friend" (so the body won't try to hoard fat, making weight loss difficult). Their fellow shipmates, surrounded by the cruise ship's banquet-like meal, heartily agree. And the deaf girl who signs is wonderful.  The villain is entertaining. (Admittedly, the story behind his motivation to destroy the ship may be rather contrived.)  The action moves from the ocean-liner, to speedboat, to personal water-craft, to a propeller aircraft, then finally to a tower high atop an oil tanker. (If you've ever wondered what it would look like to see an oil tanker blow up, your curiosity will be satisfied by what happens next.)  In all, this movie is a little like a trip to an amusement park. There is lots of action in this movie, and no small amount of comedy 
 Nice review! ....... I just wanted to correct you on a minor mistake:  "Cook With Honey" was actually a Top 40 hit (it reached #32 in  1973). In retrospect of my previous review I would like to say that the  song is indeed my favorite (if I had to chose one) from this album. I also  feel that it is THE essential Collins album if one had to be chosen. God,  what was I thinking giving this 4 stars?????!!!!! Oh well, I was young and  foolish .. 
 This is my all time favorite book! I have never found myself going through so many different emotions while reading one book. It is definately one of Nicholas Sparks bests 
 Proust's great novel does not need to be read all at one time.  I read it one volume at a time and usually took six months to a year off between volumes. I was always able to pick up right where I left off with nothing lost, like visiting old friends. I think it is OK to think of Remembrance of Things Past as a series of novels.  I know Proust would disagree with this.  It was very important to him that his readers consider carefully the unifying theme and symmetry to which he aspired in the novel, but I think that aspect became less and less tangible as his manuscript grew from 1000 pages originally to 2000, and then from 2000 to the 4000 odd pages it ended up being (he continued to expand the manuscript right up until the time of his death). In any event, the grand theme he designed will not be lost on you if you stay with the novel until the end and it is wonderful when you consider it, but it is not the reason I love the novel so well.  Swann's Way, Within a Budding Grove, and The Guermantes Way are decisively the best volumes and, fortunately, they are the first three in that order. If you like Swann's Way but are intimidated by the gargantuan size of the entire series, then plan to read at least the first three volumes.  In this way you will have experienced Proust's best material. The entire novel is essentially a fictional autobiography or memoir.  It is narrated by a man whose name we are never given, although he does hypothetically suggest the name "Marcel" for himself on one occasion about three-fourths of the way through.  The story is inspired by events and people from Proust's life, but it is strictly a fiction. Swann's Way is the only volume in which the narrator is not the central figure in the story.  It is, ultimately, a conventional story with several fascinating characters and humorous, razor sharp dialogue. There are several recurring, ingeniously depicted themes in the novel, not the least of which is involuntary memory, and it often reads like a deeply philosophical essay, with Proust wandering off on one of his famous digressions.  The philosophical digressions are the best part for me, but I could see why they could be distracting or tedious to some. Proust's sentences quite frequently stretch to 10, 20, or even 30 lines, with multiple subordinating clauses.  It can be dizzying. Some have claimed that this makes him a stream-of-consciousness writer. I flat out reject this notion. It is never, ever pretentious or unnecessarily wordy.  Literary historians love to bracket Proust in the same category as Joyce (like art historians like to couple, for example, Van Gough and Gauguin), but the two writers are as different as night and day.  Every sentence is worth the time in Proust, there are no word games, there is no obscurity, and it is all essential and rewarding.  The only complaint I have is that he spends too much time on the theme of jealousy in the later volumes, a theme he covered quite well in Swann's way.  Those volumes are worth reading too, but they have a tendency to drag out in a way that the first three volumes don't. Things do pick up a bit with the final volume, Time Regained, where everything comes full circle 
 People kill each other over the dumbest things. You might think that the reason for the carnage in SUICIDE SQUEEZE, Victor Gischler's third and latest novel, is absurd. The motivation behind everything (well, almost everything) that takes place here is the acquisition of...a baseball card. It's not just any baseball card, though. It's a 1954 Joe DiMaggio card, autographed by Mr. Coffee himself, and the actress he was married to at the time, a starlet named Marilyn Monroe. Oh, by the way, there is a third signature on the card, that belonging to movie director Billy Wilder. There may have been a lot of Joltin' Joe DiMaggio cards printed, but one having those three signatures on it is truly one of a kind. Would people kill for a card like that? Yes. They would.  As you might expect, such a card is well beyond the reach of your average trading card fan, the kid with the dirty t-shirt and the dirty five-dollar bill who refuses to change either one. In SUICIDE SQUEEZE, however, the card has attracted the attention of Ahira Kurisaka, an unscrupulous and extremely wealthy businessman who wants the card and is willing to pay any price, and do anything, to get it. The owner of the prized possession is Teddy Folger, who used the valuable card as part of an insurance scam to fly the coup on his obligations to his ex-wife and everyone else within grabbing distance of him. Folger claimed that the card was destroyed in a fire, collected on his insurance policy, and got out of Dodge, sailing on a leased yacht on which he has no intentions of making payments. He of course still has the card and is looking to clandestinely sell it to the highest bidder.  Enter Conner Samson, a down-on-his-luck repo man who is retained by the rightful owner of the boat for the express purpose of getting it back. Samson gets to Folger about the same time that Kurisaka's representatives do, only he's a step or three behind. Samson gets the yacht, and Kurisaka's hirelings think he also has the card. Throw one of Samson's past due gambling debts, and a polite but firm collector, into the mix, and you have a "suicide squeeze."  Although Gischler is only three books into a brilliant career, he has thoroughly mastered the ability, as demonstrated in this novel, to present a complex plot without losing the reader in the narrative. Gischler's characters are quirky but believable, and his sense of humor keeps the plot afloat rather than miring it in absurdity. One quick example is a scene wherein Samson attends a science fiction convention. Gischler nails everything --- the generic hotel, the merch dealers, and most importantly, the crowd --- with just a few sentences that will leave you howling and at the same time humbled.  Incidentally, Gischler knows his stuff as well (I have my first Byrne X-Men issue under lock and key, too!) and as a result you can't read SUICIDE SQUEEZE without picking up a nugget or two of arcane knowledge along the way. Best of all, it is a fast, fun read. You can't ask for much more than that.     --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub 
 I loved The Women of Brewster Place. I thought that Gloria Naylor did a wonderful job introducing a host of characters, that we all grew to love. We learn how each character's secrets have driven them to the same location....Brewster Place.  We have a mother who loved too much. A lesbian who moved from place to place to find acceptance. A drunk who misses his daughter. A wealthy girl who is stuggling for acceptance on her own terms. A neighbor who is too busy being a busy body to accept. A woman who looses her daughter to an accident that leaves her reeling.  We learn about all of their loves, fears, and heartaches.   I think Naylor does a wonderful job at setting the tone that "something" has to change in each of their lives and creates an atmosphere that you know change is coming. This powerful novel ends with the tearing down of the walls that hold its residents hostage, both figuratively and literally.  
 This is an absolutely wonderful cookbook, perfect for those who love California cuisine or for anyone who wants to introduce some variety into their nightly menus.  Every recipe I've tried so far has been fantastic.  I've recently fallen in love with the soup section in particular...the Three Onion Soup is a delicious twist on the traditional French recipe, and the Zucchini Soup is even better 
 This book is what "Home Recording for Dummies" should be.  It gives a very good overview of the components of a modern amateur recording studio.  I would recommend it over anything in the "Idiot's" or "Dummies" series by far.  Excellent color pictures and diagrams, well layed-out information, equipment and software recommendations, recording techniques, and price guides are all excellent reasons to buy this book.  The only reason I gave it 4/5 was because the book has a little difficulty tying all the pieces of a home studio together into one package.  While the book gave excellent descriptions of the components of a home studio, it didn't tie them together extremely well.  The book deals almost exclusively with computer-based recording, with slight mention to tape-based recording.  It's unbiased between Mac and PC, but the software recommendations are dated to 2004/2005.  However, most everything else in this book should be good information to have for years to come

I can't guarantee it for you, but with my life experience the author's depiction of how clairvoyants see our thoughts and spirits acting seems very true. Probably the best book I own on the occult, believe it or not, the statements made with images are profound. If you have any tendency towards being a mystic this book will give you a charge, the content will connect 
 I remember going to my grandmother's home and insisting on playing my "Flying Nun" album  on her stereo unit in the sun room. I know she got so tired of hearing that album but I would play it over and over! Alright, let's face it-the plot is as ridiculous as any plot could be but the series is CUTE and FUN! The storylines far-fetched? YES The special effects?-sure you see the wires (poor Sally explains how painfull the whole ordeal actually was) The series takes you away from the stress and craziness of everyday life, if only for a few moments! The cast was a fantastic group of individuals and the acting was "first-rate" even if the storylines were not! The DVD set is bright and fun. Contains an interesting interview with Sally. She really didn't enjoy doing the series but it doesn't show in her acting. She does have a funny story of her whole ordeal on recording the LP. Purchase this DVD set and you'll be "FLYING" high with laughter. They've just announced Season TWO coming in August-Can't Wait! Now we can enjoy the early work of Sally Field over and over again! Do you think they will ever release the LP on Compact Disc 
 Saturday truly is a novel of our times: It's the story of a day in the life of Henry Perowne, a successful British neurosurgeon. Committed to his work, deeply in love with his wife, and endlessly proud of his grown children, Perowne leads an ordinary, contended, and comfortable life. The novel explores the worries, fears, and concerns of modern life- although written in the third person, the prose creates a sort of detached internal monologue of Perowne's idle thoughts. Descriptions of ordinary daily activities are really jumping-off points for extended meditations on religion, family, music, war, love, fate, science, poetry, and a few billion other subjects. Perowne's introspection- not to mention the ultramodern London in which he lives- is steeped in post-September 11th fear, paranoia, uncertainty, and dread. Considering that the Saturday in question takes place in February of 2003, it's natural that much of Henry's musings regard the threat of war in Iraq. Henry's day is shaped by a variety of ominous instances: A run-in with a mentally-unstable street tough named Baxter, a pre-dawn sighting of a burning airplane making an emergency landing, and a planned reunion with an estranged family member all contribute to the novel's black cloud atmospherics. There's always a sense of tension lurking just beneath the surface, of terrifying and life-altering implications hiding behind a humdrum facade, ready to burst out into the open at any moment. As such, Saturday is a sort of socially conscious emotional thriller, and an attempt to create an ideal snapshot of the world we live in today.  Is it successful? Well, yes and no. On the plus side, Saturday is incredibly atmospheric- McEwan's world is trapped in the churning wake of 9/11, a maze of confusion and fear directed in every direction. An anti-war protest occurring in London becomes just as ominous and omnipresent as the prospect of war itself. What's more, Perowne's musings are often quite interesting: witness his introspective, almost cynically optimistic reflection on terrorism and religion in the first chapter. Perowne's visit to his aging mother leads to an exploration of age, while the last ten pages are a gorgeous rumination on fate and responsibility. McEwan's triumph is his ability to articulate thoughts, emotions, and concerns that everyone seems to have, but that no one seems to express. Perowne becomes a sort of everyman- just like us, he doesn't have the answers to most of the questions that he asks. His shifts from quiet introspection, to unadulterated joy, to bitter self-loathing, and to just about every other place on the emotional and intellectual map evoke sympathy, identification, and a strong liking. It actually made me a bit sad to part ways with the good doctor after I finished the book. But Saturday isn't a complete success: The novel lacks a strong, unifying plot: Characters are introduced and disposed of at awkward, stuttering, intervals. Unlikely twists and turns collide head-on with underdeveloped ideas, meaningless digressions, and a few moments of overindulgent banality. No single plot thread is enough to unify the story: Baxter, the burning plane, and the family reunion drift in and out of focus, fighting for space among descriptions of Perowne buying fish, playing squash, and going through other routines of the day. Even worse are McEwan's anal-retentive and overlong descriptions of brain surgery and musical theory, which are impossible to follow with anything resembling undivided attention. In addition, there are some downright boring sections, and some of Perowne's musing meander a bit too long, or just fall flat.  Still, at its best, Saturday is a haunting and atmospheric snapshot of post-9/11 life. 
 My wife and I are vegan.  She is always trying new recipes, and Robin Robertson's new cookbook, Carb Conscious Vegetarian is perfect for us both.  I love a hearty meal, my wife likes a lighter meal.  Most of these recipes can be made with a serving of pasta, rice, or potatoes on the side, or mixed in, so that both of us can enjoy a healthy, and myself a bit heartier, meal.  For example, the appetizers are great, because my wife will make several of them at one time, and make a side of roasted potatoes along with them (for me) and  that makes a fun meal.  Many of the salads involve a combination of vegetables, tofu, tempeh, etc. to be topped on lettuce leaves.  Instead of putting the "topping" on lettuce as my wife does, I put it over brown rice. The soups and stews are really delicious, but if I need a little more food that night, I will throw in some pasta or tofu cubes or have some bread on the side. The side dishes can be served with roasted potatoes, rice, or pasta.  The entrees are satisfying enough on their own, but sometimes I will still make some garlic bread or pasta on the side, and I'm plenty full. The Breakfast Bites are fine as they are, filling enough for me in the morning. And the Divine Desserts are unbelievably satisfying. This cookbook is really versatile, and works great for that vegetarian or vegan couple or family who enjoy great food, a healthy diet, and love to eat together, even though they are on different diet plans. 
 These are among the final talks that Nisargadatta gave in the last year of his life or so.  In this powerful book of Q & A between teacher and seeker we have some extremely detailed and terse teachings on the Nature of Reality. Nisargadatta's answers cut to the chase and go right to the Heart of the Absolute.  One of the reasons for the sharpness of the teachings is because he is physically suffering due to throat cancer and nevertheless continues to teach throughout his illness (he continued to teach until hours before his physical death). For those that don't know his work too well, what is considered his main work is I AM THAT, which is recommended to begin the study of his teachings, after I AM THAT came a series of about 6 books, all within the last 2 years of his life.  The post I AM THAT books are all uncompromisingly direct and sharp.  He speaks only from realization of the Unborn state and gives all his discources from there, making it tricky to understand for some.  With the combination of being ill and with 42 years of teaching experience at this point, he keeps his talks very focused.   In this great work, we see his expertise in that he doesn't just point to the Absolute reality with a lot of poetic words, he also deconstructs your preciously held self.   He tirelessly breaks down concepts and spiritual ideas we don't want to let go of.  One can say in this work we are privledged to see very "advanced" teachings.  Teachings that will appeal to seekers that can go beyond just pretty ideas of spirituality, bliss out states, any form of personal gain whatsoever (because you're understanding yourself as the Impersonal Reality). He even challenges one particular seeker in this book to leave spirituality because he knows that this particular seeker is caught up being a "spiritual seeker" and isn't ready to go beyond the body-mind sense, he fears death of the personality.  No flowery, superficial hand holding here! The essence of his teachings is: understand your "I am-ness" or consciousness, go deeply into that and awake from your daydream as that body-mind entity you think you are and  apperceive yourself as the Unborn. I felt deeply privledged to read this wonderful book.    "What do you understand by the word dream?  Is not the dream something like a drama, a play?...To one who really understands what has been said here, a dream is no different from what is seen in the waking state: both are plays of consciousness... We call one thing the waking state, another thing the dream, but in essence both are events happening in the consciousness and essentially they are not different."  " When you are liberated from the body/mind sense, so that you are not the body mind, that itself is liberation."<BR Nisargadatta Mahara 
 I am transribing for my son who needs his voice heard. "I thought that Juudy Moody had a bad expereince on the first day of school. I related to the school part, as I go to school, too.  My favorite part was her crazy collage.   I made one, too.  We hung it in my room.  The book's illustration are only black and white. However, I do not find this disappointing. I like the character Frank; his room is filled with weird collections.  I would would definitely recommend this book and other Judy Moody books as well. 
 This translation was first published in Great Britain by Dobson in 1955, as "The Authentic New Testament: Edited and Translated from the Greek for the General Reader," with a paperback from Panther. It was reissued in the United States as A Mentor Book from New American Library in 1958; a mass-market paperback, 478 pages in very small print. (The publisher -- much more recently absorbed into the Penguin Group -- is also identified, as on Amazon, as Signet; the most common NAL imprint, with titles often switching from one to the other between printings. Mentor was often used for more "serious" literature, although I still own a lot of "Mentor Classics" which also had Signet Classic printings. But I have in front of me MD215, "A Mentor Book.")  I am giving this American edition of the 1955 translation five stars, with some reservations, due in part to its age, and lack of availability; there is a later edition, as "The Original New Testament," revised by the translator, which for most purposes is better, and, being in larger type, certainly easier to read (see further, below.)  The "Authentic" translation preceded by a decade Hugh J. Schonfield's controversial bestseller "The Passover Plot: New Light on the History of Jesus" (1965; just reissued in A Special Fortieth Anniversary Edition) and its sequel "Those Incredible Christians" (1968), which I tend to see as the outlines and documentation for a set of brilliant, but unfortunately unwritten, novels about Jesus and the early Church. The translation followed and accompanied a number of earlier, much less sensational, books on the origins of Christianity.   (For Schonfield's life, and his interesting but often odd views on both Judaism and Christianity, see "Passing Over the Plot? The Life and Work of Hugh Schonfield (1901-1988)" by Richard Harvey, available online in a pdf of "Mishkan" 37 for 2002; the orientation is very much "mission-to-the-Jews," but the information seems sound.)   The revised edition was published in 1985 with the new title of "The Original New Testament: A Radical Translation and Reinterpretation" (Waterstones in the U.K. and Harper & Row in the U.S.). It was reissued in an Element Books paperback edition in 1998 with the less happy apparent subtitle (on the cover) of "The First Definitive Translation of the New Testament in 2000 Years," which isn't what Schonfield claimed it to be. (I suspect a publicity statement or blurb got "promoted.")  At this writing, all editions are out of print, although the Harper printing seems to be fairly readily available on Amazon through dealers. (Careful reading of offerings may show that some of these are in fact the trade paperback.) The 1985 edition was updated, and in much more legible print than the old mass-market paperback, the only version previously readily available in the U.S. But some useful features (see below) were dropped; so the old edition is not without some practical value, as well as interest; and it remains useful for those studying Schonfield's views in his books of the 1960s, in which he referred to the "Authentic" text. (Even with omissions, the later version still runs to 594 pages, not counting the 34-page Introduction.)   Schonfield's is a strikingly interesting approach, highly personal, but well-informed, like Richmond Lattimore's contemporary translations (1962-1982; collected as "The New Testament," 1996); although Lattimore, a classical scholar, avoided both theology and history in favor of reflecting Greek style. Schonfield is certain to infuriate some people, and to annoy almost every reader at one point or another; but the translation and commentary are never dull, and despite glossing over some issues as too boring for the General Reader, mostly reliable as to facts, if not conclusions. (One sometimes has to read carefully to tell the difference.)   The translation was not originally undertaken to support Schonfield's decidedly quirky "take" on Jesus (whose career he later interpreted as that of an apocalyptic messianist, who stage-managed a "Scripture-fulfilling" confrontation with Rome), but to present the lay reader with two then (circa 1950) less familiar ways of approaching the New Testament; as Greek texts whose contents and order are less securely established than official translations would suggest, and as the products of Jewish communities, not yet clearly differentiated into "The Early Church."  As for the first, it still seems to be new and shocking to some to think of the New Testament as a set of writings with a complex manuscript history. This fact was not very obviously reflected in the standard, ecclesiastically-sponsored translations, which often smoothed over most such difficulties, particularly in popular printings with minimal textual notes. (In recent decades, fuller editions make this clear; the Catholic "New Jerusalem Bible," for example, is available in study versions, with elaborate references to variants, and simplified presentations for the "ordinary reader.") To the surprise of some (both church-goers and non-believers), there is a substantial body of scholarship which has attempted to figure out how the text reached its present state, an effort not to be confused with historical speculations about "what really happened."   As part of offering a non-standard presentation, emphasizing unexpected and "difficult" variants, Schonfield often disregards traditional divisions, introduces new ones, separates out some passages as secondary elaborations, and shifts others from their accustomed places. He substitutes a reconstructed chronological order for the somewhat arbitrary arrangement in most printed texts. (The manuscript evidence on this is somewhat chaotic, and the usual order is a convention that lacks the authority assumed by many readers.)   The original "Authentic New Testament" edition contains a finding table for converting King James Version references to page numbers; a helpful feature dropped in the revised edition. The introduction of a somewhat better, but still not completely satisfactory, indication of the standard chapter and verse numbers is not a full substitute. The omission of the original "Index of Persons and Places," and the replacement of the "Index of References" with a "Bibliography of Antique Sources Employed," are also regrettable. These were quite helpful; in fact I still refer to them in my old copy from time to time.  Schonfield often looks like he is merely imposing his own preferences on someone else's sacred texts, but he claims that many of his variations can be traced quite readily in the apparatus to a critical Greek New Testament. I've used his versions for years alongside a 1960 pocket-size printing of Nestle and Aland's "Novum Testamentum Graece" (1924), some version of which was probably among the (unspecified) editions he used, and found that he does, indeed, often reflect specific manuscript evidence, and offers resolutions to real problems. (I've also compared the revision to the 1966 "The Greek New Testament" of Aland, Black, Metzger, and Wikgren, and occasionally to other critical texts.)   In other cases, such as his treatment of the Pauline Epistles, he drew on existing theories about their structure and compilation. I am less happy about this, for, although some of the suggestions look plausible, I can't imagine how we can know for sure that, for example, a given canonical epistle is stitched together from several discrete letters, and was not dictated in several sittings instead.   There is interesting evidence for such practices of repackaging in the letters among the so-called Apostolic Fathers, another set of very early Christian writings, which Schonfield cites; too bad he didn't add a translation of some of those works, as well, illustrating the approach with less sensitive materials. (There is a recent bilingual edition of these texts, which have come in for renewed attention, in the Loeb Classical Library. They should not be confused with Christian apocrypha, such as non-canonical Gospels and Acts, which Schonfield also draws on for evidence.)   Some of Schonfield's re-arrangements, such as shifting Revelation 1:8 to follow 1:3, make excellent literary sense (in this case rounding off one passage more neatly and allowing the next to conclude with "Amen"), but don't seem to have any other justification. But trying to "restore" the logic of apocalyptic writings, which tend to describe themselves as dreams, is not a failing confined to Schonfield.   His clustering of at least nominally related materials (Luke with Acts, the Johannine Epistles with the Gospel and Revelation) is actually helpful. His separation of Hebrews (as "Homily on the High Priesthood of Christ") from the letters of Paul will not surprise anyone aware of the literary and linguistic problems the attribution presents, but may offend those unaware that the conventional "The Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews" in many editions follows not the sacred text, but a tradition already questioned in the early Church.   The second feature is offering the New Testament as a set of documents written by Jews, for other Jews, but read, and usually misunderstood, by non-Jews who have brought to it centuries of misconceptions. From my point of view, the great weakness of this approach, when applied to the accepted Christian canon, is that it takes for granted the relatively early dates and generally non-gentile context of (almost) the whole corpus -- which I think is what needs to be demonstrated for some portions. It is one of points on which Schonfield is closest to traditional Christian views!   Schonfield attempts to clear away what he regards as confusion about what Jesus and Paul (in particular) were talking about by resorting to Jewish texts, mostly the Hellenistic and traditional Rabbinic sources mined by scholars since the nineteenth century, with additional light from the Pseudepigrapha, originally Jewish (probably) works involving "Old Testament" characters which have survived, for the most part, only in Christian translations. He also drew on the emerging documentation offered by the Dead Sea Scrolls, so far as they had been published.   (These texts have turned out to include fragments of Hebrew and Aramaic versions of some of the Pseudepigrapha, supporting some but not all of Schonfield's suggestions, but these were mostly published too late for Schonfield to make much use of them. In the 1955 text, they are still, I think, something of an undigested novelty; although he may have understood them better than most New Testament scholars of his generation.)   He was conversant with halacha (Jewish law and practice) and midrash (homiletic exposition of scripture) and non-Biblical aggadah (story-telling), and drew on them constantly; not unprecedented, except that most Christian writers through the first half of the twentieth century had been very much concerned to "prove" either the superiority of Christianity or the blindness of "the Jews," and often rather worried about undermining Christian theological readings of the allusions they were explicating.  (Back in 1986, at least one reviewer of the Harper edition suggested that Schonfield was taking sides in an inner-Christian dispute over the proper form of Baptism. I don't see it that way. Schonfield, simply unconcerned over whether baptism should be *carried out* by sprinkling or by immersion (which is what might be called Christian halacha), cheerfully pointed out that John the Baptist must, contextually, be John the Immerser. Ritual immersion in "living water" for purification was, and is, a Jewish practice. The only remotely relevant sprinkling ritual, with water in which the ashes of a red heifer have been dissolved, was for exposure to a dead body, and was associated with the Jerusalem Temple, not wandering preachers, and a special category of contagious impurity, not repentance for sins. The public reaction to John suggests that he was adapting something familiar, not offering a strange innovation. No suggestions were offered by Schonfield on how, or even whether, this information should inform practice. I can see the reviewer's problem; the application is a living issue for some Christians. But offering a simple explanation from Jewish practice and theory at points where Christians have spent almost two millennia fighting over complex ones drawn from doctrine does have its attractions.)  On the Jewish side, Schonfield's treatment has some problems, of a different nature. On the one hand, he (very properly) discussed the astonishing variety of Judaisms co-existing in Roman times, and tried to reconstruct the messages of Jesus and Paul to fit among them. On the other, he tended to cite the modern "traditional" Jewish prayer-book as if it clearly reflected First Century liturgical practices. The antiquity of both the whole service and specific formulations in it are open to debate; some is clearly ancient, large portions are definitely medieval, some sections later still. One would have to read very closely indeed to gather that from Schonfield. (Shelby Spong, an Episcopal Bishop, fell into a similar trap in 1996 in his "Liberating the Gospels: Reading the Bible with Jewish Eyes." He there tries to explain the structure of the Gospel narratives as originally linked to a Synagogue reading cycle of Scripture, which, alas, is not securely dated itself.)   Given the actual post-Christian date of most of the texts Schonfield was working with, this is only an extreme example of the problem. As mentioned earlier, he acknowledged this in general in his introduction, but declined to offer detailed explanations of his conclusions in particular cases, which, he explained would be too long and tedious. He was probably right about that, but, unfortunately, he doesn't seem to have gone into the matter in detail in his other books on early Christianity (mostly out of print), either.   Most readers with an interest in Schonfield's view will probably find the "Original New Testament" editions more convenient, and easier on the eyes. However, in the absence of the original (British) 1955 hardcover, the 1958 printing is, as already noted, useful for verifying quotations; and was the version Schonfield himself had in mind in his best-seller a decade later. I sometimes still use it for these reasons. So it may well be what a given reader is looking for.  I should point out, therefore, that, given the thin paper used to keep the Mentor edition mass-market size, and the long life of my copy (even *before* I acquired it around 1970), it is not surprising that the one I am using is a bit fragile, and seems to generate its own acrid cloud when opened; a nose-wrinkling, and, combined with the small print, an eye-watering experience. Which, taken together with the title, often reminds me of Danny Kaye singing: "We did research! Authenticity was a must! / Zooks! Did we search! What did we find? Achoo! A lot of dust ..."*  *From "Life Could Not Better Be," lyrics by Sammy Cahn, music by Sylvia Fine Kaye, in "The Court Jester" (1956); also the theme song to the "The Danny Kaye Show," 1963-1967 
 I really like this product.  Even after a full day, I am still comfortable. Wearing such a large size is hard to come by sometimes. Especially when I enjoy the front closure. There are very few to choose from. I was lucky to find this.  It really is comfortable & supporting at the the same time. This is really hard sometimes, trying to find both. I feel I found that in this product.  I hope they don't discontinue the item. Thanks again Vanity Fair 
 Joseph Conrad has long been one of my favorite authors.  His works can be difficult to understand, with all the shades of meanings and the complicated plots, but Conrad's novels have always been worth the effort.  Victory was one of the more readable works; and one of the most spell-binding.  A great story by a great author:  I'm very glad I read this 
 My old carafe had broken, and I was looking for a replacement.  This was the only one available and in stock.  Although I thought it was a little expensive, I love my Krups coffee maker and really needed a new carafe, so I went ahead and ordered it.  It certainly was worth the price.  The coffee stays hot for hours!!  This carafe is better than the one that came with the coffee maker and was worth every penny I paid for it 
 I bought the book when I took the course from Yogesh Jaluria (the authur).  I found it to be an excellently written book with clear explanation of the numerical methods before each example.  This book is a reflection of his teaching which is also superb.  It might not be as comprehensive as Numerical Recipe but I found it to be much more tangible and clearer.  I highly recommend it to to all engineering AND science students.  There are only two grips I have with the book, all the codes are written in FORTRAN 77, which is a bit dated depending on your point of view, the other is that the pages like to fall off over time in the softcover copy 
 I love these gloves. I use them for cardio and weightlifting. I work out 4 times a week and wear these gloves every time I work out. very comfortable. great grip for lifting the big weights. don't ever smell. I haven't listened to the CD yet. 
 Nice collection of historic stories about the history of LSD.  This has a slightly different account, of the history we have all heard before; as reguards the 60's counter-culture movement 
 I originally bought a different dictionary, by Harper's, but bought this later.  I like it better because this shows pronunciation as well as stress points for the Italian words.  It also has more words, and goes more deeply into idiomatic uses for many of the common words.  Good for beginners 
 General Harold K. Johnson was a figure of such renown and personal integrity that his life literally cried out for a biographer. Now he has one -- and Lewis Sorley has proven up to the task. This is a major work of biography on one of America's finest soldiers. Obviously the result of years of research, Sorley's vivid recounting of Johnson's agonizing years of imprisonment under the Japanese, his heroism in the bloody combat of Korea, and his climb to the top of the Army's command ladder sets the standard for biographical excellence. I have not read a better biography of any military figure since Bruce Catton's treatment of Grant. This is an exceptionally fine book that leaves only one unanswered question: when does Sorley's next work come out 
        Lightning strikes again as the wild AI number 20 (Toni) comes to life! Now Hitoshi has two AI's to deal with. But the crazy Toni tries to break Saati & hitoshi up to show shes the best! This book is full of comedy and fun, especially since the wild Toni has arrived!            Opinion: I believe this book is funny and well drawn and a nice addition to Ken Akamatsu's collection of magma 
 I ordered several books on estates and what to do after someone passes away; after reviewing all of them, this is THE book I really used. It was the most complete, helpful, and accessible book on the topic. Also, note that it does NOT just deal with Probate -- my situation did not involve probate (fortuntaely!), but I still found this book invaluable in helping me know what to do about all the various matters after my mother passed away. I highly recommend this book 
  James McPherson is one of the top civil war historians and this is his greatest book.  It covers not only the whole of the war with objective analysis that takes into consideration sources on both sides but also the start of the war. From the annexation of Texas and the war with Mexico where our commanders got their experience McPherson demonstrates his expert knowledge.  The book recounts not only the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac, but also looks at the western front. The battles in the west were easily as important as the east and this provides a great summary.  It also takes into account the slave question, economic concerns and foreign diplomacy. The two chapters on the navy and river battles are expertly done and capture the advancements made in naval technology during the times.  The end of the war is well categorized and the book does not get bogged down in countless battle details.  The final days of the confederacy are seen for what they are. It was a nation that was defeated and unable to keep its army in the field.  The book is very well written and easy to read making it a sheer joy to understand the civil war.  This is an essential book for any student of history or anyone who wants to learn about the Civil War.

An audio cd accompanying written word captures some of the nuances of this world, focusing on the power of poetry performed out loud around the world. From new styles such as slam and Taos to poems by Regie Gibson, Viggo Mortensen and Saul Williams, be ready to learn about radical new styles of spoken word which blend poetry with social insights. 
 I gave this book 4 stars simply because once I started it I couldn't put it down.  Of course I love Marilyn Monroe.  Who wouldn't after seeing one of her films?  But this is the first book I've read about her.  Leaming has a fast-paced, journalistic style.  She gives a lot of facts, but also a lot of speculation. I took one star away because one could actually rename the book:  Marilyn Monroe as described by the men around her.  And she knew a lot of selfish users! On the one hand they tell us she's a vicious ballbreaker.  On the other, we hear that she's nothing but a weak, mentally ill junkie.  Which is it?  She couldn't be both at the same time.  My impression is that she had to fight misogyny with both fists from the day she was born until the day she died.  And she was brilliant, regardless of the alcohol/pill habit...Based on Leaming's account, I would call Dr. Ralph Greenson an extremely questionable figure.  He appears to spend all his time hovering around just one client, Marilyn.  He knows the first thing she needs is to get off alcohol and pills, yet instead he guarantees that she's always amply supplied with both.  He personally chooses Marilyn's lawyer, Mickey Rudin, and her housekeeper, Eunice Murray.  Greenson has no concern whatsoever about doctor-patient privilege (confidentiality), and even has a private lunch with Marilyn's boss in Fox's executive conference room weeks before her death.  What sort of a shrink is this?...Leaming concludes that Marilyn killed herself, but my opinion, based on the same material, is that it was someone else who decided to silence her permanently. 
 The Solar Queen is an omnibus edition in the Solar Queen series. It contains the first two novels: Sargasso of Space and Plague Ship.  Dane Thorson is an apprentice cargomaster on the independent trader Solar Queen. His fellow crewmembers include Captain Jellico, Cargomaster Van Rycke, Astrogator Steen Wilcox, Chief Engineer Johan Stotz, Medic Craig Tau, Comtech Tang Ya, Cook-Steward Frank Mura, Jetmen Karl Kosti and Jasper Weeks, and Apprentices Rip Shannon and Ali Kamal. The ancillary crew of the Solar Queen consist of Sinbad, the ship's cat, and Queex the Hoobat.  In Sargasso of Space (1955), the Solar Queen wins trade rights to the D-class planet Limbo, which happens to contain some powerful forerunner technology and a nest of pirates.  In Plague Ship (1956), the Solar Queen has negotiated a change of trade rights, swapping their claims on Limbo for access to the new spices and gems on Sargol, the homeworld of the feline Saliriki. All goes well on the planet, but the crew members start to fall into a deep sleep one by one as they travel back to Terra.  These stories were originally published under the pseudonym of Andrew North. They were the beginning of a series of adventures that have introduced many people to the SF genre in the five decades since their publication. These tales demonstrate the author's skills as a story teller and show why the author has attracted so many dedicated fans over the decades.  Highly recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of a future filled with strange adventures and exotic cultures.  -Arthur W. Jordin 
 Excellent! One of the best of its kind, clarifying the relationship of God, man, and the world. Required reading for anyone interested in religion and especially basic Christian beliefs 
 I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Every woman, especially women of color, should read this book.  I wholeheartedly recommend it without reservation or hesitation whatsoever.  The moment you pick it up, you probably will not want to put it down.  What I enjoyed the most was its practicality no matter what your financial situation is.  The section on writing down your goals is significant.  If you carefully, and prayerfully, read this book, you will have all the confidence you need to straighten out your financial situation.  It will definitely make an immediate difference on your philosophy of investing and preparing for retirement.  I beg you on hands and knees to buy it without delay!  You will be soooooooooooooooooooooo glad you did 
 This particular poem is my favorite Robert Frost poem, and is one of my top five favorite poems. I was hoping that this book would portray the simple beauty and nuances of this poem, to read to my granddaughter. It more than met my expectations. Even my husband, who is a photographer and who doesn't read as much as I do, found the artwork in this book to convey beautifully the words of Frost's poem.   This poem was not intended for children, and has many facets to it. But good poetry must be taught and appreciated early, and this book will help parents and teachers to show appreciation for poetry. If it doesn't start with the parents and teachers, then the children are never exposed to it.   Whenever I read this poem, and now this book, it conveys a sense of peace, a sense of being quiet, of learning to look for the beauty in the world around you. This should be a classic.  Karen Sadle 
 Been looking for an entry point to graphic design for a long time, but this book is the first time I've actually "got it". Very succinct, no hand-waving, with excellent explanations and examples. I was working on a document design while reading this book, and with each chapter I was able to further revise the design and see it evolve. I'm very indebted to the author for opening up a whole new part of my right-brain 
  This is not just dumb humor.  It is hard to describe without it sounding dumb, though!  The writeups are as funny as the pictures.  This does contain some profanity so you might not want to get it for a younger kid.    
 If you enjoyed the movie you'll enjoy this soundtrack. Each track vividly reminds you of the movie scene in which it was played. And even if you didn't like the movie, there are some fun tunes on here. There are several classics such as 'Love Is In the Air' by John Paul Young, 'Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps' by Doris Day, 'Os Quindins De Ya Ya' by Stanley Black as well as a sweet cover of 'Time After Time'.  It's all good for listening to, relaxing to, but most of, for dancing to 
 R. Gregory Alonso must have been a woman in a previous life, because he nails a lot of things right on the head. He understands the way a woman feels, and thinks.  After reading this book (a suggestion from a friend), I have to say that I am impressed with his writing.  Men really need to read this and apply some of the tactics if they want a happier love life.  It will help to open anyone's eyes that read this. Thanks for writing such a great book, after reading your "Say Yes to Success" book I did not know what to expect with this one. Thank you again 
 People are very aware of the need to physically relax, take a vacation, treat yourself to a message - anything to breakup the physical demands of the day.  This book is the for the mind - rejuvenation and perspective.  A refresher course on how quickly we have transformed from stability in our lives to information overload and around-the-clock access. If you would like to STOP for a moment and apply thoughtful analysis to your workday and find perspective on what's happening to transform our lives - read this book.  I have found so many ways to apply what I've read to my business and personal life 
 I liked the approach.  It's not a recipe for starting an LLC (there are plenty of those out there).  It is more like background reading about the philosophy driving how LLCs are taxed, and what that means for how the LLC income is distributed and reported.  Lots on maintaining capital accounts.  There was a fair amount I ignored -- California and real estate specific information --  but the rest was very helpful.  Chapter 5 on tax forms and Chapter 7 on partnership rules were especially useful.  
 If you want to reduce your livestock health costs by doing your own fecal exams for parasites, this book is full of information and photos that you cannot do without!  Thanks to the spiral binding, it lies flat beside my microscope for easy reference and accurate identifications.  I use mine monthly 
 A fascinating and plausible theory that artists used optical aids much earlier than previously believed. Well written and beautifully illustrated 
 Let's face it, raising a teenage daughter sometimes feels tantamount to raising the Titanic. At times it seems impossible, and there are no easy answers to the questions, doubts, and insecurities that plague our vulnerable girls. Hersh's book, walks the tightrope of offering both the hard hitting truths about the dangers awaiting our daughters, and the power AND practicality of enduring love. Read the book, and start walking hand-in-hand with your daughter in ways you never dreamed possible 
 In "The Christ of the Prophets", Robertson provides a stimulating study of the role of Israel's prophets, and the content of their writings.  The book is thoughtfully structured, looking at:  * prophetism in general: how did prophetic ministry arise (e.g. comparing similarities and differences between God's prophets and the pagan history of surrounding nations), how did it fit into God's overall revelation through the Law and history, what characterizes how were prophets commissioned and how their veracity was confirmed;  * analysis of each prophet's context and writings, identifying major concerns that the prophet addresses and major unifying themes in the book.  This is the antithesis of "pick-a-verse-and-spin-it-to-support-my-preconception theology" like characterizes much popular religious literature; Robertson looks at the prophet's messages overall and shows how individual texts that demonstrate it.  For example, he demonstrates how Jeremiah's is structured around themes of "one key exhortation, two key visions, and six key words".  Quoting from p. 270,     "The six key words grouped together in Jeremiah's call appear as six consecutive infinitives, four with negative and two with positive connotations: 'to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and plant' (1:10 NIV).  While the significance of these terms in the message of Jeremiah is often recognized, their regular appearance at critical moments throughout the book is not generally noted.  Their prominent role at seven key points makes them deserving of more extensive consideration."  ... which consideration Robertson weaves into the following 12 pages.  * a review of the implications of prophecy: while prophecy is much more than prediction, what is prediction all about; and the development of central themes that unify all of the canon prophetic literature.  Robertson writes with an orthodox Christian perspective, engaging other viewpoints.  He recognizes that some people who reject divine intervention a priori will explain away that prophetic writing contain any supernatural content.  However, he challenges believers to be consistent in their faith: if God is active in the world, it doesn't make sense to reject prediction in prophecy just because unbelievers do so a priori.  For example, in his assessment of the book of Isaiah, he addresses critics' arguments for this being a compilation of three separate writings produced over a couple centuries, but provides a compelling counterargument that the unifying themes in the book outweigh arguments for its being a compilation, when assessed from an objective viewpoint.  Robertson demonstrates continuity and discontinuity between the old testament prophets and fulfullment in the New Testament: how the themes of the prophets of the old testament are both continued, and fulfilled, in Jesus the Messiah.  For example, the inclusion of the gentiles is stressed as a significant aspect of prophecy, and that Israel can never regard itself as being properly and scripturally 'restored' apart from the full inclusion of Gentile peoples.  I cite one passage from his concluding chapters up that demonstrate the basic style and premises of the book:  p. 416 "A third element in predictive prophecy underscores the fact that the Lord's prophets predict divine redemptive activities.  Contrary to all pseudoprophetism, ancient and modern, biblical predictions never appear as isolated prognostications about secularized political or personal eventualities.  The predictions of the prophets always relate to God's ongoing purposes to redeem a people to himself, beginning with Israel and reaching ultimately to all the nations of the world.  The curse on creation will be removed, sin will be forgiven and rooted out, universal justice will be established, and peace will be restored between God and men, between men and men, and between men and creation.  God's ongoing purpose for the 'restoration of all things' (Acts 3:21) provides the purposeful framework in which all biblical predictions operate."  This book is a pleasurable read, but is not a light one.  It requires attention and thoughfulness, but rewards them with rich content and the elequence of how it is presented.  Having completed a first read, I plan to add this to my "favourite readings" shelf for ongoing reference 
 This is a beautifully written remembrance of one of the world's greatest songwriters.  Berlin fans will welcome the personal insight, warmth and vivid detail that author Barrett provides.  A recluse for the last 25 years of his life, Berlin has been an enigma to many, and this book provides many of the intimate details so sorely lacking in other biographies of this American treasur 
 Okay first of all, don't let the title mislead you. One of the two main characters is a samurai but don't expect sword fights and bloody battles in this book. With that said I very much enjoyed this book and thought the author does an amazing job with making all the scenes come alive simply by his descriptions of the settings. I would certainly recommend this book to a friend and even though this is an religious novel, I don't believe you have to be a religious person to get something out of this book 
 This Book Is great for children that love trains. When i was 5 and under i was CUKOO about trains. When i recieved this book i went nuts and i loved it! Parents Buy it!  its great for a gift. Heres my favorite line. (  Spikes and Crossties- smooth worn rails- through the twilight- whistle  wails- feel the rythm- hear the sound- clickety-clacking- homeward bound. )  Thats just one of the pages and theres many more even better so get this  book. They'll love it 
 "The Most Beautiful Libraries in the World" is kept on the fireplace mantlepiece in our library for people to come and view. I liked the book so much I bought my father it for Valentine's Day. He has visited many libraries and gone on library tours in Europe, so the pictures brought back many memories for him and reminded him of how our ancestors treasured libraries and kept the books in good condition.  Anybody who is a library connoisseur will enjoy this book.  As written in the introduction, "One must spend hours upon hours, and days upon  days in the cocoon of a great library in order  to understand and love the cozy isolation that it  can provide.  Some people will never break away from its spell and remain eternal readers, having lost the desire to discover the real world.  Others will know how to find lin libraries both knowledge and its instruments."  Enjoy Cynthia Naka 
 This was a terrific book on what it's like to start out as a doctor.  He describes events from his internship from the perspective of a newcomer, and I felt what it was like to become a doctor without having to go through all that medical school stuff.  The most interesting part to me was when he described the feelings medical students go through in separating in their mind the physical body and the psychological being inside.  I've always thought that since I faint at the sight of blood I would never be able to be a doctor, but that's what most new medical students do!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I enjoyed even more his other book on becoming a psychiatrist, because it included more personal stories about the philosophical questions he encountered during this transition in his life.  The author also writes very interesting articles for the New York Times, some of which you can find if you search the web. 
 This is a decent guidebook but I must confess that I like Lonely Planet and I'm very familiar with their format.  If you use this along with another guidebook and a really good map then you will be fine.  Be warned that Shanghai is a very dynamic city and it is constantly changing.  This edition is already out of date so Lonely Planet needs to release a new version ASAP.  Overall, it gives you good background about Shanghai and I wouldn't go there without it 
 This CD player is very good. The bluetooth features works quite well with my cel phone (this was the main reason I bought this model). Another plus is the Ipod adapter. I recommend to buy this option if you have an Ipod. It's very useful. The only contra I found it this CD player: it's not so user friendly to use. To take profit of all features available, sometimes you need to read the user guide. 
 I've read a lot of books on relationships and communication.  And I've read other books by Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott (I've also heard them in a live seminar).  But I've got to admit that Love Talk blew me away.  My wife and I read it together and did the men's and women's workbooks that go with it.  Amazing!  Almost immediately we began to notice a difference in our conversations.  And best of all, as the book points out, this doesn't require that either one of us change.  The book shows you, in easy to understand language, how each person is "hard-wired" differently for a conversation.  Once you crack the code of your partner's hard-wiring (and your partner does the same for you), you begin to spin out of potential conflict very quickly.  You begin to feel safe in your conversations.  I've been looking for a book like this for a long time.  And if you want a fresh and practical way to take your conversations to a deeper level, you'll be very glad you read Love Talk.  By the way, it comes with a killer online assessment, The Love Talk Indicator.  The only down side is that if you want your partner to also take the assessment, it will cost you another $14.95 at the Parrott's website.  But in my opinion, it's well worth it.    
 Great companion book to "Understanding Digital Signal Processors" by Lyons and "Digital Signal Processors" by Hayes. I would recommend this book strictly for a companion book. It doesn't go into in-depth detail or explanation of Laplace, z-transforms, or Fourier Transforms but displays a good foundation for MatLab DSP routines 
 I love this camera case! It is manufactured from very fine materials. It is very soft to the touch while being protective of my camera. The craftsmanship is outstanding. It is well worth the purchase price and then some 
 the more I love the writings of John Grisham.  This is definately one of his shorter ones but it's not "short" on a good story.  Sometimes a good, quick read is just the thing you need to make you feel better.  I love having an author that I can just pick up and read and know it's going to be good.  
 The book is full of useful models, and interesting, real-life ancedotes.  The book is divided into the different types of teams, so you can turn right to the chapter that fits your needs - pointing out that one size team approach does not fit all.  I appreciated the chapter on global teams (ch 8).  
 This ranks, after Master of Puppets, as Metallicas greatest album. Crushing, brutal, cold, intelligent, and dowright epic. The production is also amazing, making the record sound as if it was recorded in a steel cube, and brings the concepts of the album, injustice, conformity, despair, and death, even more into focus. In 89 when this one was released I remember it being slightly overlooked and put fourth in the Metallica canon of greatness behind their three previous records, but no way. This one comes right after "Master" and is a much stronger album than Ride the Lightning and Kill Em All. I mean 18 years after its initial release and it still sounds incredibly fresh. A must have for any metal or hard rcok fan or just a fan of good and thought provoking music. 
 This is my favorite book by Mr. Crichton...I have read every book by him that I can find...I just found the plot to be very suspenseful and mind-bending. Granted I am 15 so maybe my knowledge of literature is not as high as some adults but this is a great read! -Blak 
 This book was exactly what I needed. It contains all the information I needed. A great learning tool. The part of the book I am most impressed with is the section of infant nutrition. It explains month by month what you can feed your infant. An example is the 4th month of life, you can start your child on iron enriched cereals 
 This fine book is an effort to produce a scholarly work that is accessible to the broad reading public.  Prof. Low is quite successful in her effort to satisfy both audiences.  Her primary preoccupations are to examine the consequences of fundamental differences between men and women in reproductive strategies, and through the examination of these consequences to demonstrate the utility of applying relatively simple Darwinian concepts to the study of human social behavior.  She draws on a wide variety of literature, including ethnology, history, studies of other mammalian species, particularly other primates, and political science research.  The first 2 or 3 chapters are relatively rudimentary but give a very careful overview of the intellectual apparatus used, and the limitations of that apparatus, for studies of this kind.  The chapters on human behaviors specifically are excellent; thorough, well documented, and intellectually honest.  This is a convincing book which may upset some but contains very well thought out and very well defended analyses of many aspects of human behavior.  There is an excellent bibliography and fine footnotes 
 Very high quality recording and faithful to the writen books content, great way to hear very important knowledge 
 Betty did a great job with this book. I read one of her first additions and she helped me find my focus which ultimately led me to my career. Anyone who is unsure of where they want to go with their career should pick up Betty's book 
 i know people have free speech and i don't condem them people for saying that this is inxs worst album but you must be joking this is not their worst album this is a fantastic heavier sounding inxs in my opipion inxs grew up when they recorded this album it still has the dance beats but it's got heavier riffs and fantastic lyrics and songs that you remember weeks after i cannot fault this album it's my favorite  in second place kick and third listen like thieves  a great last album from the real inxs not the phoney tribute band they are now...god bless hutchence 
 The one star review below was likely made by someone who read an early edition of the book - the past two editions have been an ambitious re-write by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.  The result is a book whose clarity is unmatched by any other text I've come across that addresses the history of Buddhism.  
 As someone who has begun my education to become a financial planner but has not yet transitioned careers, this book has been essential in painting a picture of the financial planning landscape.  Reading about the most successful firms using such a wide variety of models helps to place your ideas on the map and give a vision for the future.  Rowland's tie in to the ongoing debate about the future of the industry gives depth to a book that primarily gives snapshots of different businesses.  Winners from across the spectrum weigh in, and not always with the same answer.  For sure, you will come away from this book with an appreciation for the substantive changes that have taken place with every five year period over the last generation and an understanding that change will continue.  The chapter on niche businesses was excellent.  She profiles six of them to give you an appreciation for the different dimensions by which a niche can be defined.  At the other end, she highlights only one sole practioner which was disappointing since that is perhaps the most numerous type of planner.  Most chapters profile 2-3 businesses which is enough.  To stay objectively supportive of all the models, Rowland publishes very few figures on the absolute or marginal profitability of the firms.  This is probably best as it keeps vision and corporate identity at the forefront.  In a profession where the winners are invariably pursuing a passion as much as a paycheck, this tactic was a wise choice 
 Anderson's classic tale of the Emperor has taken a new twist with an elegance never before found in art work. The setting has changed to the early 1900's with cars, planes, pet dogs as part of royalty. I think it will appeal to a mature audiance. One could browse the pages as if they were a museum.   The dogs are a marvelous touch. Looking under a stand-up mirror is an adorable belly-up dog watching the emperor as he puts on his magnificant clothes. All one sees of the emperor at this point are two bare feet. Two pups are gleefully making off with the emperor's cocks 
 This is the soundtrack to the documentary (or "rockumentary", if you will) "This is Spinal Tap".  The film chronicles hard rock band Spinal Tap, as they tour the US in support of their album "Smell the Glove" (circa 1982).  But the soundtrack doesn't include any of the live performances featured in the film.  Instead, the original studio versions of the songs the band plays in the film are featured.  So in a way, the album functions as sort of a "greatest hits" album (not that they had very many hits).  The earliest songs here stretch all the way back to 1965, back when the band was a Merseybeat group called the Thamesmen.  Then we move forward a few years, when the band changed it's moniker to Spinal Tap and recorded the hippie anthem "(Listen to the) Flower People".  The rest of the material on the album is of more recent vintage, after the band had evolved (devolved?) into it's final incarnation as a hard rock band.  While this version of the band didn't have much commercial or critical success, they were quite influential on many of the "hair" bands of the 1980s.  Until all of Spinal Tap's old albums are re-released (which seems unlikely), Tapheads will have to be satisfied with this CD.  Turn it up to 11 and give it a listen 
 I found the definitions to be vague, and even the definitions of terms change as you go through the chapter, which is confusing, when you're trying to retain all this new information.  The author should provide a list of examples of terms, so that we understand and grasp what the meanings of terms are, and how they are linked to other definitions.    For example, a cash flow from investing actitivites are defined as "cash flows related to the acquisition or sale of the company's productive assests". As you do some homework prolems and online quizzes, you can gather that productive assests are more than manufacturing equipment, which was the one example given in the book.  If I don't know what productive assets are, then I'm not going to understand what cash flow from investing activities are.    Also, why not provide an answer key so that you can check to see if you're doing the work correctly and that you have the right understanding?  The answer key should not be just for teachers 
 This is a great collection of essays and other writers by one of the foremost socialist critics of totalitarianism and domination. It is also a great book for admires of writers such as Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Edward said, as all share the same overarching purpose: to be a tireless critic of power and domination wherever it may be found. It is ironic to the extreme that so many conservative revisionists attempt to claim Orwell as their own, which is due to the tragically myopic misreading of his writings, especailly 1984 and Animal Farm. Both books are condemnations of totalitarianism, and in the case of Animal farm, the final page attests to Orwell's repugnance of capitalism. Let it not be forgotten that Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War in the aid of the socialist-anarchists. This is truly a great collection, which should be required reading for those who may not be familar with Orwell's non-fiction work 
 The food scenes in this movie are eye candy for us foodies. I love cooking and I have never seen food displayed or prepared in a movie as it is in this one.  The story line is charming in its concept of how food relates to our lives and our relationships. The fact that this is a subtitled movie did not bother me at all, because the scenes with the food were so tremendous that I couldn't stop staring. If you love food you will thoroughly enjoy this movie 
 One of the greatest of great Italian American novels addressing the immigrant participation in the bricks and mortar of building America and those who fell short of achieving the dream 
 This beautifully photographed, written and published book was more than I had expected.  It really shows this land at it's best.  Now, I cannot wait to see it for myself 
 The Vampire Tapestry is the story of dream researcher and vampire Dr. Edward Weyland. This is a very unique vampire story. Unlike the horror stories we are use to, here we have a complicated creature without fangs or any of the other things we expect; but he still needs blood.  The main character, the vampire, gets kidnapped and after escaping begins talking with a psychologist. He is not the stereotyped vampire at all and the author does not make him sad, pitiful, or sexual in any way. A very good read and something different. This type of vampire could actually exist.. 
 This item was durable, warm, the right size as advertised and the right price. 
 I really enjoyed this CD.  If you enjoy jazz style music, you're sure to like this disc.  I want to see the show now 
 It was a really good book.  It made me laugh, almost cry, and kept me on the edge of my seat till I was done.  I would LOVE to read the other 
 So like any number of other American disaffected from the political process and the culture of corruption these days in Washington, I picked up Barack Obama's autobiography in hopes of finding someone to believe in for the future.  I'm not going to say I was disappointed, but the book wasn't your typical "I'm going to run for President someday, listen to my ideas" story either.  In fact, much of it isn't political at all, rather it is a well written, sometimes interesting, sometimes fascinating story about Obama's life from Hawaii to Indonesia to Chicago to Kenya.    Pay more attention to the subtitle than the title, as Obama very carefully develops his credibility on issues of race, and I was left with the impression that he may be one of the few who can speak with authority and eloquence on immigration, family, and the issue of black-white race relations that has haunted our country for so long.  He just might be someone who can start the healing process if given the chance.  The other aspect of this book I enjoyed the most was how refreshingly honest it is.  No political editing, no glossed over sections. Obama very clearly states what he did and didn't do, what his regrets are, and what he has learned from his mistakes.    And couldn't we all use a little bit of honesty and eloquence from our leaders about now?    Some say Obama is a rising star.  I hope so.  I gave it four stars because it gets a little long winded in places, but it is still a very good read 
 This book offers numerous different ways to get your email IN and out boxes under control, as well as explaining how to keep the "nasty email" (spam, viruses, etc) OUT. I like the book's suggestions of setting up different folders for your email messages and then setting aside a certain time every so often to "clean it out." While I tend to be diligent about keeping my IN and OUT boxes to a minimum, not all of us are able to do that (or can afford to). And it's those readers this book is primarily addressed to. There are also chapters that detail how keep the amount of junk email you get down to a minimum, along with various methods to try. While explaining how various spam filters work (or don't work, depending on which one you use and how frequently it is used), there's also an informal "glossary of terms" about spam filters in one of the chapters.   The book also takes great pains to discuss viruses, worms, and other forms of "malware," which also includes adware and spyware. In other words, any program that affects your PC's performance in a less than positive way can be considered malware. The book also talks about "phishing," a practice where an official looking email arrives in your box, appearing to come from a financial institution or even the dreaded "Nigerian hoax" emails. It also discusses the "hoax emails," and how they too are like spam in that they "clog up" your email IN box.   I learned quite a few new ideas from reading this book and I'm sure anyone who reads this book will too 
 This is the second book by Jodi Picoult that I have read.  I became a fan after reading My Sister's Keeper.  Her writing style is what keeps the book interesting from beginning to end.    The characters are believeable and she doesn't bore you with details and facts that do not enrich the story.  Each chapter leaves you wanting more and will keep your interest to the very last page.    
 It's not often that you'll read historical non-fiction that grabs you and pulls you along, but this is one of those rare such books that would make great beach reading. There were a few times when I actually wished for a bit more technical detail, but Gordon does a wonderful job of telling his story without resorting to hyperbole 
 A Midwinter's Tale is a good read, however it doesn't have the same spell-binding , can't-put-it-down quality of Greeley's previous books. His main character, Chucky, is not as believeable as Blackie or Nuala, and  nowhere near as loveable. Chucky's disclaimers don't ring as true. Compared  to other authors' efforts, a wonderful book but compared to Greeley's  others A Midwinter's Tale falls short 
  An eye-opener. I Native American woman's true and raw disclosure of how it was to be living a Native American in South Dakota only decades ago. It was a good read but a lesson to be learned much the same. These events are only decades old, human being treated like animals on our soils, by people like us. Ignorance to such factors is inexcusable. A must read for a valuable lesson on diversity and humanity, and a thin line that separates us from what we call "evil" 
 While it wasn't exactly what I was looking for, this book gave a wonderful condensed history of the Ukraine.  This small country has gone through so many changes, and been under so many other countries leadership, finally winning their independance.  It makes you appreciate our own history 
 This is a work of art in itself. The pages show beautiful maps and    killer strategies that cannot be challenged. This amazing book shows all weapons, enemies, vehicles and even secret areas. It has unbeatable multiplayer strategies and shows all there is to Halo 2 on Xbox Live. Buy the superbly spectacular guide to the best game  ever right now!  
 I first read this book 2 years ago after purchasing it from Amazon, and loved it the moment I saw it. Sitting down to read it was almost like opening a chocolate box, with wonderful anecdotes from dozens of men and women who have served in the nexus of American Military decision making. I highly recomend this book to anyone who would like to find out more about the White House Situation room and it's impact on the world and the West Wing itself. 
 The book is a bit rough in places and lacks some of the crisp dialog I have come to expect, but all of that is overshadowed by the good points of the book.  Buy the book, enjoy it and support Sir Francis 
 Wonderful family movie. I have read the books and they are a joy so I was so pleased when the movie was as entertaining. In a world of distasteful and discouraging television, these movies are a definate thumbs up 
 Known for playing wicked bluegrass Dobro with Alison Krauss & Union Station, and adding vibey squareneck holler to hundreds of country albums, resonator king Jerry Douglas reveals exciting new sides of his musical persona on his latest solo record. Whether picking vocoder-drenched lap steel, trading hot licks with Derek Trucks, probing spacey blues with Bill Frisell, paying tribute to Weather Report with Joe Zawinul's "A Remark You Made," or tearing through hi-octane, new-acoustic riffage with Sam Bush and Béla Fleck, Douglas pushes his Tipton bar into fresh, adventurous realms. His fat, squishy electric tones contrast beautifully with his taut acoustic colors, and, as always, his intonation is perfect -- even at synapse-frying tempos. Krauss and John Fogerty each provide guest vocals (Krauss tackles L.T.D.'s funky 1977 hit "Back in Love Again," a real departure for her), but otherwise the album is an instrumental affair. The Best Kept Secret sets a new benchmark for lap slide virtuosity. 
 My son is only 4, but he really loves these stories!!  He feels like such a big boy reading longer stories with less pictures.  We have a great time reading and laughing at the things that happen to Stink 
 I used this for designing my website and it lifted the site at least 100%. The rules in the book are easy to apply and remember - there are just four of them. 
 The selections are chic and sophicated but easy to follow.  Its nice to be able to find something people will enjoy receiving or even to liven up a room in your  house.  She has wonderful instructions in every book on how to's for those who are beginning or even a brush up on those maybe you've forgotten.  You don't have to use her yarn (it is her book) but you can find mountains of subsitutes in any yarn store.  
 Having stumbled onto this film being played on TV late last night and given that Emmanuelle Bart was in this, I was immediately hooked into watching it. As has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cinma francais. Deneuve, Bart, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert......the list goes on. And being that the story revolves around these 8 women ( yes I know but there was really no other way of putting it ), it keeps you locked in.  What I found fascinating were the songs. Now normally I hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random ( think Rocky Horror Picture Show ) but this I can tolerate. The songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs. It's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes. Which is pure brilliance. Even if you don't like French pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which, when it breaks into a song, is exactly what it becomes!  The basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead. So whodunnit? This leads to questions over betrayal, family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family. Now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses. There seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them. Which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie. No ifs, no ands, no buts! Oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film, I will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry. It's that good!  Just simply superb. There's nothing else to add 
 Three warriors are stranded in a foreign land of a fantasy land or something and they must piece together the 5 parts of an ancient book so that they can return to Japan. The five parts of the book are written on the bodies of 5 elves that is funny 
 We have recently bought this DVD and highly recommend it.  Picture and sound quality are gorgeous. Aurélie Dupont's dancing is magnificent. She is elegant, weightless and she truly IS la Sylphide by expressing all her feelings and grace. Mathieu Gano is extremely elegant, athletic and very expressive. The "Corps de Ballet" is a model of precision and beauty. The forest décor with the flying Sylphides is magnificent. Lacotte's interview explains how he has succeeded in rebuilding the ballet as presented in 1832 from information painfully gathered over the years. A lovely moment for ballet lovers. 
 This gorgeous book has not only good recipes but is fun to sit down and read.  You learn a lot about baking at high altitudes and it's almost like visiting Deer Valley.  The sidelight comments are informative and friendly.   My favorites: Grougeres, Blueberry Galliano Cheesecake, Carrot cake and  Oatmeal Rosemary Scones and the twisted Sourdough bread (white and wheat  together) 
  In the introduction, the author states that ideology deceives and leads to fanaticism; it's like putting your brain on autopilot. Experience, facts and logic are the only reliable pathways to truth. The book investigates dishonest intellectuals and their slavish followers who champion idiotic opinions, beliefs and theories. Academic degrees and high IQ are no antidotes to stupidity.  The ideologies discussed here include communism, environmentalism, feminism, multiculturalism, relativism and deconstructionism. The gurus are the evil intellectuals that mislead so many people, whilst in my opinion those that Flynn call the "joiners" are the real morons. These are often empty-headed celebrities with no more than a superficial idea of the issues which they embrace.  The first chapter looks at the Frankfurt School that produced inter alia Herbert Marcuse, the philosopher of the New Left that exerted such great influence in the 1960s. His followers are the intolerant leftists of today who claim to be liberals. Chapter 2 investigates the revolting Alfred Kinsey, the massive hoax of his "research" and his disgusting private life. With the help of the ignorant mass media, he managed to inflict his perversions on the world.  The next chapter explores Paul Ehrlich, the false prophet of environmentalism who has been wrong in his every prediction. There is also the animal rights guru Peter Singer and the thoroughly discredited organization PETA. In the chapter Liars And The Intellectuals Who Enable Them, Flynn reveals the case of Rigoberta Menchu and her falsified history. This is an eloquent expose' of the folly of multiculturalism.  Chapter 6: The 3 Stooges of Anti-Americanism, investigates Howard Zinn, Gore Vidal and Noam Chomsky, friend of the Khmer Rouge and lately Hezbollah. These three are prime examples of shameless liars notorious for their staggering hypocrisy. Other deceptive gurus and movements explored by Flynn include Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood, WEB du Bois, Alger Hiss and his defenders, Betty Friedan and the Feminist Movement. The chapter on Postmodernism looks at the Sokal Hoax, Jacques Derrida, Deconstruction and Michel Foucault.  In the last chapter the author reiterates the motto that a mind is a terible thing to waste. He points out how much intellectual morons and paranormal believers have in common; he should have also mentioned conspiracy theorists. Anyway, the difference is that whereas society ridicules obvious cranks, intellectual deceivers often retain respectability and are showered with accolades, mostly because of the mass media morons. Flynn notes that the causes championed by the subjects of this book are often downright evil - stuff like infanticide, pedophilia and totalitarianism. Finally, he reminds us that ideas have consequences and that the lies of the ideologues must be exposed relentlessly.  The book concludes with 34pp of bibliographic notes arranged by chapter, and an index. I also recommend Hoodwinked by Jack Cashill, The Burden Of Bad Ideas by Heather MacDonald, The Anti-Chomsky Reader and The Professors by David Horowitz, Intellectuals by Paul Johnson, 110 People Who Are Screwing Up America by Bernard Goldberg and Sinisterism by Bruce Walker. These works investigate numerous influential individuals and movements whilst brilliantly demonstrating how evil ideologies function like toxic religious cults. Their fruits are disease, death and suffering on a vast scale 
 Songs like "Something" and "Here Comes The Sun" were just a hint of things to come in 1969 when The Beatles recorded "Abbey Road". George had obviously been writing songs for a few years and stashing them away. "All Things Must Pass" came out only months after The Beatles broke up and took the world by storm. The original LP set had 3 LP's inside this beautiful boxed set with a poster. What it was, was a 2 LP set with a bonus LP that was recorded during the 2 LP set (called "Apple Jam", which basically had long blues/ rocking numbers with Clapton, Harrison and Dave Mason trading guitar licks) That made this a SIX sided record. This album contains some of the best solo Beatle music ever recorded. The two hit's "My Sweet Lord" and "What is Life" are just the beginning. I would even go as far as to say that every song on this album is great songwriting. The sound is big and bold. Sometines a little too big but can easily be forgiven. It was co-produced by "Wall of Sound" producer Phil Spector. The only song I can justify calling a "filler" is "Isn't it a Pity"(Version 2). This album was #1 on the billboad charts for many weeks. It also has many famous artist's on like Eric Clapton and Billy Preston. There is a spitiual overtone throughout the album and pretty heavy lyrics. Personally, this album changed alot about the way I thought about life in general. If you want to hear what George was writing and working on while The Beatles were breaking up, I highly suggest this CD. It is timeless and a big mark in the history of Rock music 
 It is everything I expected.  It is very easy to use.  Great when making tacos, because there is so many things to slice and dice. Easy to store and clean up. 
 This book is a treasure! The wonderful anecdotes and evocative descriptions make it a delight to read in bed, and the fabulous recipes ensure that it is the most cooking-stained book in my kitchen 
 This album brings us back to the heavy Melvins, a welcome change!  They still outdo all the other "heavy" bands out there, i.e. Korn and all that other garbage.  The only thing to complain about here is that it's  only 8 songs, and one is a kind of ambient intro to See How Pretty.  This  material crushes your speakers, and it crushes live as well.  The best  songs on here are AMAZON, Manky, See How Pretty See How Smart, and We All  Love Judy.  Buzz and Dale rock on 
 Dr Clarissa Pinkola, takes you through the essence of story-telling and it's original intent of guiding and teaching. She is able to give valuable insight into life and its many challenges..If you have children, it gives a whole different meaning to reading those bedtime stories!.  This book was given to me a few years ago and it started me on a journey ..if you are not ready walk the path to authenticity then this will be a difficult read 
 It is unfortunate that this movie was not given a closer look in the theater.  Thankfully, DVD is a perfect place for fans and newcomers alike to discover Elektra.  The director's cut is a subtle and yet effective recut of Elektra.  I think that the theatrical release was disappointing to some because they were expecting a total action movie - more "four color," and what they got was more of an emotional character study of Elektra.  The director's cut emphasizes this even more.  The commentary is very interesting - it reminded me of the Daredevil commentary.  It seems that directors often do not have the control that we might think they do over the movie, and Elektra was no exception. I thought this was very well done.  OK, it's no "Spiderman 2" or "X-Men" but it's not a bad film.  The movie looks great - providing a second disc for the extras means the film looks really sharp.  The extras are plentiful.  I will admit I finally stopped watching when I reached the "historical context of the Elektra figure in Greek tragedy" featurette, but they clearly were out to make sure this was really a "Collector's Edition."  I know that not eveyone will agree with me (based on seeing this product tagged with "boring" by others) but I quite enjoyed it 
 I thought this was an excellent visual of the film.  The color plates were outstanding and the text limited.  Too much description can be boring and detract from the viewing. This book is a keeper. MKE/Huntingdon Valley, P 
 As stated in some of my other reviews, I have been greatly disappointed in the choice of quality gay literature and the talent of gay authors that we have to choose from to date.  I was pleasantly surprised by Bart Yates.  In all actuality, I give his writing style and ability five stars.  He is clever, intelligent, witty, sarcastic--a master story teller.  There is only one flaw in this book (and in some ways it is a strength).  Albeit unfair, I judge gay books by a higher standard than I do the more mainstream fiction.  I feel that gay authors have an obligation to write about gay men and women who are moral, relatively well adjusted, and non-suicidal, alcoholic, drug infested wastes of space.  I take away one star simply for that reason.  Again, the examples put out of gay men in this novel are nothing I would ever want any human being to become.  That being said, Yates proves his talent by having such flawed, seemingly selfish, corrupt character that you can not help but fall in love with.  Even as you are repelled by some of their actions and choices, you care about their lives.  That is what I look for in a book.  Make me love the unlovable.  Help me understand their motives and reasons in spite of myself.  Yates did this beautifully.  I respect an author that can make me uncomfortable in my own skin and still entice me to continue to turn the pages.  I have ordered his first book and I look forward to seeing how it compares.  While I still hope to find quality crafted literature with uplifting, realistic gay men, I am proud to have Bart Yates be one of the authors that represents the talents and passion within the gay community.  Be prepared to fall in love, be horrified, laugh out loud, shed some tears, and not be able to put this book down.  Truly an outstanding work of art.  
 If only my ignorant library had this masterpiece. It is the original introduction the squares in this country got about the Beats and it still is a great book even after the great literary miricle of Jack Kerouac's On the Road.   Ah... the Beat Generation, my only friends... 
 This book is the third volume of Jean-Pierre Vernant's work on myth and its connections beyond.  The first two, 'Myth and Thought' and 'Myth and Tragedy', develop ideas of linguistic expression, art, tradition and more in ancient Greece.  As Vernant states in the introduction, the term 'and' is a polyvalent term in English (and perhaps more so in French) - it 'can carry more than one meaning and may infer not simply juxtaposition but also association or contrast.'   One of the key issues here is the coupling, to what extent is myth present in society, and to what extent is society present in myth?  So much of what the modern world knows about Greek culture, particularly the earliest culture, is its mythological worldview and constructs, which have endured better than buildings, languages, political structures and military might.  Vernant brings modern theories to bear on the development of Greece as a culture - the first essay looks at issues of class identity and class struggle, with particular attention to the concept of slave-based modes of production and service.    The essay on city-state warfare is an important one; one of the enduring elements of ancient Greece is the legacy of the Peloponnesian war, with relationships that have direct parallels in the modern world.  Another kind of relation, marriage, is also examined here in detail with regard to myth structures - to what extent is marriage and idealised state, and how is it practiced in reality?  Vernant also looks at the pantheon of the gods as a society unto themselves, and a reflection (however fractured) of the way things are in human society.  What does it say that the myths are structured the way they are?  How can this set of stories and beings actually be considered a religion?  Vernant discusses the ideas of Louis Moulinier in this regard.  Myth changed over time in the Greek culture toward a more full development of history and philosophy.  Thucydides is held up as one of the earliest to move away from myth in his exposition of events, resisting heavy-handed application of gods and supernatural forces to the events of the world.  In addition to tracing the different ways in which myth is addressed in ancient Greek history, philosophy and literature, Vernant also looks at the development of modern thinking about this topic, including comparative mythology, anthropological/social evolutionary views of mythology, historical philology, and 'postmodern' ideas a la Levi-Strauss and Ricoeur.    For such a scholarly text, it is short on scholarly features - there is no bibliography, no index, and a relatively small amount of endnotes.  The text is not easy text to read;  this is something for scholars.  It is worthwhile in terms of ideas for those interested in the subject.  
 This is an insider's stroll through the confusing and ominous woods where the beasts of economic reality meet the lambs of social responsibility. Author and corporate survivor Jeffrey Hollender (who wrote this with scribe Stephen Fenichell) clearly admires the cast of socially responsible companies, such as Ben & Jerry's and The Body Shop. He covers the informal history of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) movement and his own troubling experiences as chief of a company that saw itself as socially responsible. His presentation is heartfelt, if short on rigorous logic. He candidly discusses having his ideals challenged and trying to justify his compromises. The book labels some behavior socially responsible and some socially irresponsible, but its yardstick is not clear. For example, it condemns the use of child factory labor in developing countries, yet never expresses awareness of the lack of practical alternatives for those children - perhaps starvation. The book explores both the value of the Corporate Social Responsibility movement and its uncomfortable contradictions. We recommend this trip inside the hard work of melding social responsibility with business 
 This book won the National Jewish Book Award, among others. The Devil's Arithmetic is the story of young Hannah, a modern-day Jewish girl from New Rochelle, who opens a door, and finds herself living during the Holocaust.   The modern-day Hannah is weary of her family's Passover Seder gatherings, especially her grandfather's rantings and ravings about the past. She knows that her Grandfather Will and his sister Eva survived a concentration camp, the only members of their family to do so. But it's hard to relate to that, in modern-day America.   When Hannah goes to the door to let in Elijah (part of the ritual), she finds herself in another world, living the life of her long-ago namesake, Chaya Abramowicz. It's 1942, and the recently orphaned Chaya is with her extended family in a Polish Jewish shtetl, celebrating her uncle's wedding day. Before the wedding can take place, however, Nazi's appear, and begin the dreaded process of "relocating" the villagers. The remainder of the book follows Hannah/Chaya's experience traveling to and living in a concentration camp. Gradually her memories of life as Hannah desert her, and she becomes immersed in her terrible surroundings.  The Devil's Arithmetic is a powerful story, utterly gripping, though not for the faint of heart. Jane Yolen doesn't shrink from the realities of the Holocaust, though she doesn't dwell on gory descriptions. The book introduces children to the story of the Holocaust in a much more powerful way than simply learning the facts ever could. Reading about the feelings of a protagonist their own age as she experiences the indignities and terrors, large and small, makes the Holocaust much more real. Though no easier to understand.   You can read Jane Yolen's thoughts about the book on her website. She says, "Writers and storytellers are the memory of a civilization, and we who are alive now really must not forget what happened in that awful time or else we may be doomed to repeat it."  This book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on June 17th, 2006. 
 I almost went with the O'Reilly book on Python, mostly because of their good reputation (Schwartz's "Learning Perl" is a classic) and their generally awesome book design. But I gotta say, I wasn't impressed with O'Reilly's "Learning Python" when I thumbed through it. So I took a chance on this one. I'm very impressed. Couldn't be clearer or more informative. A+ 
 Carter presents a well thought out and presented examination of religion in society of today.  Shoved to the outlying fringes of culture where its opinions are not granted high status or media attention, Carter shows where this has even gone so far as to redefine the word "toleration."  Although there is some of Carter's theology that is suspect (e.g. his view of creation), this work fits in the mainstream critique of American culture vs. the Christian faith 
 Every time I walked to and from work, this book's cover would catch my eye from the store window. Curiousity finally won out and I picked up a copy. I am so glad I did. It's amazing! I've tried so many other forms of Yoga, I can't believe it took me this long to get to Kundalini. This book is written from two perspectives; one from a Western doctors' and one from an Eastern Yoga teachers'. It is a really great combination. Together,they do an excellent job of specifically explaining Kundalini Yoga's many benefits to Women. It is detailed, but easy to understand. The energy and exercise sets are extremely rejuvenating and there is a spiritual component that I have  reached a stage to be able to really appreciate. There is a ton of useful information here and I have just scratched the surface.  I couldn't reccommend it more enthusiastically 
 Nicholas Sparks, with every book he's ever written, has succeeded in making me cry. And so it is, with this book, I cried like my baby sister. I strongly recommend "Message In a Bottle", it will break you.   
 I had to buy this book for a fibers class and i'm glad i did. this book is great! easy to follow instructions. if you can get the older one, the cover is much cuter! it helped me learn lots of embroidery stitches, basics of quilting, and the macrame section is great 
 This book is excellent! It has a collection of practically every beer you can think of! If you are interested in tasting various types of beers, you will love this book. It is also pocket-sized so that you can easily take it with you when visiting a pub or bar 
 This book describes one of the screwiest situations in human history.  Here it is:  About one billion people (1/6 of the Earth's population) live in crushing poverty, without reliable access to food or medical care.  A second group of people control most of the Earth's resources, and they have come to power by publicly touting their devotion to a religion whose central message is about fighting poverty.  You would think that would be good news, but it's not.  The problem is that the people who control everything, despite all the religious jibber-jabber, spend most of their time arguing about whether or not flag-burning and gay marriage should be legal.  They also like to blow stuff up.  The odd thing is that fighting poverty is much cheaper than blowing stuff up, and it's not just hippy bumper stickers that say so.  Jeffrey Sachs estimates the cost of ending extreme poverty at a small fraction of the GDP of the richest nations.  He also debunks many of the most common excuses (corruption, culture, infrastructure) that people use to justify the lack of financial aid.  These excuses generally explain why the situation is complicated, but not why it is unresolvable.  This complexity partially explains why aid to the poor is so seldom discussed in American politics, which has all the nuance of professional wrestling without the speedos.  The complex nature of the problem just means that monetary contributions are necessary but not sufficient.  What is also needed is a serious plan to get the job done, and The End of Poverty presents a reasonable first draft.  The Plan probably won't work exactly as stated (see William Easterly), but I don't see why the endeavour has to be more complicated than building a space shuttle would have seemed fifty years ago 
 A great resource for therapists. Compilation of Family therapy research. Useful reference 
 When you take a long exposure photo whith a motorized camera the batteries drain whith the first picture (four hours exposure aprox.), and you wasted 8$ or more, whith this baby you take four cheap AA batts and take the same photo for less $, the recargeable NiMh batteries are the best choice, i take a three hours and a half exposure whith this ones. For last, Adorama ship is fast and very good package! 
 Having been to Romania several times, I found this book very historical, with clear emphasis on the heart of Christian brothers and sisters.  Though the historical element of this book is written pre-1989, there is still persecution there(though much more covertly.)   This is an excellent read!! 
 Sure, this show's a bit dated, but this score is terrific & Angela Landsbury IS Mame!  Best tracks include:  It's Today Open A New Window We Need A Little Christmas Mame  [the classic!] Bosom Buddies  [hysterical duet w/ Bea Arthur] If He Walked Into My Life  [incredible 11:00 number!]  An excellent addition to any collection!   
 I love this collection. Hearing all the songs on the CDs reminds me of when I was a teenager. Bought Meet the Beatles when I was 12 and still have the original album. When I'm feeling nostaglic I just pop one of the CDs into the CD player and boom! I'm back in the 60s again 
 I killed an hours time with the book at B&N.  If you look at the reviews, the people either loved the book or hated it.  I think most people can find something thought provoking in it.    Some of her advice is very valuable for both genders: Take dating seriously.  If Prince(ss) charming didn't climb up the tower to rescue you before the age of 35, they ain't going to do it now!  Try changing your methods if they haven't worked so far.  A lot of women reviewers apparently didn't like hearing this.  The book is an interesting view into the some N.A. over-35 female minds: Many want 6 footer, 150K income, globe-trotter adventurous men who will love aging spinsters "just as they are".  This is about as likely to happen as a playboy playmate breaking into an 18 y/o boy's bedroom to satisfy his fantasy.  But the author doesn't just want to say this outright and has to use charts and diagrams to break the news to them VERY VERY gently.  The other message she tries to get across is that such women have to market themselves both by admitting publically they want a husband AND changing themselves to be attractive to men even if they come across as "desperate".  The telemarketing plan is pretty extreme but the point is that "playing it cool" isn't going to work anymore.    I may have missed the part that another reviewer found claiming that women should play the "wait for him to ask out first" game.  Men are NOT turned on by this and I find it surprising that a businesswoman would suggest such a tactic.   
 PBS did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together.  It covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films.  The documentary includes many interview pieces with Kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like.  Also, there are comments from noted Japanese film historian Donald Richie.  As a Kurosawa fan watching this on PBS when it aired, the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour.  It is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century 
 This is a great book for the whole family!It teaches kids about safety in different situations. This book will educate your children by telling them  rules like what to do in case of a fire.Also, it will teach your kids about  camping safety to water safety.Another thing this book countains is cute,  funny pictures of dinosaurs. So if you are looking for a great book to  educate your kids about safety this book is for you 
 As long as you accept this as a coffee-table book, it's very nice and relaxing to read.  Mr. Arbor's writing style is enchanting and his love of food and (the typically French) enjoyment of small everyday things takes you to another world...away from the stress and blandness.    It is quite a bit idealized, however - as one reviewer mentioned, Mr. Arbor's living style (restaurant owner, lives in France and in the US) is probably not typical.  Some of the generalizations are rather endearing:  "I've never met anyone who doesn't like roast chicken."  Cooking seems to take a solid 3-4 hours every day in the French people's lives...sometimes you wonder - when do these people actually work?  But then you begin to enjoy this book for what it is.  The recipes are lovely and not too complicated - they add a way for the reader to actually participate in Mr. Arbor's presentation of French life.  
 A paperback edition of this book was passed on to me by a close friend and I completely (admittedly, foolishly!) "judged a book by its cover;" with it's campy cover art and pink gingham trim, I figured it was some essayist's take on "Sex in the City."  Not only was I utterly mistaken, I couldn't put this fascinating biography down.  While a satisfying read, I am now only more intrigeud than ever by Dare and Edie Wright, as well as their artistic achievements.  Their uber dramatic lives remind me of other tales of the cosmopolitan glitterati...if you're drawn to stories about the Vanderbilts, Capote, Monty Clift, etc, you will like this one from the first page.  Those fabulous, flawed creative types from the 20th Century who made such a mark with their artistry, all the while self-destructing before our eyes.  Not only has author Nathan researched and recreated first rate character sketches, but tells an emotional story that will keep you spellbound long after you finish.  I highly recommend this interesting, disturbing book 
 AN OVERALL GREAT READ 
 This was a quick read and probably could be even more condensed but still good tips!  It really helped remind me of some of the more basic techniques of recording than just the "perfect" sound for drums.  Great diagrams.  If you want more advanced book, this is not it 
 Not much but where's Hiding Under Water man???  This CD is just the CD version of the previously released DVD.  However, it does NOT include Hiding Under Water or Lay Your Hands On Me which she played at that concert and are on the DVD version.  I'm especially bummed about Hiding Under Water not being included in this collection.  I could have done w/o Beth's version of Zepplin's Whole Lotta Love and would have loved to have had Hiding Under Water instead.  I don't believe this song is on any of her other efforts you can purchase.  Beth's performance is outstanding, she is an incredible vocalist and performer, every song kicks *ss!  The band is also excellent.  Beth & Co. get 5 stars but, because they left out two good tunes, the CD gets 4 stars.  
 In this fine debut novel, Chieh Chieng explores the off-beat characters of a Chinese-American family through three generations living in Orange County, California.  Louis Lum is a recent college graduate working as an underpaid fact-checker at a hot rod magazine, not the kind of position his mother Mirla had hoped for him.  Louis once reveled in rebelling against his mother; however, Mirla has recently died in a car accident, brought on when an overworked medical student, Hersey Collins, fell asleep behind the wheel, and Louis feels guilty at having disappointed her.  Louis's father Sonny calls Louis every night and threatens to murder Hersey to avenge Mirla's death.  Because Louis does not know how serious his father is about his intentions,  he moves in and stays up late with his father, listening to his father's rap records, keeping him from stabbing Hersey, and trying to figure him out.  Meanwhile Louis's feisty grandmother Esther is worried about her youngest son Bo, who moved to Hong Kong years ago and who recently has severed all communication with her.  Eventually, Esther convinces Louis to travel to Hong Kong to track down Bo to see if he is really "alive and in good health" while Esther watches over Sonny to make sure he doesn't follow through on his threats.    The narrative weaves multiple points-of-view throughout the generations to give a full portrait of this quirky family. The Lums are an eccentric, unintentionally hilarious lot, caught up more in their American life than in their Chinese ancestry.  After all, Sonny is more adamant about blacks respecting their culture by listening to gangsta rap than he is about the truths and myths about his own.  Louis speaks Cantonese so badly that, for his whole life, he has been unintentionally calling his father "Old Bean" instead of "Old Man."  Esther makes the worst turnip cakes ever cooked, botching the traditional recipe so badly that everyone ends up with stomach aches.  The story leaps backward and forward in time, from character to character, in a collage that coalesces around Louis, the youngest surviving member of a family prone to premature deaths.  Chieh Chieng brings all this together with a dry wit and an eye for the absurd.  The understated humor never demeans his characters and instead makes them more lovable.  The result is an entertaining, heartfelt book about one family's oddities and how those quirks come to define them.   
 I have read the first chapter. It is about a boy named Alexander and he thinks there is something in his barn. He is to scared to go see what it is in the barn. so he tells his friend to go see. That is all i know about my book 
 Microsoft's customer relationship management (CRM) package is now out in its third revision. The new edition is much more stable, easier to navigate around, and has numerous new features that previous users have suggested.   This book covers an introduction to Dynamics CRM 3.0 from the viewpoint of what you might call the systems administrator. That is, this book is for the person who gets the task of setting up, configuring, maintaining and especially customizing the package to suite the needs of your company. It presumes that you have at least some knowledge of Microsoft Exchange Server, Active Directory service, and SQL Server. Because of the web orientation for remote use of the system, some understanding of XML files is needed. This is not the end user book.   The book is broken down into three parts: ==Part I is on Configuration and Settings. Dynamics CRM is an extremely flexible system. Using this flexibility without putting in so many options the end user gets confused is part of the challenge of the administrator.   Part II is on customization and includes both the input, reporting and workflow areas.   Part III is on extended the capabilities at either the server end or the client side of the system as well as working with outside applications.   A CD is included with the book that includes a time limited version of the software.   This book is destined to become the Bible on Dynamics CRM 
 As a wedding officiant, I use this book with couples I officiate ceremonies for. The Rehearsal and Formation worksheets are an invaluable resource. The book also includes a worksheet to pick and choose portions from the ceremonies provided, allowing couples to further personalize their ceremony. Rev. Joel Steinebr 
 There's something special about reading a Tony Hillerman mystery. Not only are you drawn into an excellent whodunit, but an intimate look at the Navajo culture as well. In this new adventure, Officer Chee introduces us to the Tano people and their sacred kachino ceremony. However, something odd occurs at the ceremony and one of the sacred clowns is brutally murdered soon afterward. Both Chee and Lieutenant Leaphorn wonder if there is a connection to another murder on the Navajo reservation. There, a schoolteacher was found bludgeoned to death in his wood and metal shop.     The best part of this novel, besides the mystery, is the growing relationship between Hillerman's main characters, Chee and Leaphorn, and the women they're involved with. Chee tries to find away to express his mounting feelings for Janet Pete, a beautiful Navajo attorney. However, there is a catch; she might be a clan sister. The prospect of violating the incest taboo weighs heavily on Chee. In order to marry Janet Pete and still be Navajo in the traditional sense, Chee must learn whether she is related by blood. Leaphorn, struggling with the absence of his dead wife, must decide whether he is ready to move on. An attractive professor from Northern Arizona University invites Leaphorn on a trip to China. Will he go?     Although I would recommend to readers new to the Hillerman series to start with "Skinwalkers," this is an excellent, enjoyable mystery that shouldn't be missed 
 I think this was a great spin off from stargate sg-1 which was starting to get stale even though I love watching it still.  Love being able to download them all, just wish they'd get updated quicker! Honestly, when I left 2 weeks ago I saw the last episode available and I've missed the next 2 
 This book is a must have for all dog owners. This book is easy to read and easy to understand. It gives very useful insight and ideas for raising a new puppy. It is broken down in developmental stages. And also gives suggestions and ideas for training you new dog. I have read other books on new puppies and this one is the best. This should be a book breeders give to all who buy their pups no matter the breed 
 Buffalo Wagons had a grabbing attention getter in the first chapter.  It had a GREAT plot and I felt involved with the characters quickly.  The story had substance.  I read the last four chapters by candlelight because our lights went out and I couldn't wait to read more!  This is the first Elmer Kelton book I have read, but I guarantee, I will find more of his books 
 	_Designated Targets_ by John Birmingham is the excellent follow up to his earlier alternate history science fiction novel, _Weapons of Choice_, a novel that began with the basic premise that a U.S.-led multinational naval task force from the 21st century is accidentally and suddenly transported to the Pacific right in the middle of the Battle of Midway.   	As most of this fleet came into the possession of the Allied countries (basically the United States), one might think that the advanced weaponry, ships, and trained personnel from the year 2021 would enable the Allied powers to quickly defeat the Axis, as certainly anything they had could outclass anything Germany and Japan possessed in 1942. Quite the opposite occurs, as the Axis, at the heights of its power at the time the future fleet arrived (an event now referred to as the Transition), redoubles its efforts to conquer the world, benefiting from it own captured weapons, ships, and personnel from the future as well as the wealth of information in the computer databases of those ships, decades of analysis and detailed histories of the Second World War and its aftermath, revealing the results of battles, the identities of spies and traitors, failed weapon systems, successful weapon systems that should have been better supported, etc. The Soviet Union and Germany quickly declare a ceasefire with one another (Stalin thankful for the break from the Nazi onslaught and eager to begin work to avoid being the target of later German aggression as well as seeking to avoid eventual Soviet defeat in the Cold War by the United States) and both Germany and Japan rapidly develop and execute radically different plans from what they did in our timeline.  	The conflict in the book is not just military in nature, as the officers, sailors, marines, and others of the multinational task force continually come into conflict with the culture and politics of the era. Admiral Phillip Kolhammer, as Task Force Commander, is forced into politics and administration in areas and on a scale he never dreamed possible as he became the governor of a new district set up in California to house the men and women of his task force, the Special Administrative Zone (or just the "Zone"), an area that not only allowed Kolhammer's people to train contemporary personnel and set up factories to rapidly accelerate the advance of contemporary technology, gearing up to provide everything from modern medicine and medical techniques to assault rifles to missiles to jet aircraft but also to be a region of the country that was under 2021 law, not 1942 law. The latter point became particularly important in the book as while political allies, personal friendships, and romantic relationships developed between "twenty-firsts" (people from the future) and "'temps" (contemporary people; twenty-first term for people not from the future), enmities developed too. Some saw political threats with the rising importance of Kolhammer and his other officers in the Roosevelt Administration, his clashes with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, or the threat posed to some corporations that were now producing suddenly woefully obsolete items, like piston-engine fighters. Others regarded the culture of the Zone as a threat, seeing it as morally degenerate and reprehensible due to their contemporary views on homosexuality and premarital sex (or at least with their assumptions about what a twenty-first did in the bedroom). Still others didn't like the mix of races and genders in the fleet, nor Kolhammer's and others refusal to recognize segregation as well as obvious and not so obvious aid to support equality for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, nor his vehement opposition to Japanese internment (or of internment for those Japanese and German soldiers serving in the fleet, seen by opponents to Kolhammer instead as dangerous "enemy aliens"). While Kolhammer and others became heroes to some, leading several outside the Zone to begin tenuous steps towards ending racial segregation and gender bias, others saw him as a great threat. According to one of the characters in the book, these enemies saw the future (in the Zone) and it scared them.    	The action in the book is worldwide, with considerable parts of the book taking place in the United Kingdom, Germany, Hawaii, and Australia as well as the mainland United States.   	I found the many ideas explored along the way very interesting, such as the nature of copyright and patent protection for material from the future for instance. Who owns the rights to books, music, and movies say from the 1980s or the 2010s; if the company exists in 1942 that is one thing, but what if no identifiable ancestor to the copyright or patent holder exists? What happens to famous couples, fated in the other timeline to meet, now reading about how they met; do they meet at all now? Or political chances for people reading that one day they will become president?   	I also enjoyed the large cast of major and minor characters that were celebrities, some pretty obvious choices, like General MacArthur, while others quite surprising.   	I have no real complaints about the book, though I felt some scenes were a bit gory, the description of the deaths of some individuals a bit too graphic for my tastes. Overall I found the pace quite brisk and the story engaging and exciting; it kept me up the last several nights ("just ten more pages" I would say to myself, again and again before going to bed quite late). I look forward to the next book.  
 While I haven't read many of Jonathan Kellerman's novels featuring Dr. Alex Delaware (a child psychologist who does consulting for the local police, and often ends up playing detective), this one is best.  The title, which I understand, after reading the book, might be a mistake, as it suggests themes that are not in the book.  The book starts with Dr. Delaware being asked to evaluate two little girls, whose father is incarcerated for killing their mother, as the father wants visitation with his daughters, while the deceased mother's family opposes the idea.  Then, he begins receiving very strange threats, including a tape of screaming and someone chanting about "bad love."  As Delaware, and his police-liaison and friend, Milo Sturgis, investigate, they begin to uncover connections between an increasing number of unsolved murders, with a seminar, years earlier, being the connecting thread.  And, the investigation indicates that Delaware is on the killer's hit-list.  The characters are well-rounded, the plot is complex, there are some genuine surprises, and, unlike Mr. Kellerman's "The Clinic," I did not feel that Delaware and Sturgis had suddenly come up with a few new, and crucial facts, right at the end, that enabled them to solve it.  Jonathan Kellerman does go too far, in my opinion, in describing everyone and everything, in great detail, thus slowing down the pace, but the story, in "Bad Love," overcomes this 
 A heartwarming story that can be read over and over again.   There is much appeal for the youngest of readers 
 This review is for the Criterion Colleciton DVD edition of the film.  Pepe le Moko is one film which has inspired many other releases. It inspired the 1938 American film, "Algiers" and the Warner Brothers cartoon character, Pepe le Pew. It has been the subject of many parodies also.  It is about a notorious French criminal named Pepe, who is hiding out in the Casbah of the Algerian capital, Algiers. He is being trailed by the French police. They use his weakness as a ladies' man and hire young attractive woman to lure him out. He falls in love with her and that is all I want to say at risk of it being a spoiler.  The film has some fine acting and impressive scenes of the Casbah, the oldest section of the algerian capital, accessible only on foot because its very narrow streets.  There are also some really good special features, including an in-depth comparison of the film with it's 1938 American remake "Algiers," and other influences the film made. There is an interview with the director, Julien Duvivier. There are scenes from a biography on the lead actor Jean Gabin,  excerpts from a British Film institute study on the film and a theatrical trailer.  This is a great release that you will not want to miss 
 This DVD is what all YYH Fans have been waiting for since we started the dark tournament. It is a MUST for any Yu Yu Hakusho Fan 
 This game is so creative.  It's really atypical and really exciting 
 This collects issues 6 to 10 of the DC comic book series.  Yorick, Agent 355 and Dr. Mann travel west across a decimated America toward Dr. Mann's bioengineering facility in California.  The three are pursued by the cultish hyperfeminist militia 'Daughters of the Amazon' and secretive Israeli operatives.  The pace, dialogue and artwork mirror those of the first five-issue volume.  Fans of the first book will enjoy this one as well.  
 My mother bought this for my 15 month old at Christmas and he loves it.  I really like it because it's funny to read.  Just saying Neddy Buttercup makes me smile LOL 
 Okay, let's be brief: If you didn't grow up in the horror lovin' 80's or are not an established fan of Italian horror films, this movie probably won't work for you. This is the unofficial sequel to Romero's "Dawn Of The Dead" (the 1978 version of course) made primary for Italian audiences when Dawn was released there under the title of "Zombi". Even though this one doesn't take place in a mall or feature anything or anyone like the original storyline of Dawn, it does have almost the same feel. Eventually in America, this film came to us with English dubbed audio under the title of "Zombie". But now Shriek Show has finally released a remastered 2 disc set of this classic movie fully uncut for the first time in the states.  Or so I thought.  Ya see, when the movie starts, there's a brief scene set-up (as it always was), then it goes into the opening credits. I was expecting to see the original Italian credits showing it finally under it's original title "Zombi 2", like the box. But it isn't, it's the American version with the title "Zombie". Nitpicking, huh? But after a little searching I found an Easter Egg that shows that original title sequence that finally shows that this film was called "Zombi 2". Here's how to get to it (it's easy....):  On Disc One go to the "Features" section. In there, press the number "6" on your remote. It will activate a red skull button in the upper right on the screen (you CAN'T activate it by searching around the menu with your arrow buttons, very rare by Easter Egg standards!), and it will press the button automatically and take you to the original Italian opening credits and clearly show that this film was called "Zombi 2", logo and all. Also, after they're done, it will show an alternate end credits, but honestly I couldn't see any difference on them as opposed to the ones on the movie now.  All in all, this movie has never looked or sounded better ever. Some say it's looks too cleaned up now. They might have a point because the picture is so perfect now (colors bright, sharp image, brightness exact, sound crisp, etc) that it gives away the effects in the movie. Well, I'd rather have this movie perfect picture than a dark, grainy VHS anyday.  This movie is a classic piece of horror history and should be owned (especially the Shriek Show 25th Anniversary version...the extras here are superior....the making of documentary is as long as the movie itself!) by anyone with two or more "Living Dead/Zombie" DVD's already in their collection. I'm glad I got it, THIS is the way classic horror should be re-released.  P.S.: If you look hard enough (the DVD's trailer section has their previews), there is a "Zombi 3" and a "Zombie 4" movies out there too. Trust me, you don't need them or want them, as they don't have the same feel or quality of "Zombi 2" or "Dawn Of The Dead". Just be happy with their trailers. Enjoy 
 Steinsaltz, here, tells us of some very unusual people. Not only were they committed to studying the Bible in great depth, they also tried to fill in parts that were seemingly left out. Thus came the Midrash and the Halacha, which rounded out the Bible stories and laws, respectively 
  I thought this book was a thrilling book and I learned a lot about what is was like for women back in 1840 and about how Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman doctor in the United States. The book starts off when Elizabeth was younger. It talks about how she was a hardworking person. It said that in school she tried to make all of her letters as neat as the writing in the text book. Also that she wanted to do her stuff by herself like tying her shoe laces. Finally, when she was sick she even tried to cure herself. The rest of the book talks about how she tried to get into college and learn how to become a doctor. At this time there are no women doctors and no college would accept her becouse she was a woman. Most of the doctors told her to give up and treated her badly. Some time later, she got accepted into Geneva Medical School in upstate New York. She was happy when she got in but found out that it must have been a joke when she got there because everyone else was a man and she was not being treated fairly. At one point she felt like quitting but she stayed put and became the first woman doctor. When she became the first woman doctor, her example inspired other women to become doctors too. This girl followed her dream. I think this book is also a good book to learn about what it was like for women back than because it showed how just becouse she was a girl she could not do all the things she wanted to and was supposed to do all the things her mother expected her to do. For exsample, she was supposed to sew and clean. This book also was a book for learning. I would recommend this book to anyone how wants to learn about doctors and what it was like a woman in the 1840s.          
 This book, which obviously was a labor of love by the author, is simply amazing.  I purchased it after recently re-reading all of the Fleming novels.  I now realize how much detail went straight over my head.  The chronology alone is impressive, and the maps are great fun.  It would be interesting to see a follow-up for the John Gardner and Ray Benson novels (and even Colonel Sun), although this would disrupt the chronology since a 70-year-old Bond running around the later novels would seem absurd.  
 man, dolly parton never let's you down, does she? this movie has dancing prostitutes, singing cowboy-football players, and gomer pyle playing deputy fred. fabulous 
 This book does have one or two minor issues but is otherwise an excellent book for what it was intended to convey.  I was required to have this book for a project management course I just completed taking at the university I attend (as I'm one of those computer people who works in the business but is just now going back and getting a degree in it).  In my 7-8 years of experience working on numerous government and commercial IT contracts, Edward Yourdon has gotten it nearly perfect in his descriptions of projects gone awry.  I found myself just nodding and saying to myself, 'Yeah, seen that...' or 'Yup, been there...' as Yourdon describes all sorts of "Death March" projects (projects which don't have the time, funding or expertise to meet their goals - but the participants charge ahead anyway).    The sad fact of the matter, which Yourdon points out, are that Death March projects are the norm and not the exception - no argument from me there.  If you've ever wondered to yourself, 'Why is my project so F'ed up?', this is probably a good book to read to understand the big picture of how things go wrong.  I would say this would be a good book to learn from (i.e., how not to have Death March projects), but the problem is that most of the things that make projects a Death March are out of the control of the 'Average Joe' on the project.    The only issues I can see with this book, is that Yourdon offers no real solutions to avoiding such projects other than "quit" (if you can).  Although that is pretty good advice for those few in a position to do so, its little comfort to everyone else.  But then again, you just need to see this book for what it is: A study on failed projects and why they fail, and not as a remedy for fixing them.  If you do that, I think you will enjoy the book and come to an understanding of project dynamics that you may not have had before.  Who knows, hopefully you or someone like you reading it, will build on Yourdons work and come up with some real usable solutions 
 I went through 1 of these over the course of a semester, but I printed around 2000 pages when it was all said and done.  The cartridge lasted longer than any ink cartridge would have and I'm very happy with my purchase. My HP 1022 is running good as ever 
 I love this play. I love Oscar Wilde. The wit and humor of this play is astounding, and yet at the same time, it is so intelligent. I love it 
 In Jazz Cultures, David Ake (Assistant Professor of Music, University of Nevada, Reno) presents an informative and engaging history of the only authentically American contribution to world music -- Jazz. Professor Ake draws upon his expertise as a professional pianist and composer to present an impressively "reader friendly" historical survey of how jazz musicians and their audiences evolved an understanding and appreciation for this unique music which reflected the roots of the Black American subculture, went on to cross over into the dominant white popular culture, and go on to eventually achieve a world wide acclaim. Of special interest are Ake's commentaries on the concept of a "jazz standard" in the decade of the 1990s and how jazz history has never been a linear evolvement of musical styles, but a potpourri of disparate (and sometimes conflicting) creations, compositions, attitudes, performers and performances. Also available in hardcover...Jazz Cultures is strongly recommended reading for both students of American Music History and the non-specialist general reader with an interest in the development of this complex and original American musical tradition with its sometimes subtle, sometimes profound influences on 20th Century American popular culture 
 I really loved this book, as well as the whole series.  I couldnt read it fast enough 
 great story!  i like the development of the female lead, her romance, the intrigue - it was just too short

 This is the first book I read by Beth Kendrick and I will say that I was captured by the first chapter.  I am not a big fan of first person narratives, but Gwen was laugh out loud funny and her inner dialogues and observations of the things around her were terrific.  Alex was also a great character - handsome and sure of himself but not full of himself.  The book is a series of coincidences (and in a few places, contrivances) that lead Alex and Gwen from a promising beginning of a wonderful relationship to a look but don't touch "friendship," back to being together again.  How they complete this circle is the meat of the book, but sometimes that meat is just a tad undercooked.  There are a number of good secondary characters (Cesca is a riot, but there were a few moments where she got to be annoying - preaching to Gwen about one thing then doing the polar opposite in her own life). Alex was a little too hung up on his life as the child of a single parent so his decision to live with his ex, even though he really didn't want to be with her, was a tad hard to swallow considering he was usually a pretty smart and together guy.  However, despite these and a couple of other flaws, this book was a pretty decent read.  I've noticed that Beth Kendrick chooses to let her readers fill in the details of the love scenes between the characters rather than actually describe the act, and I found that to be a bit of a letdown.  There are ways to describe a love scene without getting too graphic - Nora Roberts does it all the time.  Still, the book was fast, funny, and fun.  I'm glad I read this before I read Kendrick's first book, "My Favorite Mistake."  I found myself skipping through much of that book to get to the end.  Had I read that one first, I would have missed this one and that would have been a shame since "Exes and Ohs" was definitely the better of the two 
 i have never seen rent, but the music is so good!! i love angel ^_^ well this cd is good but i think the full rent collection is way better! i luv rent! 
 I have to start my review by saying it's written on the premise that this is a fictional tale.  This is real history mixed in with fictional history (Berry gives an explanation at the end between the fact and fiction used in the book).  I also loved the DaVinci Code, which is also some fact/some fiction, and when reading it in that context, it too was fabulous, just like this book.  This was a great read and a great story.  I am a fan of the classics and I just found the whole idea of actually having the texts of the Library of Alexandria still around fascinating.  I think Berry did a great job of laying out how the scrolls would be kept and the importance they would have to the rest of the world.    Berry write exciting, fast-paced and fun-to-read books and I would definitely recommend this one!  Read it in the spirit of the book it is - a great adventure with espionage and mystery mixed in 
 I have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the Mask is no exception. I would also have to say that the Mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films. There are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but I think the one thing that shines the most about the Mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it. For those of you who don't know, a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old Tex Avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress (this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd). These kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes. Getting back on the subject, what I also found thrilling about the Mask is how well the dog Milo was trained to perform certain task. If you have seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about. The training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd. The movie itself was a take-off of the comic series of the Mask. Though not quite as dark as the comics, the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi-violence so that the Mask would not be deemed as a children's film hence the PG-13 rating. A big plus to the Mask was how Jim Carrey portrayed the different character traits of Stanley Ipkis and Stanley Ipkis wearing the mask. Another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask. And of course, who can dislike Ben Stein's typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks? Oh, and Cameron Diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well. As for the dvd, this re-release is an improvement from the previous. You get 5.1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture. The added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie 
 After reading some of the responses, it becomes obvious that few people understand the point of reference Harry Schaumburg begins with. First, he is a Christian. So, if you are not a Christian, you will not appreciate the spiritual understanding and depth into addiction he describes. One reviewer states that the author is a fundamentalist hater of sex. Ha! I have actually met Harry and that is sooooooooo far from the truth. Harry Schaumburg presents a healthy view of sex. Period. And the healthiest view stems from the Bible itself. Man...Woman...Monogomy. Period. If you go into the book expecting some "I'm okay, you're okay." Then you will hate it. To fully appreciate sex, one has to understand more deeply the created order and its implications. Harry addresses this and does not assume some feel-good pop psychology stance. Harry addresses the implications of deviating from the created order and purposes. Anyone looking for some type of affirmation for their sexual deviance, or looking for some explanation outside of scripture, needs to save their money and instead sign up for a pop culture feel-good seminar given by...perhaps, a sex therapist who is divorced, miserable, but fully competent in telling you how to conduct your sex life 
 The story drags a bit in the beginning, but by the end, my wife and I ended up enjoying the movie quite a bit.  The voice acting was great all around (especially Shatner as a possum prone to playing possum) and the CGI animation is fine.    Much of the movie seemed very familar - especially the set piece at the end which was lifted directly from the $300 episode of Futurama - but like they say, if you're going to steal, steal from the best.  Ben Folds music is another highpoint (stick around for his kid friendly rendition of Rockin' the Suburbs).  The extras are pretty good with highlights being extensive footage of the actors performing their lines, an additional cartoon featuring the original cast, and a sneak preview of Jerry Seinfeld's Bee Movie.  All in all, I recommend this to fans of animation 
 Both of my children have had this book read to them at school and loved it.  We had to own it 
 For the record, if you criticize Israel or Judaism, you are labeled anti-Semitic even if you are Jewish just like Norman. Norman has every right to go after the corporation of the Holocaust. First of all, he does not deny the HOlocaust ever happen because he himself is a product of two survivor parents. He criticizes the billions of dollars going into movies, museums, and the profit of Holocaust. He doesn't understand why some survivors are willing to sue their oppressors for money. Why would you want money even if it was yours? Norman was written in the New York Post today as being a Holocaust denier. Nothing could be further from the truth unless you read his book about the Holocaust. Norman cites and writes from a very critical point of view about the evolution of the HOlocaust from a horroring experience to a profit machine and a motive to get billions of dollars spent on memorials and museums. I know we need them but the Holocaust has become a must learn lesson in the classrooms but yet it goes on in other countries. IF you saturate students and adults with the holocaust, you are going to get a less than enthusiastic response anymore. The sympathy is long gone. The new generations of Jews don't want to hear anymore about the suffering that they have turned away from the faith. Instilling guilt and horrible memories is not going to stop Jewish interfaith intermarriage or the decrease of the Jewish population. That's what these memorials and museums is about. I wouldn't send a teenager to visit Auschwitz so they can feel guilty if they date outside their religion no more so than I would take them to prison and the death chamber. Norman makes us ask questions about what the Holocaust means to us. I know that my relatives didn't die so I can be miserable in this life 
 I am currently in my second year of college in biomedical engineering... and I almost cried when I found this book was still in print.  When I as younger, my mom used to read it to me every night before I went to bed... I'd climb into her bed and she'd read it to me.  By the time I was three, I had heard and seen the words so many times that I was able to read them.  The stories are delightful, and bring back so many fond memories.  I was looking for a birthday gift for a two year old, and now I'm going to get two, one for her, one for myself.   Oh, how time flies 
 If you were expecting to find Mount Rushmore looking out at you from the cover of this volume of the America the Beautiful, Second Series devoted to South Dakota you were close, but there is a shot of the Badlands instead.  However on the back cover there is a shot of the Mitchell Corn Palace to help put things into perspective.  I play an Internet game that tests your knowledge on everything under the sun and several times I have come across a series of questions where you have to identify if something is from South Dakota, North Dakota or neither, and I feel 50 percent more qualified to tackle that section now that I have read Donna Walsh Shepherd's book.  Her first chapter, "A Blessed Land," admits that "Home on the Range" is a song about South Dakota and covers everything everybody already knows about the state, which is an implicit promise to get beyond those items and cover much more.  Three chapters are devoted to the history of South Dakota, beginning with Chapter Two, "The Olden Days," which begins with the dinosaurs, covers the first European settlers arriving after the Louisiana Purchase, and ends with gold being discovered in the Black Hills.  Chapter Three, "From Sioux Wars to Statehood," starts with the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Wounded Knee, and the founding of Deadwood, and ends with the story of why it is we think South Dakota is the fortieth state admitted to the Union, but are not really sure (it was admitted at the same time as North Dakota).    Chapter Four, "The Century Turns," begins with the carving of Mount Rushmore and ends with a new battle for the Black Hills.  South Dakota is presented as a "Land of Infinite Variety" in Chapter Five, and notes the state is half way between the North Pole and the equator and halfway between Asia and Europe (ergo, the middle of everywhere).  Tourists will find Chapter Six, "Traveling South Dakota," especially useful as it covers what there is to see in each section of the state.  The politics of South Dakota is covered in Chapter Seven, "The Shape of Government," where lists all the state symbols from state flower (American pasqueflower) and state bird (ring-necked pheasant) to state fossil (triceratops) and state drink (milk).  The state's economy is the subject of Chapter Eight, which looks at "Cattle, Corn, and Computers."  This is also the chapter with the recipe for this book and this time we learn how to make Deviled Walleye Fillets.  Chapter Nine, "An Alliance of Friends," explains who are the South Dakotans and covers the educational system.  Finally, Chapter Ten, "Having Fun, South Dakota, Style," looks at everything from hiking trails and Black Hills jewelry to famous sons of the state such as news anchor Tom Brokaw and artist Oscar Howe.  The back of the book includes a Timeline of U.S. and South Dakota state history, shown in parallel columns, and several pages of Fast Facts with key statistics.  There are also lists of books, organizations and Internet sites where young students can go To Find Out More.  This book has plenty of photographs and original maps, and lots of informative sidebars on interesting people (e.g., Sacagawea and Senator Tom Daschle), places (e.g., Badlands National Park, and the Wall Drugstore), and things (e.g., a plague of locusts and why farm prices rise and fall).  As promised, albeit implicitly, Shepherd certainly expands our knowledge about the state of South Dakota 
 Dr. Sanders' Saints in Exile is brilliant as a descriptive work and reminds me a great deal of The Many Paths of the Independent Sacramental Movement, which describes the movement I'm a part of. She does the difficult job of commenting critically and productively from within the movement itself.  But the book is more than just a descriptive work -- the chapters "Black Intellectuals and Storefront Religion" and "The Church in Exile," as well as the conclusion, have many thoughts toward a constructive ecclesiology for reconciling churches in the United States. Those chapters rely on many insights from the previous chapters, making the whole book a must-read for all theologians concerned with race in the American church, not simply those interested in cultural features of the Holiness churches 
 Observant author, smart dog, great book!  Every once and a while one is graced with a conversation that opens the eyes and heart to the goodness in the world around us.  Not sentimental, this is a slick read.  It will keep you on your toes, it will keep you smiling, it will call you back to the bookstore to buy a copy for someone about whom you care.  
 This is fantastic the kids can play anywhere w/ this.  The seven year old can play w/ the five year old.  The five year can by himself too 
 There are precious few draughtsmen that can put line to paper in all of low/high art than he. he is a master. Take a look at "Archie and Mahitabel"; authored by the great Don Marquise.It simply does't get any better than his exquisite line 
 This book was one of the greatest books I have read about Jerry Garcia, and the Grateful Dead. It started telling his life and how he grew up, and everything. This book is worth all FIVE of the starts......If you haven't  read this book, but you like Jerry Garcia, and the Grateful Dead, then i  suggest you read this one 
 Count on Merle Haggard to give us a beautiful Christmas present -this beautiful, lush album of pop standards.  His voice, after all these years, still swoops and soars and floats through these songs.  Each number is gorgeously arranged - Johnny Gimble, Redd Volkaert and other greats contributed here so you know the music is utter perfection.  Merle's song "What Love Can Do," co-written with his wife Theresa, proves that his songwriting prowress remains fully intact - as if we needed proof of that after "Haggard Like Never Before."  What a miracle that this man is still not only in such fine voice, but also still writing songs that can make you cry.    Buy copies for everyone you love.  
 Leading the change in the contemporary business environment, which is surcharged with  chaotic competition, is becoming a serious challenge for business as well as social organizations.  In this scenario, Best Practices in Leadership Development and Organizational Change is a significant contribution towards designing change efforts in variegated situations. The cases in it are illustrations of strategies, structures and processes of leading change management by some of the best performing global organizations. David Norton of the Balanced Score Card fame had rightly pointed out that "managing strategy is, in essence, managing change." The best practice cases mapped in the book tell us how this has actually happened in some of the most successful global organizations.      These narrations and analyses tell the reader the tools and methods used in leading the change processes and help her get the answers to several intriguing questions: why some leaders are able to use these tools to change more dramatically; how successful leaders conceive new ideas, engineer consensus on their adoption and internalize them throughout the length and breadth of the organization; the constant pull and trade-off between short-term and long-term viewpoints eventually leading to a strong management process; how visionary leaders took big and decisive moves; how sense of urgency could be nurtured  among individuals and teams; how change management processes could be linked with quantifiable business results; what are the critical success and failure factors in change efforts; how vision is created and communicated to give clear mandates to people; how resistance to change is overcome in short- and the long term;  and thus how change culture gets internalized to become a way of organizational life? In sum, the best practice cases remind us  that the key to effective leadership is to stay focused on change, making all others in the organization do the same, and eventually create excitement to remain committed to change.           This book is a useful new resource for thought and action leaders in developing competitive position in today's changing business environment.  It maps the emerging paradigm of leadership development for managing change. It helps the reader designing and implementing change initiatives and evaluating their effectiveness. The book  will be seen as a professional guide towards discovering winning and successful business strategies. Corporate leaders, CEOs, boards of directors and change masters, trainers, organizational development (OD) designers and project leaders have useful lessons to learn from these best practices. The case studies themselves show that each organization is distinct in adopting their change path, processes and methods. Yet they underscore that all organizations had constant willingness to learn. Some of the other commonalities among them included: collaboration, humility, ethical working, innovation, regard for people expectation and psyche, and passion for change.  Organizations across the globe will learn important how-to lessons about the contexts in which these virtues were demonstrated and how specific measurable results were realized through leading the change effort.

 Ann, my counselor, learned me how to deal with being a HSP (hyper sensitive personality) and adviced me the work of William Bloom. Step by step I learned working with the qualities of being an HSP. The work of William Bloom helps me now dealing with the other side of the coin : protecting against negative emotions of others, separating my emotions from others emotions, protecting for hostility, ... This book is plenty of easy exercises and techniques. Maby more academic oriented or rational people will build up some resistance for this kind of work. But I prefer trying before judging ... 
 Michael Boatman is a perfect reader for this story.  His voice is casual and "philosophical".  Some of the story could have gotten bogged down in melodrama, but he keeps things on an even keel, while at the same time making the critique of life in Flint even more devastating.  Momma's smooth, cool voice almost sounds reasonable, until you realize how ruthless she is.    Well done.  One of the best audiobooks I have listened to.  
 "Lear" is not an easy play to watch by any standard, or in any medium.  Anyone who has ever wished that he or she had more money or property to leave to his or her children would do well to watch this one.  Poor families get along better, believe me.    In a nutshell: An old king creates the worst living trust plan of all time (this was before estate planning attorneys).  In a fit of fatigued grandiosity, he divests himself of his kingdom, disinherits his loyal daughter and entrusts himself to the care of his two greedy, grasping daughters.  It's all downhill from there, with a "B" plot which also follows the theme of fillial vs. unfilial adult children.  At the end, of course, there is a pile of bodies and a few stunned survivors.  What makes this Lear so special is the cast and the audience.  It was filmed in front of a live New York audience, and so you can hear the audience laughing at the jokes and applauding a particuarly good speech.  This gives the production a sense of immediacy.  In some ways, this production is sort of like watching an all-star baseball game - the players are so good, and it's a real treat to watch them.  A very young and sexy Raoul Julia plays Edmund - the seductive bad guy, and you can really see how  Lear's two wicked daughters would get into a cat fight over him.  And as Edmund's good half-brother Edgar, Rene Auberjonois is wonderful.  Edgar has to go from naif to feigned insanity to righteous warrior - quite a character arc, and Auberjonois does a fabulous job.    An unexpected favorite, though, is an actor I've never seen in anything else - Douglass Watson as the Earl of Kent.  Kent is a loyal supporter of the King who risks death to follow Lear through all his trials and tribulations.  I've always loved Kent for his loyalty - heck, I'd marry him if he wasn't fictional.  This actor brings a tremendous amount of spirit and pepper to the part - I think it's the best Kent I've ever seen.     The female roles are generally quite well acted as well, although the actress who plays Regan (I think) has kind of an annoying squeaky voice - it sounds like she's swallowed helium.  Too bad, as she's good in all other ways.    And what can you say about James Earl Jones?  There isn't much I can add to the other reviews except to say that I would be very interested to see him do another production of this same play now, thirty years later.  This Lear is quite physical, storming around the stage, frustrated by his own weakness - he can't even throw a chair in a fit of rage without falling down, but that doesn't stop him from trying. And Jones' voice is Jones' voice - is there anyone who wouldn't recognize his deep and mellow tones, even if only as Darth Vader? It is a wonderful treat to be able to hear Jones act this role. He brings a gravitas to the part which is necessary for it to be truly tragic.   But then James Earl Jones can bring gravitas to a toilet paper commercial, that's why he's The Man.  All in all, of the many Lears I have endured, this is the strongest, and I wish there were more than five stars available.   
 I am an avid fan of the German Shepherd dog and have a small library of books on the breed.  This book holds a place of honor at the top of the stack as one of the most complete breed books I have found.  It appears to be an honest appraisal and history of the breed, but with the obvious  prejudice of an owner.  Her love of her dogs shines through in amost every  page.  That can easily be fogive.  The comparison of the German and  American lines is particularly helpful.  Ms Strickland's knowledge of the  breed and many years of experience are well known and add to the  credibility of her work.  Good job, we look forward to the next update 
 Very thorough.  Easy to use.  Great detail.  We do wish it was hard covered and or a better binding.  Concerned that the binding will give in time as it is a book for the outdoors to use comparing tracks to itself 
 It takes a while to understand, but Suzuki really knew what he was talking about.  It provides a very good understanding of his take on Zen Buddhism 
 William Morris is best known for his involvement in the Pre-Raphaelite movement and as one of the greatest European pattern-designers since the Middle Ages. He was also a campaigning socialist, a pioneering environmentalist, and a lyric poet, as well as a journalist and a storyteller with a penchant for making his dreams reality. Much of his prose writings focused on the theme of an earthly paradise, which is the subject of "News from Nowhere." First published in serial form in the "Commonweal" in 1890, this novella offers Morris' ideal future for England as a pastoral society born out of revolution. A true utopian vision of the future, it is largely forgotten in comparison to the dramatic dystopian works such as "Brave New World" and "Nineteen Eighty-Four," which have dominated the interest of scholars and students.  "News from Nowhere, or, An Epoch of Rest: being some chapters from a Utopian Romance" tells the story of a young Englishman who goes to bed one night in his London home and wakes up in a strange world where his "neighbors" talk about the year 2001 as thought it had happened in the past. Morris depicts an England where radical changes have altered not only the way things look but the key elements of the society, which is now structured according to the ideals of communism. This means a world without money or private property but with a perfect equality between all citizens who share in the daily labor.   In addition to these common features of a utopian society, Morris argues that labor would be regarded as a pleasure rather than as a chore. This is possible because in the ideal world Morris envisions every citizen does the job that matches their skills and is able to take pride in the fruit of their labors. Consequently, for Morris "work" is more akin to "art," specifically in terms of the Medieval idea of individual workmanship, where even the production of a dish was celebrated as an art form. Towards this end Morris creates a future where humanity has eliminated all but the simplest forms of machinery, forcing a reliance on the individual skins of the workman. Even the city of London becomes a collection of villages in this post-industrial utopia.  At one point an old man who had studied the revolution explains what happened, which is where "News from Nowhere" gives Morris the opportunity to comment on the injustices he perceives in his own society. The revolution came when the conflict between workers and the state became violent. Unions had banded together in larger organizations and when the establishment ordered unarmed protesters to be gunned down and the workers decided to fight back. In many ways the story Morris tells through his character clearly predicts some of the conflicts that would take place between labor and the state around the world in the decades to come, but there is also a strong affinity with the story of the French Revolution.  Ultimately, "News from Nowhere" is a combination of Morris' ideal of the Medieval workman as a happy artisan and his socialist beliefs. The irony for utopian scholarship is that while Morris was prompted by "Looking Backward" to write "News from Nowhere" as a refutation of Bellamy's reliance on the modern institutions of technology and complex organizations, but today the two works are seen as being kindred spirits because they both predict a brighter future for humanity. Still, it is became Morris is looking backward from the end of the 19th century to the past to find the ideal state that should be achieved in the future, that "News From Nowhere" is one of the most atypical examples of utopian literature.    
 Probably the best strategy guide available for "Final Fantasay VIII." Great layouts, lots of pictured maps, and tremendous detailed information. Most other authors failed to explain the complexities of the game mechanics for many RPG's, but the writers/publishers of this particular book had managed to incorporate the difficult topics of the gameplay mechanics (ie) the Guardian growth system, magic system, item conversions, etc) with relative ease.  I highly recommend the guide for any fan of this game, especially from someone who considers himself a beginner for the gam 
 It's hard to explain.  This book is a masterpiece.  I have nothing more to add.  It's a master work.  Highly recommended!! 
 I have given this book to so many friends. It is terrific. Filled with tons of laughs and great stories of a true gourmand. Written in a no b.s. style that is pure enjoyment.   No recommendation could be high enough for what I think of The Raw and the Cooked 
 It's fitting that this 6th edition of Moon Handbooks Belize has won the prestigious Lowell Thomas Award granted by the Society of American Travel Writers (SATW) in the Best Guidebook category. Joshua Berman has done a splendid job adapting and updating a previous edition by Chicki Mallan - Moon Handbooks Belize has been reborn! It's a state-of-the-art example of Moon's new book design, and you won't find a better guide to Belize than this 
 An engrossing literary gem.....a rare and valuable find in children's literature 
 I bought this set on Amazon for less than $180 plus free shipping. The dinnerware arrived much sooner than expected. The set is exactly what I expected it to be. All the pieces were there, and no damage at all. It is a very nice set for special occasion. Highly recommended to all 
 I purchased this as a gift for my father, a WWII veteran and he said it is an excellent read for his generation and us 'youngsters' too 
 They are so great we need more! We have a nice size family and even after purchasing this set, my son still needs more in order to name everyone:) He plays with them each day and they seem very durable (we had them over a month now) No problems yet and he is not gently with them at times either. Great addition whether to expand pretend play with family members, friends, teachers, doctors or whatever names you want to give these people 
 There is a more to this rather small book than meets the casual reader's minds-eye. Like a puddle no more then a finger deep over some mundane surface, it can - for those who permit their eyes to focus on distant things - reflect the passing clouds, the moon or the infinite vault of the heavens.   By which I mean to say that this book is what you make it. Don't just read it. Instead, read each phrase, and then ask yourself the following questions: (1) What does it say, literally? (2) What does it say metaphorically? (3) Why is there a difference between these, and does that tell me something useful?   And your answers to question three will probably be: somethings it does, sometimes it doesn't, but it always makes me think a little, in a new way, about common but important things.    I found it fun to read, and perhaps even quite useful in an amusing way. You will enjoy it. 
 This book may seem daunting at first, but fear not.  Although it is essentially a large collection of Ronald Reagan's hand written essays on a wide variety of unrelated topics, it still makes for easy, interesting, and enjoyable reading.  It is the kind of book which you can read a bit, then put down and return to later with no loss of continuity.  And best of all, since most of the essays included in the book were written for broadcast on the radio they reflect the soft easy-going literary style of America's "great communicator."   Taken together, these works finally put the lie to the left wing's long-standing contention that Ronald Reagan was a simple minded, thoughtless actor, who somehow managed to become president and who had to be told what to do and say.  Instead, they reveal the true depth of Reagan's intellect; confirming once and for all that he was probably the most well prepared man ever to achieve the presidency of the United States.  For what other man ever researched, thought about, analyzed, and wrote about almost every important issue of his day (and many of today's), either before or after assuming the presidency?    Those who seek to dishonor Reagan and to minimize his achievements probably won't make it past the dust cover of this book.  But for those who cherish his memory, this book is a God send.  For it will reinforce their belief that he was not only a great communicator, but also an intelligent, thoughtful human being and one of America's great presidents.  
 I read Kosinski's masterpiece on the recommendation of someone who was reviewing Beah's "A Long Way Gone"--remarkable similarities between the two though one is fiction and the other memoir, one takes place in Europe WWII and the other a civil war in Sierra Leone. In this particular edition (1976), Kosinski added a fine afterward which is a must read. Though fiction, this work is fact-based. Also, though Kosinski never names the country of his setting, one can guess it must be Poland. Apparently, the Polish government recognized it also since they banned the book in that country, citing it as a serious insult to the humanity of the Polish peasant society. After reading the afterward and the story, I can only conclude if the shoe fits...   Still, there were a few things I thought to be unrealistic. Kosinski's ten-year-old protagonist is made to undergo some unspeakable tortures, tortures that would have reduced an ordinary kid to a psychological bowl of mush. Yet somehow this kid always pulls through, packing up his comet only at the last minute and heading into the Polish hinterland to rough it until he can hook up with his next tormentor. It got so bad that I began to look for parallels with Dante's Inferno. It seemed that each new torture was worse than the last, designed to atone for some imaginary sin that this innocent boy had committed. Dante borrowed from Greek mythology to formulate his keepers of hell--I wonder where Kosinski drafted his?   The damage to the boy only became apparent at war's end when he was placed in an orphanage. There he found himself in a community of similar victims his own age. The war was over, the peasants were safely locked outside the city, yet the cruelty went on, and on, and on. The gang-rape scene of the teacher was particularly poignant. Somehow the protagonist regained his humanity--at least I believe that was what Kosinski signaled his reader when the boy regained his faculty--though I never was sure how. Maybe his message was that immersed in evil a good child can be made to mimic evil--if for no other reason than survival--but when that need becomes obsolete, eventually his true nature will reemerge.  --Ejner Fulsang, author of "A Knavish Piece of Work" Aarhus Publishing 2006 
 I love sitting with my son reading this book.  The sing-song of the text has been perfect for capturing his attention from age 6 months to 19 months and counting.  The illustrations are very simple, and Carle did great to have someone else write the text for him.  I have a couple other Carle books my son won't sit through, but this is by far one of his favorite books of all time.    It's so easy, even my husband is willing to read it to him.  My son loves to turn the pages and will sit on the floor by himself and look for his favorite animals.  Plan ahead and buy multiple copies: I agree with another reviewer who had to replace a copy he had -- it gets read SO MUCH that, as well constructed as it is, the board book still goes to pieces over time.    Happy reading 
 My daughter keeps re-reading this book, and relates to the composers described. There should be more on music 
 That's the way it seemed when I read this book.  Feynman's authorial voice is friendly, intimate, unassuming, and unique.  I found it delightful.  The entire book is a gas, fascinating, and educational.  Feynman seems like just the kind of guy you'd like to hang out with.  He can be a real PITA, but also funny as hell, and always interesting.  I really didn't want the book to end (fortunately there are others by him that I haven't read yet).  Feynman has a way of thinking that moves into your own brain.  I keep catching myself thinking when faced with a problem "Now how would Richard approach this?"  There's not much hard science here but I did get a good sense about some aspects of the sociology and methodology of contemporary physics.  Feynman also has interesting ideas about art, music, culture, and people.  Some of the anecdotes are historically important, especially the episodes at Los Alamos.    Feynman seems to be painfully honest in places--how many would admit to peccadilloes like spending six nights a week in a strip club--but elsewhere his anecdotes seem confabulated.  One description of a philosophical discussion at Princeton when he was a grad student there is absolutely implausible unless Princeton philosophy grad students were a lot worse than I'm sure they were.  This is something I know something about.  That conversation did not take place the way Feynman describes it.  Who cares?  (I do a little.)  Also Feynman takes a completely gratuitous pot shot at the Cornell philosophy department, which at that time and still today is one of the best in the US.  Feynman is also a bit of a phony, especially in his apparent distain for the Nobel Prize.  I guarantee you he would have been mortally crushed if he had not gotten the Nobel (and rightly so!).  He's also overbearing toward the end of the book where he discusses "cargo cult science," although the basic point that Feynman is trying to make is deeply important IMO.  The thing is the guy's human, very human; he comes across that way--fleshy, a little nerdy, excitable, not always dependable, compulsive, and unpredictable, self-involved, cool sometimes, brilliantly original in an unpretentious way sometimes, and a great story teller.    Reading this book is a wonderful very human experience 
 Love is in the air of Lake Eden, Minnesota as Hannah Swensen, proprietor of The Cookie Jar bakery looks forward to the Valentine's Day wedding of her employee Lisa to policeman Herb Bessemann.  However, life is not all hearts and flowers at the Cookie Jar, as the bakery's business has trickled to almost nothing with the opening of a rival cookie shop across the street called The Magnolia Blossom.  The Magnolia Blossom has just been opened by two sassy southern sisters who are giving out great promotional deals and plenty of flirtation along with their cookies, which turn out to be quite mediocre.  But the novelty of the new store and the scoop-neck blouses worn by the sisters seem to be bring all the cookie business in town to their store.  When Shawna Lee Quinn, one of the southern cookie divas, is found shot to death in her store kitchen the morning after Lisa and Herb's wedding, Hannah enlists her sleuthing friends to try to determine whodunit.  Hannah feels she must clear herself from suspicion of the murder, as Shawna was not only her baking rival but also seemed to be quite friendly with Hannah's sometimes boyfriend, deputy Mike Kingston.  Hannah and sister Andrea are also grappling with their widowed mother's new boyfriend, a slick newcomer to town named Winthrop Harrington the Second.  Their mother seems to be falling hard for the sauve Englishman, and the girls are worried that her mother is being taken advantage of.  I gave this book only 4 stars because the murder mystery plot was a bit thin, in my opinion.  I did enjoy the recipes included in the story and look forward to trying several of them.  I felt that there was a better mix of recipes to story in this installment of the Hannah Swensen mysteries.  It seemed to me that some of the previous books had way too many recipes.  This was an enjoyable story, and one that will be especially enjoyed by readers who look to bake 
 I like this book because the author has obvious connected with Dragon. They have been much maligned in historical fiction what with stories of captured maidens and stealing gold and so forth. One might wonder why Dragon, with no use for such things, would go to the bother of stealing them. But of course, people tend to not wonder, do they? Those stories are entirely fictional and, of course, do not really represent Dragon at all. What are Dragons, then? They are highly spiritually evolved beings who chose not to continue to incarnate on this earth in order to help us and guide us from the spirit world. They are some people who are lucky enough to be born especially dear to a Dragon, and they have a lifelong Dragon guide from birth. For others it happens differently. Regardless, an actual Dragon spirit is not common as they were earth beings and so, obviously, limited in number. And whether we learn to connect with Dragon energy or we become able to connect with an actual Dragon spirit, Dragon is a loving, fiercly protective energy and being and should always be treated with respect and honor. D.J. Conway understands that, and so I recommend this book. It is a beginners' book, but there is always something for the "advanced" to learn in these books. No one person knows it all 
 This was not one of Mrs. Michael's best works, but it still wasn't half bad. I enjoyed it, even though it was a slow read. I found it interesting, but didn't have any trouble putting it down. The ending was very climactic, but after the slow pace set in the previous pages the ending felt way too rushed 
 Well, being that I absolutely love STP anyway, it was going to be hard for me to give this anything less than 5 stars. True, this album is remarkably different from their previous efforts, but in no way is it inferior. In fact, I think that it is excellent in the sense that they showcase that they can not only pump out the usual hard rocker (Dumb Love, Long Way Home) but that they have also progressed and can show different sides (Hello, It's Late, Too Cool Queenie). Yeah, this album for the most part has more "soft" singles than their other albums, but still, IT'S GOOD!!! I mean, come on! Led Zeppelin's third album was "softer" than anything they'd done up to that point, but I doubt any Zep fan would pan it just because it didn't have an over abundance of radio-friendly hard rocking tunes. I love their soft side just as much as their gritty, no holds barred approach to music. Folks, this is a good album, and sadly, the last this great quartet gave us. If you like STP, it is more than worth purchasing 
 After following the advice in this book for four weeks, I'm within 20 pounds of my goal weight for the first time in five years.  I've done Atkins and South Beach, but my weight loss would always stall after the first two weeks.  Jim Karas' approach involves getting you to first believe that you can follow a sensible, effective weight loss program, and then he gives you the diet and exercise guidelines you need.  Yes, you will have to exercise, resistance/weight training is crucial, and you will have to follow an eating plan that asks you to burn more calories than you take in.  All I know is, I feel and look better than I have in years

 I'm writing this review before seeing the DVD but by the looks of it, it should be a nice set to own.  I wonder when the audio commentary was recorded since Anthony Ainley passed away a couple years ago and he is listed as providing audio commentary.   These three stories released as one set is a unique approach as it features both Tom Baker and Peter Davison and emcompasses two stories from Season 18 and one from Season 19.  But the stories really are connected by the rebirth of the Master as well as the regeneration of the Doctor.  
 Michael Connelly shows why he is the best writer within his genre.  Harry Bosch receives a call that there is a confessor to the murder of a young woman from 1993.  Harry worked the case and it has haunted him for over a decade.   When a visit to the murder site goes awry, Harry begins to suspect that things are not as they seem.  He begins to dig deeper and uncovers angles to the case that he never knew. An excellent thriller as usual with twists till the end 
 beautifully written, this book is useful for anyone studying any kind of martial art or any art where high level of skill is required. 
 I have read this book and have given it to many of my male friends as well as their sons. It is a very good book to get someone who loves football and who hates to read, reading again. One young man I gave it to is a devoted Raider fan and he thanks me all the time for this gift. This is an enlighting book for a fan of any team. I read it myself and as a woman who grew up with and occasionally watch's football, I found it very informative. It is a book that NEEDED to be written. It is nice to know their are Doctors out their who can't be bought and have the integrity of Dr. Huizenga 
 Essential is right. This is 20 plus issues from the early days of Peter Parker's adventures as Spider-Man and some of the best. The storytelling by Stan Lee, the art by Steve Ditko...it's all here and it's all great. Memorable villians, fun stories, great artwork. This is a must-read for any Spidey-fan. I had a great time reliving old memories of the days I read these as re-prints in Marvel Tales 
 Influenced by his love of quilts, photographer Roland Freeman acts as anthrolopologist and quilting historian in this beautiful, comprehensive book. Featuring full color photos of African-American quilts and quilters and well-researched text, this book is a must-read even for non-quilting enthusiasts. The history and cultural heritage of a people have been preserved in this beautiful artform. I found myself moved after reading this book. You will be too 
 All too often we read about the awesome success stories of mountaineers. I like how Jim shares his successes and failures on the world's highest mountains. Although Jim's adventures are on a grander scale than my own (see Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection), we both go out of our way to share the "failures." When facing the extreme forces of nature, you can't always reach the summit. There are many times you must choose between attaining your goal, or surviving. Jim had the brains to choose life when faced with many decisions that could have cost him his life. I was pleased to read that we both regard Reinhold Messner as the greatest mountaineer of all! I also enjoyed hearing about Jim's struggles to balance his climbing desires against his family's needs. There is no doubt his family suffered while he was out fulfilling his mountaineering desires. On one hand, he had to climb while he had his health and youth. On the other hand, he lost invaluable time with his family that is forever lost. Even though I've fantasized about devoting years to climbing like Jim did, I realize that you have obligations once you decide to become a husband and a father. My family comes before my "selfish" desires of climbing 
 This is a very special album. It is one of the best of Joe Henderson's many wonderful recordings. His playing on this album is just sublime; so expressive and yet restrained. This is a cd I shall listen to many times and highly recommend it to Amazon customers who seek a wonderful introduction to Jazz, or for those who, having liked Jazz for many years, want to hear Jazz musicianship in its highest form.   
 Belle & Sebastian's first album, which was the result of guitarist/ Vocalist "Stuart Murdoch's finishing his 'Music Business Course'.  And this proves to be a perfect introduction to those new to Belle & Sebastian,  as it's here that you'll find the artistic and musical templates that the band, would work up and constantly refine over the course of the successive albums, resulting in 2003's superb "Dear Catastrophe Waitress".  Songs that on first inspection had a intensely optimistic twee sound, hopelessly saccharine, on the first couple of listens deceivingly disposable.  But throughout the album, the instrumentation is first class with all band members giving incredibly robust performances in their playing.  And on closer inspection the lyrics proved themselves to be intensely sarcastic and witty and brimming with a subtle intelligence.  The seven-piece band has an intimate, majestic sound that is equal parts folk-rock and '60s pop, but Murdoch's gift for not only whimsy and surrealism, but also for odd, unsettling lyrical detail keeps the songs grounded in a tangible reality. Unquestionably one of those bands that on first listen will leave most listeners scratching their heads, as to what all the fuss is about. But once that initial reservation has been overcome, and the music has had a chance to suck you in, you'll most likely see, why they've managed to build up such a devoted following.  It should be mentioned again that those entering into the world of Belle and Sebastian, would be very well served making this their first album to purchase, as it beautifully illustrates their humble musical beginnings and how they developed and refined their sound and songwriting as a group, which is not to take away anything from this truly superb effort 
 This book exposes the tragedy of individuals trapped in a rigid and suffocating life that they did not choose, and sometimes cannot leave.  Those who try leave are unprepared for life in the mainstream, and may feel like they have to start again from the beginning -- educationally and socially.  Some can make it, and others are trapped somewhere in between the two worlds.  The religious lifestyle is wondeful and fulfilling for many, but awful for some.  The book reveals a tragedy that is occurring right in our backyard (here in New York City).  The story is riveting from beginning to end.  Currently I am tutoring for the GED a man from an ultra-Orthodox background, and he is angry about having been denied the opportunities that were available to everyone else.  He is about 10 years behind his American counterparts, and really struggling to catch up.  I would be angry too, if I were him.  I also know other ex-ultra-Orthodox people, and I think the book paints an accurate picture of their transition, although of course it's different for everyone 
 Wow what a album.When the first album of Armik RAIN DANCER released my friend told me about this album that nobody can strums the guitar like amik i asked him  to lend me the cd for few days and he gave me the cd to listen  to Armik first album i was thinking that maybe this album will be good or  not.Well when i listened to the armik i was not in myself i was somewhere  else i was dreaming.FOR ANNETTE the first track of RAIN DANCER was very  soft track i was impressed by the first track.And when i listened to the  last track of RAIN DANCER that is ZINGARO not me whomever listen to this  track will start dancing .I listened to each and every track of RAIN DANCER  and they are all awesome. Whenever Armik strums the guitar the birds sat  down on the stems of the trees and started listening to the armik the  passion.i think armik is great guitarist in the world and i really  appreciate  him 
 69 Reviews with none lower than 3 Stars!  Wow.  That should tell you that you have something special here.  But will it work for everyone?  No.  Simply put, while some kids will learn and will want to read more and more of the little books, others won't.    My two could be a classic case in point.  My daughter learned to read with the first 4 of the Level A books but had no desire to 'keep going'.  For whatever reason, while the books gave her initial confidence, she wasn't all that interested in Mat and Sam and their adventures.  Enter my son, now almost 4.  I just now got the books from the Library to try with him.  He LOVES them.  He thinks Mat sitting on Sam is hysterical.  He sat down (a minor miracle in itself) and read 4 books in one sitting; having never read *anything* before.  [He knew his letters and their sounds before, of course.  From the Leapfrog videos... but hadn't actually ever read a sentence before.]  Five Stars.  Great product.  Really works.  Might not be a favorite with every child, but at this price it is well worth trying to see if it is.  
 I'll begin with saying that Vangelis has brought the most beautiful melodies out synthesizers that I've ever dreamt of.  Jon Anderson's angelic voice and his touching lyrics only add to the beauty and the overwhelming integrity of this album.  The song 'So Long Ago, So Clear' is easily one of the best pieces I've ever heard.  This is the only song on this album that features Jon Anderson.  I think that this song fits in with the rest of the album very well.  After years and years of listening to this album on my dad's turntable, I decided to purchase it on CD.  The quality of the recording is good, and the cover of the album is very nice as well.  If you like this album and this style of music, then I'd definitely recommend other albums by Vangelis such as "Private Collection" and "The Friends of Mr. Cairo".  Both of these feature Jon Anderson.  Absolutely amazing... 
 This book is an excellent resource for anyone studying terrorism.   I used it as part of a bibliography for my final Army War College paper.  Though the paper was about National Missile Defense, I found an incredible amount of data I could use.  It is sober, insightful, and easy to read....unlike many books on the same topic.  I have loaned my copy to other Army officers as a primer for curent events.  Hope I get it back 
 This is one of the best cd's I've owned in a long time. I've been following Reb since Winger seperated. This is his the best Reb and Kip have sounded since Pull.  For anyone who loves in your face melodic guitar rock, this is the album for you.  Rock on Reb! 
 I've been using Python for several years, and prior to buying this book had messed around a little with wxGlade.  I heard an interview with the authors on the Python411 podcast and became intrigued by the idea that it's possible to handcode a GUI app in wxPython (particularly by the suggestion one of the authors made that it's best to understand how to code manually before moving to a GUI builder like wxGlade).  Imagine a GUI toolkit that can be handcoded in practice!  Well, I've been reading the book and have found that it's improved immeasurably my understanding of the details of the toolkit, and has also provided more general background and patterns for following MVC with wxPython.  Great job, Noel and Robin.  You've produced a book that's clear enough for those just getting started with wxPython but also manage to include examples and discussion of more advanced topics and approaches.  You took time away from coding to write the book, but the result is a product that's valuable to current users of wxPython and will likely expand the userbase (hey, this isn't harder than Tkinter!) 
 this second book of Dan Brown is a joy to read. For readers interested in historical places such as Rome, this book points out several new facts unknown to most of the readers, although many of them have been to Rome before.  The story is thrilling and keeps the reader interested, wanting to know what happens next. Dan Brown's explanation about the Illuminati is well documented and tickles of the curiosity of the reader. The illustrations in this book are beautiful done and helps the reader to understand even more the setting of this compelling novel. Due to use of larger typing, it's easier to read (for instance in bed with less light). 
 During 9/11 and the subsequent invasion in Afghanistan, David Rees was a temporary employee at Martha Stewart Omnimedia (Probably not the best place for a long term career). He then started a cartoon strip that has been called the intelligent response to the War on Terrorism. Anyone who has ever worked in a cubicle will immediately identify with these cubicle denizons who spend their life on the phone solving the world's problems.   The book, printed in the signature red ink it is a collection of cartoons that would otherwise be lost in the day to day trash with the newspaper. And for those who don't live where this strip is available, here is a single dose of wisdom on the Antrax scare, sovereignty in Iraq, and more 
 I saw this several times as a kid and it always stuck in my head.  It's a beautiful English production that has a definite melancholy, bittersweet flavor that's missing from other adaptations.  Really worth seeing.  It is a kid-friendly version?  Not really but smart teens may enjoy it.  Great performances from Ralph Richardson, Peter Sellers and Fiona Fullerton as Alice 
 One of Hank's best works in the 80's. Wild Streak is "Living Proof" that Hank has the right stuff. And is not affraid to speak his mind. I remember a local tavern had to take "If the South Woulda Won" off the jukebox because one or two lines in the song offended a couple patrons?  So if your into love ballads or kick $#@ country. Then this is the classic Bocephus CD for you 
 Lots of delicious and easy recipes and tips.  No low carb dieter should be without it 
 Was told by a friend to read this several years ago, I finally read it and learned alot. I reccomend it to any book reader 
 The book is decent. To be honest though, reviewing textbooks is kind of funny. Does it matter what I say? I suppose if you're ordering this book because you honestly just have a burning desire to learn about essential cell biology, well... the more power to you. You'll learn it just fine from this book. If you're just buying the book because it's the required text for your college class (like I expect), well yeah, doesn't really matter what I say, does it 
 I would recommend this CD. A friend of mine had this Cd, I liked it so much I had to get my own copy. I have also had a lot of other friends ask about this CD.  I'm not a deticated fan of tis music as others may be but if you are oing to start anywhere, this is one you want. To me, all the songs are gtreat to listen to. The songs will take you to another world 
 Lb. for lb.,if the two greatest Jewish boxers,Benny Leonard and Barney Ross had collaborated on a book,maybe they would beat Prager & Telushkin-but only by split decision.Rabbi Joseph Telushkin is probably the most accesible and clear-headed Orthodox-certified rabbi/writer ever & I probably have bounced more ideas off Dennis Prager than any other "thinker".Unbelievably,to date,they are the only two  writers I know of to cite Hitler's response to a rep from The Vatican in 1937,originally from Armen Robinson's 'The Ten Commandments'.Hitler told the rep from The Vatican that his problem with the Jews was 'The Ten Commandments and The Jews tyrannical God.'Why The Jews' which has been reprinted with the latest chapters in Jew hatred,is worth buying for "the Ten Commandments" issue alone.It was said that Benny Leonard did more to combat antisemitism than any number of books-possibly with the exception of 'Why The Jews' 
 Very important information to help anyone with carb counts. Highly recommend. 
 Liza has a pretty normal life in New York, living with her parents and brother and attending a very small private school.  She has a couple of friends but has never really connected with anyone in her class.  Liza is just biding her time until she goes to MIT to study architecture.  One day while she is at a museum trying to gain inspiration for a senior project, she meets Annie, a girl with a beautiful voice and dark secretive eyes.  Immediately Liza and Annie hit it off.  Liza isn't sure why she is so drawn to this girl, but she knows that she is happy whenever Annie calls and is thrilled and nervous to be around her.  When they are together, Annie and Liza are hesitantly getting closer and closer until one day Annie kisses Liza.  Liza isn't sure what to do or how to react, but she knows that she feels more for Annie than she has ever felt for anyone in her life.  Gradually she begins to come to terms with the fact that she is probably gay.  Life as a gay teenager is difficult.  Annie and Liza are always worried about showing affection for each other, and there is no place where they can really be themselves without being found out.  Then Liza agrees to feed the cats of a couple of teachers at her school who live together.  Suddenly there is a private place for Liza and Annie to go.  But will the fact that they are carrying on a relationship there jeopardize the careers of the teachers who live there?  I loved the characters in this book and the sensitivity with which they were portrayed.  Annie and Liza were very realistic and easy to sympathize with.  I also liked the way the story was told, alternating Liza trying to write a letter with her memories of the previous year.  I was mostly happy ith the ending, too, although I didn't really like the way Ms. Widmer and Ms. Stevenson accepted their fate without a fight 
 Another great score for James Horner. The first track is great and magestic. But sounds like the other scores Horner has composed. The only downside of the CD is the lengthy tracks. After 6 minutes, my attention  span begins to kick in. But a great score 
 Sykes does a great job of describing the ever growing/replicating pathology of victimhood in this book.  Having been on the front lines of Political Correctness (as an art critic for Art Paper and other magazines) I can personally attest to the accuracy/veracity and utter relevance of Sykes's descriptions.  I once attended a so called performance at Intermedia Arts in Minneapolis called Six Heads.  A very bad actress in a wheelchair with a stack of fake dynamite started ramming the audience who were forced to sit on the floor in this cramped space.  As she rammed, she tried to blame/shame ancient Greek civilization for not being handicapped accessible.  Need I say more? Yes!  Victims of the world: GET A SPINE!  Jaye Beldo:Netnous@Aol.Co 
 My fiance bought this coffee maker at Wal-Mart on sale.  It worked flawlessly for a week or two.  Then I thought it would be a good idea to put a tea bag in the compartment where the coffee goes.  My fiance told me later that the instructions advised against that as it might damage the unit.  In the next day or two the unit malfunctioned - it would buzz and then two blue lights would blink.  Sometimes we could unplug it and start over and it would work but the problem seemed to become more frequent (and frustrating).  I noticed that the lid locks in place while the unit is brewing, so the round top part inside apparently rotates and locks into the bottom part (where the pods go).  It occurred to me that the buzzing sound is the sound of the locking mechanism rotating into place and that's when the problem occurs (intermittently).  So we started pressing down on the lid before clicking the brew button and it always works fine when we do that.  (Apparently if the lid doesn't close snuggly then the locking mechanism jams and you get the blinking lights and must then reset it by unplugging it.)  I hope this review helps anyone else that is having this problem.  I've seen several comments from others having the same issue.  Other than this one issue which turns out to be minor if you know the workaround, we love this coffee maker!  We also use it just to make quick hot water for ramen noodles or tea (but I don't put the tea bags in the machine any more, just in the cup!).  We've had it for a couple of months now and use it at least once a day, usually more 
 THe minute I started reading "Zabelle" all I could think of was what happens to her next.  What a remarkable lady what a beautiful life story.  I am so glad Nancy Krikorian decided to narrate her life so all of  us could share and in someways make "Zabelle" a part of our lives  forever.  If Nancy Krikorian's goal was to eternalize "Zabelle",  well I think it worked, whoever gets the opportunity to read this Novel  will never forget Zabelle and each time they remember her their faces will  light up with a smile becasue durig those few moments each and everyone of  us went back in time and re-lived the life, hardship and joy of our  ancestors 
 I own a lot of Asian movies. They are different from western movies. I really enjoy them. I own most of Yimou's movies. He is an excellent director. The very enchanting Gong Li stars in a lot of them and is quite an excellent actress. A lot of his movies have a political statement. You will find an excellent story of a woman married to an impotent man. Has a child by another. She's abused by this old impotent man throughout. I won't ruin it,but I really enjoyed it. Buy Shanghai Triad,Temptress Moon,Chinese Box,Qiu Ju,Empress Dowager,Emperor and the Assasin,Zhou Yu's Train and Soul Haunted by painting. Gong Li is an excellent actress and called the best in China. I believe it 
 This is a classic we wanted our grand daughter to read. The illustrations are professional and wonderfu 
 My wife is a big fan of Little Mermaid and half jokingly said she wanted an Ariel watch for Christmas.If you want Micky, Minnie, Tinkerbell, Winnie or the 3 princesses, you're in luck - their easy. Ariel, for adults anyway, is darned hard to come by.  This was the ONLY decent Ariel watch I saw. Even then, I had to buy a new band for it as this is a kids watch. As for the watch, it really is a nice looking watch and if you put a "real" band on it, you'd never know it was a kids watch. Anyway, she liked it and I'm a hero 
 Last summer I got a case of insomnia that only let me get about 2 hours of sleep a day for almost 2 weeks.  Like many people I found that many doctors and so called sleep specialists really don't know that much.  I was falling apart and I was scared.  I was on my way to making sleep medications a regular part of my life when I found this book. It helped me get off the sleep medications and get back to sleeping normally.  The methods used in the book are all based on good science and proven practices.  The methods are holistic.  You will not only sleep better, but you will be a healthier and happier person.  As someone pointed out in one of the earlier reviews this information is found in bits and pieces on the Internet.  This book is the result of integrating and studying all of those bits and pieces as a whole.  As such it is far more valuable.  I agree with the others that the tone of the book in the first chapters can be improved, but the book is good enough that it is worth rolling your eyes and reading through the whole thing.  I think it also would have been more useful to mention the relaxation tape by the author in the front of the book, instead of at the end in fine print.   Since I didn't discover it until I finished the book I never tried it as I did not need it, but I think it could have been helpful 
 I have just recently been introduced to Trungpas work, and this book really changed the way I, as a young person, go about being "free". I certainly recommend this to anyone looking for freedom of the mind. 
 Considering that three of the four of the novellas were made into major motion pictures, the pictures do capture the essence of the original text.  I saw the film, "The Shawshank Redemption" before having read the novel, and I couldn't believe that such a story line could fit into so few pages!  King touches upon many tastes in this novel.  I think that "Apt Pupil" tends to be the most "horrific", and suprisingly, is my least favorite.  As an animal lover, I object to some of the actions in this story, but it didn't stop me from reading or loving the story.    If you're not a typical King fan, this book my change your mind, at least for the length of the novel.  His "narrator" theme is always someone involved in the story, and not your omniscent or first person, either.    Give it a try, it is highly recommended. 
  As one that lives "off-grid", drives a VW diesel, makes my own fuel from both Biomass and oil sunflower seed grown on the property and as much food as I can with my limited energy and water available..all electricity is from PV and a small Wind genny..all water is roof catchment.. I feel compelled to express that even with all of these steps toward the right direction there is still the Social view of all of our lives!!   Yes..I have done much to reduce my Carbon footprint..yet I cannot get my consumption to the level yet to prevent a St. Mattews Island Reindeer disaster. I need help fellow Citizens of the Earth!! We are all on an island, and there are critical decisions that cannot wait for Governments. I implore you as educated and involved humans to take this work to heart for what it is. The canary in the mine! ACT! Change your lighting to at least CF's or even LED if you can afford them. Stop buying and using the iron beasts that Detroit seems unable to stop building. Look more to the long term efficiency and costs to all when purchasing appliances. How many clocks do you need in the house for Pete's sake? Put every electrical device on power strips and shut them down when not in use. Buying a Computer? Take a look at Home Powers new issue for comparisons of energy used by which makes and types. It will surprise you!! Plan your trips as best as possible or even move closer to the workplace, if you have one.   Support Renewable Companies as I do in your investing..in other words VOTE with your Dollars! These are all beneficial ideas to slow the consumption. This will assist in getting the States back on our feet and hopefully be Leaders in the World again. These also will help your family personally in savings over time..not to mention your grandkids and generations beyond and the World they will inherit. The first step to a life "off grid" is education, then to reduce consumption. You must know where you are now in order to see where to go from here. You'll be surprised how easy it is, because you will become aware! Identify the culprits and then cut them off or reduce the use to the very minimum possible.   I've read The Party's Over as well. A bit dated now but also accurate and to the point.   Truely; I wish the best to all..and that myself and others that have taken this seriously over the past years, and have taken proactive steps are joined by many others before it is too late. You do not need to wait for Washington or Detroit or any other Ogliarch to determine your choices!! If your reading this and interested in this book you are already moving to the correct point of view. Start with this book and look into Home Power magazine as a next step. It's on-line, offers a complimentary first look, and totally honest, inexpensive, and REAL information presented by people like myself across the Planet that are actually doing this now. To us this is not theory..it is how we live and will live until we live no more. I have no interest in returning to my formerly excessive consumptive lifestyle, even if I could I would not.      
 I am a big fan of poetry and this book did not disappoint me. I live in Australia, and therefore am not exposed to what is au courant in the US anymore [originally from the US]. I saw Kay Ryan on the Lehrer Report which is broadcast over here. She was reading from this book, and I decided to buy a copy. The poems are earthy and touch places of the heart that elicit a sigh of recognition. It is good to read poetry that is open, uncoded and taps into our everyday experiences with such elegant simplicity 
 I am a veteran marching member of the Drum and Bugle Corps fraternity. I also had the extreme honor and pleasure of being instructed by Mr. Jim Mason and marching with his brother Marty in the Madison Scouts. Blast is the greatest testament to the talents of the Drum Corps fraternity.  BRAVO 
 If "Man is the measure of all things," then Shakespeare is the measure of all things that comprise "The Western Canon." I say this because Shakespeare appears to be Harold Bloom's Zarathustra (in the highest and best sense of the word). And he exalts the Bard of Elizabethan England to the level of an avatar of Dionysian/Apollonian proportions, only concealed in part behind the masques of tragedy and comedy as he sweeps across the world stage.   Literary criticism is "perspectivism," a technique once employed by Nietzsche as he railed against the decadence and resentment of his age. Bloom puts Nietzsche's perspectivism to good use as he critiques the literary criticism of our own age. He begins by invoking the immortal poets. We soon discover what bright stars they are as his performance becomes a haunting aria and he cries out in anguish at the "Twilight of the Idols." Bloom's exasperation with the demise of epic literature in our time reminds me of Nietzsche's madman proclaiming that "God is Dead!'' Is this the new nihilism?  Bloom exerts himself beyond all bounds in this book. His mission is nothing less than our total conversion to the Western Canon, that pantheon of "liberating gods" that Emerson believed all great poets to be! And he succeeds! We come to believe in the secular immortality of all those who struggled to pen "the Third Testament" or simply tell tales that enrich our souls, and sharpen our sense of human nature.     The "Canon" took off like one of Von Braun's rockets when I read Bloom's exegesis of "Goethe's Faust, Part Two: The Countercanonical Poem." I have never read a more powerful essay on the canonical versus the counter-canonical, which is, it seems, the key to the nihilism that lurks within the daemonic tale of Faust.  In it we already see the seeds of Nietzsche's Ahab-like attempts to harpoon his own White Whale, which was really the God of Abraham. Melville understood this nihilistic urge to slay the Deity with gnosis. He foresaw the consequences of it and instead wrote a "Third Testament," Moby Dick. Thus, Bloom is wise to lament the slow death of the Western Canon as we descend into our modern Hades of MTV and Virtual Reality, for McLuhan's prophecy of debased literacy in the electronic age may soon come to pass. But alas, this book will at least remind us of the glory that was once "The Western Canon." May it shine on forever!       
 Provides a great overview of the desirable characteristics of any work enviornment, but presented in a very easy to read and understand way.  Read it easily in a day but can put the principles to work immediately.  Heard about Pike's Fish Market for a long time and am glad to hear the "real" story 
 I bought the 3.5 x 5.5 ruled pocket version. By my standards, the best notebook I've ever used. The perfect size for my jacket or pocket. Acid free paper for long-term archival storage of my notes. Good to use an acid free ink for even longer storage (gel ink pens do not work well with the Moleskine's paper though). Looks professional, and I get a lot of nice comments about it. Much easier to use than turning on my PDA and slowly typing in notes with my thumbs. I also really like the fact that it will open completely flat on a table for easier note writing and reading. When this one is full, I plan to buy another. Price is higher than most, but with this Moleskine, you pay for the quality 
 I was born in 1931 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvina.  That was way before TV.  I remember all these artists and the songs.  When they were appearing in Pittsburgh or Wheeling West Virginia (The WWVA Jamboree) I would be right there in the front row.  I loved the music when it was Hillbilly, then country western and than The Nashville Sound.    I am so thrilled you recorded all the greats on one CD.  I love it and am so happy to be able to purchase it.  PS -- I had all the 78rpm records, but over time they got lost.  Thank you for putting them all on one CD. Dorothy W. Ross 
 I was reccommended to read Planet of The Blind due to my interest in writing stories about people who had disabilities and about by own disablility for I'm visually impaired myself and I have an interest in writing. So I read Steven Kuusisto's book Planet of the Blind and found it very facinating and inspiring! I highly reccomend it! I'd love to know what is he doing now and is he still writing and speaking of the book 
 "The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam, but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she still moved like a shadow on the sea."  So begins Peter Beagle's, The Last Unicorn. What a fantastic book! This one has been on my to be read list for a long while.  The Last Unicorn is everything that a fantasy should be. It has unicorns to begin with, magicians, gypsies, old kingdoms, kings, princes, magic, an old castle on top of a hill, and a giant red bull.  It is the story of a unicorn who is on a quest to find others like herself. Along the way, she meets a magician and a gypsy sort of woman. They are on a quest to find The Red Bull who must be defeated in order for her to find the other unicorns. Plenty of magic, fighting, wizardry, love and loss occur along the way, all in breathtaking fashion.  The unicorn is a wonderful, powerful character. Unicorns are one of the first things that pop into my mind when I think of fantasy. Even white horses look magical in real life because of the idea of a unicorn. Peter Beagle's unicorn is the definition of what a unicorn should be. She's mysterious, powerful, beautiful, glowing, and magical. She reminded me a lot of Yvaine from Stardust even though Yvaine wasn't a unicorn. Read the book and you'll understand why. I thought of Stardust a lot while reading this book. It has the same magical theme, and is a classic fantastic fairy tale like Stardust is. In fact, I'm hoping that there's one scene involving a unicorn in Stardust that does not make it to the film because it was very upsetting just reading it.  The red bull was a wonderful character in The Last Unicorn. He is described as an enormous red bull who's size is more than one can imagine with horns like lightning and a sort of electricity coming off of him. He is also blind. He herds unicorns into the sea. Wonderful fantasy character and even though he's somewhat of a villain I still loved him.  The illustrations are done by Mel Grant and I loved them. They were exactly what they should be and I can't describe them much better than that. Black and white illustrations with a very "sketched" look that fit perfectly with the story.  This was my first book of Peter Beagle's. The man is an extraordinary writer. His descriptions are so detailed and beautiful and so different from any other authors I've read. He has a wonderful way with words and creates a beautiful story here. The next issue of Orson Scott Card's online magazine Intergalactic Medicine Show is supposed to have an interview with him and a new short story by him. Can't wait for that.  There's also an animated version of The Last Unicorn out there that I'd like to check out. It's always good to see a book translated into a movie and I believe that Peter Beagle wrote the screenplay for the movie. 
 Mike Binder wrote, directed and is a suport actor in this fun movie about anger. It stars Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. The entire ensemble cast of this movie were great in making this movie flow.  The movie follows the journey of a wife and mother whose husband unexpectedly disappears and leaves them alone. Now the family has to learn to deal with the anger of his not being there. The family has four daughters and they need to juggle their mom's romantic dilemmas and family dynamics that continually change. Kevin Costner plays a former baseball player, now radio DJ, who starts to fall for the family.  The true story of the movie is about anger. How it can stop and change your life if you let it. And even though the female lead is angry, she is dealing with a tough time in her life. But most of all the movie shows that anger is a waste of time and that you should not make assumptions. Always check your facts first 
 An excellent technical manual, or guide for someone desiring to set up a small commercial winery, but not for the beginner or aspiring home wine maker. There are several other books available on the topic of home wine making which cover the basics and have excellent recipes to get started. This book does cover the complete gamut of wine making from grape varieties, their attributes, and how they are grown, to the fermenting, all of the equipment and chemicals used in commercial wine making, aging, bottling, and storage. 
 I received the sweatpants quickly, and they were a little nicer than I expected 
 First, let it be said that I am not American, but European (Belgian in fact) and that I never lived in the US, but visited places like Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York and California and already read many books on American history before this one. But " Albion's seed" was a revelation to me. This book:   1)	Is fascinating in all that it teaches us about 17th and 18th century Anglo-American "popular culture", i.e. how people thought and led their spiritual, social and material lives, as well as the roots of this culture in the Middle Ages. 2)	Answered all of my basic questions on the continuity between America and its English past. 3)	Throws a very interesting light on American history and culture up to this day.  The argument developed in "Albion's seed" is that American culture is based on four strands of English regional cultures that pursued a life of their own once they found a home across the Atlantic.  It is also that their interactions explain most major events of US history since the revolution. These cultures are still very much alive in the United States, according to David Hackett Fischer, although they did not remain static and were nourished by the subsequent waves of migration from Europe and elsewhere.  The coexistence of those four cultures explains the main regional differences in the US including voting patterns in presidential elections.  The developments from 1776 to 1989 (publication date of "Albion's seed") are the subject of the last 100 pages of this huge book. But the first 800 are devoted to present one by one, these very important " four British folkways" in all their aspects, with an immense wealth of detail.   The main themes developed by the author are as follows:  a) First of all the four migrations were regional both in their origin and destinations: 1)	East Anglia to Massachusetts 2)	Southwest England to Virginia 3)	The English North Midlands to Pennsylvania 4)	The English-Scottish border area to the Appalachia and the Southern Backcountry   b) The movements happened at different times. The first two occurred before 1688 and the last two after that date, up to the 1770's. They were each the product of periods of economic, political or religious troubles in England that convinced their "victims" to leave the Mother Country in large numbers and seek  a better life elsewhere.   c) Their religion and social origins were also very distinct.  A propertied Puritan middle class from East Anglia settled in Massachusetts to escape the poor and the Nobility. Anglican second sons of the Gentry went from Southwest England to Virginia and recreated large estates to be worked by a proletarian underclass (who, because of the climate, they imported mostly from Africa). Northern Quaker Artisans and Shopkeepers tried to create an egalitarian utopia in Pennsylvania and Delaware. The poor border farmers, who moved to the Backcountry, professed an evangelical religion and were simply looking to escape starvation.  d) As a consequence of a, b and c, these people carried with them whole sets of very distinct social values that reflected their origins. They spoke different dialects of English and had their own views on all aspects of life, i.e. local political institutions, ideals of liberty, hierarchy, work, marriage, gender relations, child naming and raising, ways to structure and exploit the land, build houses, cook, clothe, practice sports, etc. David Hackett Fischer has managed to find compelling historical evidence that all these values were all very characteristic of immigrants' regions of origins. And today, now that, according to US census statistics, less than 20% of Americans have any English ancestry at all, it is precisely those social values that are the more lasting legacy of the first migrants to America. They make Americans in a very real sense "children" of 17th and 18th century England.            
 From start to finish this book is packed with useful, informative and best of all, unintimidating tools that are extremely helpful.  This book offers insight into the distorted thoughts that accompany eating disorders. By understanding what is going on in your mind, you can learn to change the way you see both yourself and the effects of your eating disorder.  I highly recommend this book to anyone suffering with an eating disorder or to anyone who knows someone who is. Reading this book truly changed my life, and for the first time in four years I am actually living a healthy and fufilling lifestyle 
 The world of pulp fiction graphics is extensive: there are examples numbering in the millions. In Pulp Culture, the authors have selected the finest examples from the era of pulp magazines and publications, presenting the most beautiful of cover art and accompanying these large-size reproductions and full-page spreads with a running history of pulp publishing. The result promises wide appeal to not only graphic artists and fans of pulp publishing but general-interest readers 
 I like this book!  It contains good basic information that a new speaker needs to know and an experienced speaker needs to re-think about from time to time.  I found the way it was written appealing; the author presents information to be a great speaker and uses messages from superstars 
 I was dubious when a friend passed this novel on to me.  Tom Clancy's "Op Center" series was a big disappointment, and I figured that the "Covert One" series would be the same - an effort to sell inferior novels written by second rate authors by cashing in on a "big name" author on the cover who probably did no more than provide an outline and possibly some technical advice to the writer who actually did the grunt work. What a surprise - I was hooked from page one and the action never let up.  In fact, I was motivated to order the rest of the "Covert One" books after finishing this one.  Hopefully, the rest of them will live up to the standard of "The Moscow Vector".  
 I did not think they could top last year's edition, but this is truly the best atlas on the market.  I am going to use it this weekend on a weekend family vacation 
 You really get a full band feel throughout most of this album and they add horns to many of the tracks as well.  The only problem with this album is that it is their longest and features the most amount of songs that are longer than their trademark of under 3 minutes, even 2 minutes.  There are a number of songs on here that are longer than 4 and some that just feel longer.  AT a certain point it just feels as if the album has stayed past its welcome.  I'm not sure if it does.  I like this album because it shows the influence of grunge on a few tracks while also staying true to the stylistic flipping from song to song that they are known for.  You might not make it through the entire album in one sitting, but it's still high quality 
 Now I know some will be in a rage with what I'll say but this is when RADIOHEAD were at their best. This includes Pablo Honey and The Bends material along with some other odds and ends. It is so mind blowing guitar driven it will give you chills and then Thom York's wonderful vocals will captivate you totally and completely. I honestly believe as they progressed after The Bends, their material became totally unlistenable. There's some amazing stuff post Bends but that is their Sgt. Pepper in my opinion. They definitely chilled out after The Bends. The one downfall of this DVD is that it's only in PCM stereo. That's really stupid but does sound great. I have no clue why they couldn't spring for 2.0 at a minimum but it's so damn awesome. 
 Jessica just came and spoke at my school. She was so nice, so approachable, so real! I just found out about this book and read it in one night!!!!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't put it down!  Now my entire group of friends are reading it and passing it around. Every girl can relate to Jessica's story of survival. I loved this book!!!!!!!!!! 
 Spoken in Darkness is the book The Dead Girl wanted to be.  It is more a memoir about growing up in a town that doesn't care and beginning to question why it doesn't care, than about the actual incident. Imbrie asks how her and her friend's lives ended up so different...and why she didn't know about the darkness in her friend's life...how they lost touch...and how her friend slipped away. At the end, Imbrie asks how this world can hold such evil as the animal that took out his hatred on her friend that slipped through the cracks in our fragile world so long ago.  Every woman knows that the line between a safe, protected life and being lost in a dark basement forever is thin.  Very thin.  Every woman knows that our safetey depends on the caring of each other.  This is what this book is about.  The Dead Girl has some passages I underlined about safety, but Spoken In Darkness is elegaic.  Neither book is really about the victim or the perpetrator.  Both are about why we care and look out for each other ... or lose sight of each other , let go of eather other's hand, in our dark, dangerous worl 
 great read...hard to put down. lots of interesting, and make-sense information. highly recommend 
 The Waste Lands, the third novel in Stephen King's The Dark Tower series is by far the best volume yet.  This volume picks up a short time after the end of Drawing of the Three, and we see Roland training Eddie and Susannah to become true gunslingers in Roland's world.  Soon into the novel, the three gunslingers encounter one the Guardians of Mid-World, a huge cyborg bear, who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds.  Roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the Dark Tower by a beam, and if they follow the beam, it will lead them directly to the Dark Tower, they just don't know how far away it is.  As the three gunslingers start to follow the beam, we, the readers, are taken to our own world and reintroduced to Jake, the ill-fated child from The Gunslinger.  Jake is currently having a mental breakdown (as is Roland) due to the fact that Roland saved him from dying his destined death at the hands of a Cadillac in The Drawing of the Three.  One part of Jake tells him he should be dead, the other says he should be alive.  Jake's mental breakdown leads him on a journey across New York to a haunted house that has many connections with other characters in the book, and in this house, Jake believes he can get back to Mid-World and be reunited with Roland.  The final part of the journey in The Waste Lands, takes our group to a city called Lud, on the outskirts of the waste lands.  The group believes they need to find a monorail named Blaine in the city, and he will help them on their journey to the Dark Tower.  Once they enter the city, much goes wrong and we are introduced to a really cool, but really evil character called the Tick-Tock Man, who runs Lud.  All of this leads up to a ridiculously exciting conclusion and a killer cliffhanger that makes me really glad I waited to read these until they were all published.  As far as action and suspense goes, The Waste Lands takes the cake easily from the previous two books.  Most of all, this book makes us appreciate the character development from the previous books.  We care so much about these characters, and would be devastated if anything were to happen to them.  This book also goes a long way in providing some much needed answers about the Dark Tower in general and Mid-World.  These answers are both satisfying and frustrating.  They are satisfying that you aren't completely clueless as to what is going on, but there are deeper answers to everything that we are given in this novel, so it just makes you want to read on more.  The series just keeps getting better as it goes along 
 Ought to be required reading for anyone building or remodeling their home.  I used the guidelines for building our 5000 sq. ft home in Southern California; infact, I made my architect read it too.  We have eight children, and our home gets just as dirty as anyone else's but it doesn't  show thanks to Aslett's good sense recommendations 
 this book is all about making life so much easier. the best thing is Cindy Glovinsky tells you to only take up what is suitable for you,and not force you to adapt to a complete impossible lifestyle.  I find this book very helpful! 
 I read this book and simply couldn't put it down! I bought 8 copies of it to give to family and friends as gifts. I'll never look at a Coca-Cola product the same way again. From a business or historical perspective, this  is a great read 
 This series of books is beyond words. For those looking for something like The Lord of the Rings, this is it. The only difference is that there is nothing that you can call puny in these books.   I have struggled to accurately display the story of Roland Deschain, son of steven, last gunslinger of gilead and his dark tower, yet I know of no diction to properly describe it. The closest I can come is to comparing it to a cross between a western (the gunslinger), The Lord of the Rings (magic, and other worldly happenings), and Band of Brothers (weapons, battles, bonding to the point of family). To me, it is the best literary work that ive laid eyes on. I will read this set of books till I have to breath left to spin.   
 Not since the Beatles reissues has a remastering provided such a dramatic improvement.  Although it doesn't say so, I'd suspect engineer Greg Calbi (who mastered the original album) went back to the original 24-track masters, meticulously cleaned up each individual track, then recombined them digitally for maximum clarity.  These don't sound like no safety masters!  Vocals, synth lines, percussion and bass all stand out in fresh relief.  Comparing this issue to the 1990 Sire CD (or even the 1980 LP) is like the Claritin ad, lifting a haze you didn't even know was there.  The track layout follows the 1981 re-issue, which replaced the track "Qu'ran" with the single B-side "Very Very Hungry" after the Islamic Council of Great Britain complained.  Interesting that 25 years later (in these days of Danish cartoons) we still can't afford to offend.  The seven bonus tracks are mostly familiar.  "Pitch to Voltage" is called "On The Road to Zagora" on the widely-circulated bootleg of outtakes "Ghosts," "Two Against Three" is "The Friends of Amos Tutola" and "Number 8 Mix" is "Les Hommes Ne Le Sauront Jamais."  "Defiant" is a radically remixed "Qu'ran" with a different vocal.  "New Feet" showed up on Eno's 1980 KPFA interview (as untitled).  "Vocal Outtakes" is 0:36 of exactly that and "Solo Guitar with Tin Foil" sounds like Byrne testing a long delay.  Still these tracks make a nice adjunct, and needless to say, sound WAY better than on the bootleg.  The only tracks missing are the real "Qu'ran" and "Into The Spirit World" ("The Jezebel Spirit" with the original Kathryn Kuhlman vocals, which her estate still refuses to license.)  I haven't mentioned the music yet.  Somehow, if you're reading this, I doubt I need to 
 Each time I pick up one of Patricia Sprinkle's stories about Mac Yarbrough, I am sure that she will not be able to top the last one.  However, each time I am pleasantly suprised with an even more complex mystery with extraordinary characters, all with convoluted reasons for being suspected of the crime or crimes. For me, it just doesn't get any better.  Having been born and raised in the south, these characters recall people I remember from my long-ago childhood.   Mac is a fictional character with whom I am sure I could be friends.  I can picture friendly visits and lengthy conversations about things interesting to both of us.   The method of her reasoning and the teasing out of obscure information about the other characters keeps me guessing until the end of the book.  The "reveal" in this book is presented in a manner that is every bit as good as any final act in a thrilling play.  The scene has been set and that description has been written so well I can picture it all in my mind. I can't imagine that anyone would be disappointed with this mystery.  The rich descriptions of the characters, their motives and actions (sometimes irrational, just as in real life) and the ultimate solution by a very real and interesting protagonist, are all reasons to read this book 
 A great collection of the recipes that gave French cuisine its international fame is awaiting you in this book. Don't allow yourself to be intimidated by the excellent pictures, and try some of these traditional  dishes. The vast majority of the ingredients can be found in the United  States. Just make sure you take your time to enjoy this wonderful food, as  the French take theirs to make meal taking an amazing experience 
 I am the co-owner of  a  growing software supply company. As you may have guessed, my business does not leave much time for  private time, much less time for spirtual reflection.  However, I attended a business conference  and was recommmended this book.  I can not stress enough how helpful it has  been.  My life feels fufilled - it is now "connected." I no  longer feel as if  I am leading two lives: one at the office,and one at  home.  I would recommend The Congruent Life to anyone who feels that their  business leaves them cold 
 As a non-scientist but a person very interested in science and how it changes our world and the people in it, I really enjoyed this book. The real science is there, with very lucid explanations for some seriously complex matters, but I think Mr. Guillen did a wonderful job of personalizing the scientists who made these great breakthroughs. Since we can assume that he did not get to personally speak with Newton and the others about their lives and the people in them, I thought he did a great job of making them seem real and so very human. Many of us assume that scientists are nothing but cold and logical in all aspects of their lives, and I think some scientists like to make us think that. (Somehow puts them a little above reproach). But the personal side to these stories is, I think, even more fascinating in a way than the science. The things that some of these people overcame are unbelievable. An excellent,fascinating and thoroughly interesting book 
 As far as the film goes, the finest ever. But without a doubt the opening helicopter shot is the best in any film. So amazing to see that helicopter descend upon Julie twirling it just makes my heart leap everytime I see it. The story we've all heard her tell about the downdraft from the copter endlessly leveling her until they got the shot always comes to mind when I see it. Never again will a film be produced that has the majesty and scope of this picture. It has it all. Period 
 Gungrave is an drama/fantasy anime set around the 1960's. Harry McDowell and Brandon Heat were just two young street punks, who stole things and fought other street gangs to survive in their turfs. Harry and Brandon, grew up in a orphange and have been best friends ever since. They were willing to do whatever it took to rise to the top and achieve freedom from their life of poverty and danger. Their chance came up when they met a top member of the most powerful mafia called, Millenion. Harry and his best friend Brandon, start off as errand boys, doing petty jobs inside the Millenion organization, but you'll see as they climb up the ladder and become, the mafia's top executives. You'll see as their ambitions and greed take over their actions for better or worse.   Gungrave is really an excellent anime all around. Even though its roots are based on a Playstation videogame, this anime is better than the game itself and should not be overlooked because you may have not enjoyed the videogame. The story theme about friendship, love, greed and betrayal is well scripted and feels similar to the, "Godfather" crime epic. Gungrave adds a supernatural twist by having undead creatures in the action. However, most of the story is told in a realistic fashion only dealing with the people drama. I enjoyed the epic feel of the story and became attached to many of the interesting characters, who were criminals by society's standards, but had a great sense of loyalty for each other. This is one of those anime series which contains a slow but engaging story. The production values are high; the animation is fluid, the artwork, character design, are excellent, the music is moody and the sound effects are loud. Both the English and Japanese voice acting are excellent and fit their characters well. There is graphic violence and profanity, so for adults only. I also recommend the anime called, "Hellsing".     
 Dear Sir or Madam:       I am writing to you to inform you of my response to my shipment from the above seller. I am very Impressed with the seller and I want to give him a THUMBS UP. 
 The Carina bra by Le Mystere is an excellent bra with smooth cups.  It does not show under clothing.  This particular bra defines each breast separately and the cups gently mold to each breast.  The straps are fairly narrow and are cut in a "rick-rack" fashion.  They can be adjusted by moving the back hooks closer in or further out.  The one disadvantage this bra has is that when putting it on, the straps sometimes come out of the slot where they are hooked.  You sometimes have to readjust them 2-3 times when putting it on.  Once on, this bra will certainly define you and give you a nice shape and uplifted bosom.  In fact, you could think of it as your bosom's buddy.  An excellent bra 
 It's what I expected.  All their hits, plus a couple more.  The additions were a little off the wall of my normal Green Day likes, but all-in-all it's a good CD 
 As a commercial grower and as a collector, I eagerly awaited the publication of this book. The book does not contain passages on every Cattleya out there, but for the species selected as "Classic" it is an invaluable resource. I also appreciated that Chadwick did not bow down to what I consider to be the over burdensome and ill conceived new classification system. Chadwick articles are frequently featured in the American Orchid Society magazine and I would consider him one of the foremost authorities on the subject. This book is very readable for the everyday collector and does not get overly involved in hyper-technical scientific jargon. Plus, the photography is beautiful. Anyone who enjoys orchids, or is interested in their history, would love this book.  
 Having watched the movie on numerous occasions I thought that it would be pertinent to read it. I dare say, that this was a splendid and brilliant experience. L. Frank Baum has managed to create an astounding fantasy world that includes the tinman, the strawman and the lion all which are looking for attributes that they sorely lack in their lives. The discriptors used and the verbage are nothing short of amazing and I love every single page of this great and fascinating story. I highly recommend it 
 Every day, veterans of the Vietnam War commit suicide in deep depression.  With the United States almost continually cutting its Veterans Administration budget, you would think that the V.A. would give up, but  books like those of Beck help it treat and cure depression and anxiety.   The Cognitive Therapy uses Socratic questioning, training people to ask why  they feel sad or anxious, what their answers mean, to substitute more  effective coping thoughts for ineffective thoughts and wrong ideas  (illogical ideas, like "everybody is against me," "I'm born  to fail," etc.).  Patients record in diaries or logs what events  trigger these wrong thoughts and learn to instantly respond with other  thoughts and actions.  This is one of the greatest books in psychology and  psychiatry, and should be read by the young people of all ages (many of  whom are depressed) as well as the older ones 
 I found this book to be quite interesting but not at all what I had anticipated.  Based on the title, I expected to see an erudite tome analyzing the lives of Ronald Reagan and Winston Churchill culminating in a discussion of how great leaders, such as these, are "made."  I was, of course, being rather naïve, for if anyone knew how great leaders are produced they wouldn't be so rare in human history.  What I found, instead, was a side-by-side comparison of two great men with emphasis on the parallels in their careers; the manner in which they were viewed by their contemporaries and the media in their own times; their visionary natures; the constancy of their actions; and the many connections between them which can be drawn when their characters, actions, writings, speeches, and strangely enough their educations are closely examined.    This latter point, their educations, may have come the closest to telling us how great leaders are created.  Both men, it would seem, were rather poor students in their early years, but both men spent most of the remainder of their lifetimes reading and writing and, in effect, educating themselves without any presumed experts to tell them that this or that theory or manner of thinking was incorrect.  In their solitude, much like Abraham Lincoln, they were left to decide for themselves what was right and what was wrong.   As a consequence, neither Reagan nor Churchill ended up conforming to the conventional wisdom of his time, with the result that neither one was fully understood nor appreciated during his political lifetime.    This is an excellent book filled with little known, or at least little remembered, facts, anecdotes, quotes, and excerpts concerning two great statesmen.  The comparisons are many, with surprising similarities that do both men great honor.  Bottom line - This is a book well worth reading.  I highly recommend it, but don't expect what the title offers but the book fails to deliver. 
    I got Harleys' "Complete Guide to High End Audio" before the "Intro Guide to High Perform..." although I ordered the "Intro" first. Wasn't to arrive for a couple of months so I couldn't wait to find things out & got the earlier "Complete..." Confused? Well, anyway this newest is basically a condensed version of the 'Complete". So if you have it you really don't need this. If not this work is going to get you all the high points and teachings of the other. Either way one or the other will get you started understanding the complexities of sound. Very useful & helpful info 
 Jeremy Irons has an affair with his son's fiancee Juliette Binoche, and becomes obsessed with her. Great erotic scenes, though not a lot of skin is shown, follow his obsession which leads to their affair being discovered, then tragedy.  The ending sees Irons' character as withdrawn and alienated from everyone, wondering: was it worth it?  
 As a medical journalist I am always on the lookout for great sources of sound, health information I can pass along to my readers. When I found this book - which was actually quite by accident - I knew I struck gold! It covers the most common (and not so common) skin conditions - which include not only things like wrinkles and fine lines, but also rashes and infections and some very serious problems. This is a reference book every woman should have, particularly mothers - kids get all kinds of skin problems growing up and what you will read in this book could be a real help.  Unlike the other reviewers I did not find this book commerical at all, but instead helpful and insightful.  Pick it up - it will be money well spent!

 This book offers a study of the strategic options for high tech firms. The coverage is wide and detailed. This is a great book. 
 Okay, let me start off by mentioning that this book is worth of a few hours of yours. Turn off your TV/laptop/what have you and read it. Sartre's existentialism is best expressed in his fictions including this one in my opinion. His persuation to nothingness is not quite expressible without phenomenological settings. And here they are. I'm having hard time to interest myself by reading Being and Nothingness, but this book is fun to read and easier to capture what he means to get at, although i still don't know what's his existentialism is all about (i, too, can quote his famous sayings, and that's besides the point). For those of whom not interested in Philosophy, this book still is worth reading. It's a well written book which isn't spoiled by the translation. If it doesn't bring us Sarte's original intention, the translator was as brilliant as the author. So read it 
 Sure, this album has been out a long time, and it may even seem dated if you weren't born when it came out.  But it's so damn good. I hadn't heard it in more than 10 years and just wanted to check it out again, to see if it really was as good as i remember.  The short answer:  you damn straight it's good.  It's freaky-deaky! Heavy and soft, loud and quiet, chocolate and kiwis. Go get it 
 I will never understand why Ayn Rand has always been snubbed by other philosophers. Most philosophers, if asked, will flat out deny that Rand was even a real philosopher. To me this is absurd. She has been called a hypocrite and even a cult leader, but such base ad hominem attacks of course have no bearing on the veracity of her claims. The Virtue of Selfishness is, in my opinion, the best of her publications. The title essay contains one of the most eye-openning and profound arguments I have ever read, which is this: Many people want to believe in immortality. In fact, most Americans DO believe that they are immortal, that death is really just a metamorphasis, that you carry on in another form, etc. If this were actually true, then morality would be of little importance. If we really did live forever then little to nothing could count for or against us. If nothing could count against us then we would have no values. If we had no values we would have no goals. And if we had no values or goals, morality would be irrelevant. Think about it. It's the very fact that life is FINITE that gives it meaning. This is an important lesson--that the immortality that so many hope and pray for would actually be a curse, just as it is to mythical vampires. Also profound are the discussions on selfishness. Selfishness is not a bad thing. Everyone does everything he or she does for selfish reasons. Even if someone appears to be behaving altruistically it is only because doing so makes him feel good about himself. On a sidenote, Nathaniel Branden also has an excellent essay in which he explains typical "party" behavior. We might look at people who love to party and think "Gee, they are such carefree individuals. They must love life and love having fun." Actually, Branden makes clear, they are miserable. They only act that way because of their emptiness as people. They are trying to distract themselves from their deep unhappiness. They try to drown out their lack of self-contentment with alcohol or other drugs, and with loud music and rooms full of loud obnoxious people. It's all a grand self-medicating distraction from the underlying problems at hand, and afterward, when the party is over and they are left alone with their own thoughts again, they are miserable. All of it, the alcohol, drugs, partying, rooms full of dancing and whatnot, is not the creation of happiness, but is merely the orchestrated cessation of unhappiness. 
 Dark City is an inspired film. Rufus Sewell is always worth watching and delivers a thoroughly believable performance within the incredible world of Dark City. John Hurt is a good hard-boiled police detective with the proper degree of angst. The sets, the special effects, but above all the storyline keep one guessing and fascinated. A definite cult classic, which leaves lingering questions and a vague, but enticing disquiet in the viewer 
  Interesting, accesible and ultimately enlightening but inclined also to be dry in an "Idiot's guide" kind of way, this renders the topic a little lack lustre which for me detracts from the point of veiwing art and getting any kind of personal, emotional experience from it. Excellent for making art accesible nonetheless and demystifying the nonsense that art glitterarty types surround the topic in so needlessly and prentiontiously 
 Doris Kearns Goodwin is a marvelous writer. She combines real history and real people in a way that is non-judgmental, educational and very redable. All of her books are a MUST.  Rik Clark Cape Co 
 If you are a student of theology, Western history of almost any sort, church-state relations, sociology of religion, philosophy of religion, or are just a mad autodidact, you already have this book. All primary sources, and fascinating reading for any occasion. If it played a role in the formation of Western theology and political-ecclesiological development, it is in this small book.  There is information in this book you don't even know that you are missing, so look at it this way: church histories are necessary and very important, but wouldn't you like to read the same documents the historians are reading, and draw your own conclusions? An essential tool for professors, students, pastors, and educated Westerners of all stripes 
 This music is so beautiful. Its more impressive for me because I like the game Halo so much, but regardless of this the music is excellent.  Rock Anthem for Saving the World is excellent, brash and epic conjuring up memories of desperate battles from the game. Covenant Dance is possibly my most favourite, its really breath-taking, epic and touching with a strange alien-like synth overlaying most of the track.  If you like the game, it means you like the music. How couldnt you? Some of the best videogame music ever, some of the best music ever 
  As many have said, this book is not Austen's most celebrated, but the main character, Fanny Price, is one of her best. Austen is a champion of the disadvantaged female and in this story, much like Jane Eyre, Fanny, as a child, goes to live with another family and is kept from the enjoyments of others. Not to say she is misused or treated like a servant, but is prohibited from the enjoyments of her adopted familys' life. Because of her inferior birth she is no more than a bystander but, through the course of events, each of her immediate family and a few neighboring friends, come to value her each in their own way. Though not overtly accomplished like the ladies around her she is a self-made woman. It is frustrating to be the reader at times, knowing what is in Fanny's mind, especially of her desires. If she would but speak, react, defend herself we know she would be more noticed and would have more of a chance with those she wishes to love. What is interesting is why is doesn't make those choices. Her personal discipline and conscience are perhaps, at times, her biggest enemies. The only reason this novel fell short for me was it's ending. As per usual with Austen's heroines, they eventually get what the want, which really can be said for any of her characters. They all get their just deserts. For a character like Fanny, who we've been rooting for the entire time, who we want to succeed, who we want to have the man she's wanted all her life, and who has never been able to communicate her wants or desires to anyone the ending felt like an empty victory.  She is this sad, simple, smart, incredibly deserving woman and we can only expect that her lifetime of waiting will pay off. It does, but not as she deserves. Not to say she doesn't get exactly what she wants, but we don't get to see the experience, to share in the triumph with her. 
 I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, both in a size large. The pajamas fit nicely, but the robe was WAY too big! I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online. Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund, and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange. So, now I have to re-order the robe in a smaller size, and the price has gone up $7 since Valentine's Day. This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size, but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed.  MORAL: Order one size smaller than you think you need. 
 I can not wait to see this film. Looking at the trailers I was more than curious why songs from New Order and The Cure are being used to promote  a period piece. It sparked my interest since the images and the music seem to work so well in a 30 second preview on the small screen.My question has been answered, it happens that, that is the score for the film. The soundtrack is great for a rainy day or even a sunny day outside it evokes all kinds of emotion. I was plesantly surprised and understand why this music was incorporated in the film. Marie Antoniette was a teenage queen, rebellious and high spirited torn between love and monarch and in no way different than a regular teenage girl today. The music in this soundtrack can so well have been her music of that day like her story as real today ,making it enjoyable for todays eyes and ears. Note the second disc includes a dash of the classical, just sit back kick off your shoes drink some wine and snuggle

 Among the increasing number of books purporting to connect complexity to  business, this one shines. If an organization takes nothing more than an  understanding of co-evolution away from this book, they will be well  served. And there is a great deal more to be mined for those organizations  looking for ways to make innovation a way of life. A powerful and rigorous  approach in spite of its Eurocentric underpinnings. Sherman's connection to  the Santa Fe Institute combine with impressive business credentials and an  encyclopedic philosophical mind to create a deep resource for exploring an  exciting new way to think about business 
 I saw these guys last night at the Knitting Factory in NYC where they played most, if not all, of their new album.  All I can say is even though the songs sound amazing on the cd they're a million times funkier live.  Buy the cd.  Then see them live.  You're welcome 
 During the past two years, I have used three of the internal Microfilters in 2 to 2.5 gal tanks with Bettas. In these filters, the aquarium water is sifted up through the filter and then released over the top of the open canister producing a waterfalls effect. The flow of the filter can be adjusted on some models (and I recommend the adjustable types). The filter system keeps the water clear, produces a very gentle current, and the filters are simple to change. Although they are a little large for small tanks, I prefer these filters over several other systems I have tried primarily because of the gentle current produced -- something I believe is less stressful for Bettas. I have had no problems with this product.

 I have nothing profound to say about this book, simply that I am a college student and it has been my pleasure to read this collection of Nietzsche's works. It has given me insight that I would be afraid of living without, now that I've consumed the knowledge contained within. I not only recommend this book to anyone that likes to learn, I give it high priority.  Nietzsche (or should I say Kaufmann?) writes in a way that the pieces are not only useful but somewhat entertaining. Thus, it was a pleasure.  "Everything is false! Everything is permitted! 
 I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com. This book was very popular because I was able to resell the book without losing money. 
 I loved the first season and it just kept on getting better as it went on.  Second season was the same way it gets very intense.  I knew that they cancled the show but they cancled it at a very bad time.  They leave you hanging.  If I knew this before I bought it I probably would have still bought it because I still wanted to see what happend next 
 It usually isn't a good sign when a band tosses a project away and detours into releasing an album.   In the case of Kraftwerk, the bulk of the Techno pop project was nixed after several years of work - though it produced a great video for the original version of Tour de France - for the dance club mix-tape, Electric Cafe.  The album was released five years after the classic Computer World & Kraftwerk's revolution within the studio that made electronics an industry standard.  I split the music into two segments, with the strongest by far Boing Boom Tschak, Techno Pop and Musique Non Stop. Though the final three cuts are interesting - The Telephone Call, Sex Object and Electric Cafe - they show a little strain in the band's cutting-edge creativity.  When released, the album was met with mostly critical reviews from fans and reviewers. But the sound surprisingly holds up well and, though not as adventurous as Computer World, it shows Kraftwerk pulsating to the rhythms of the dance floor they created years before.  
 I found this to be a great overview of the history of philosophy.  Although the storyline probably did help maintain my interest, this is not a great novel by any means.  As a book on philosphy, it is probably not for someone who is already well versed in the subject.  But for your average college level reader, and probably for an above average teen, this is a great introduction to philosphy.   
 This is a really fun DVD and Neon is a great teacher. Only I think it is not for an absolute beginner, some previous experience would help before you get to work with this one. If I had not done Amira's Bellydance 101  before, I would have being a little frustrated with this. Other than that it is a nice DVD to have 
 I can't remember the exact year, but this book has a copyright date in the 1040's!  My son's daycare center had the book and told me how much he loved it, so I ordered one for home.  It is his favorite book.  When we sit down each day to read it, we don't just read it once,we read it several times.  The story is simple enough that at 20 months old he knows the story and reads along on a couple of the words "up" and "water" as they are repeated throughout the story.  I would highly recommend it 
 . This CD is definately one of my Holiday favorites - right up there with a warm fire and eggnog! From the first time you hear it, Leon's engaging confidant delivery makes every one of these songs sound like a Christmas classic you've known all your life. When friends are over for the Holidays and this CD comes on they always smile and ask who it is - a collection to be comfortably enjoyed by all, a true Holiday Delight 
 I defer to E.J. Raven who told it like it is!!!  
 In this movie, Jack Nicholson's character faces a whole slew of stressful situations at once: his retirement, his wife's death, and his daughter's engagement to a guy he doesn't like.  As he faces all of these changes and situations, we hear his narration through letters he writes to an african boy he's sponsoring through one of those Compassion International type organizations.  The movie is dark, humorous, and deeply meaningful in the end.  I think that, in a way, we are all like Schmidt, searching for meaning in our lives through a variety of means, not knowing where it will come from, facing discouragement, and finding hope 
 There is an advantage to reading a book a few years after it is first published.  The advantage in this case is that the Saddam dictatorship is history and many of the assurances that lead us to war have been proven to be a little over hyped, to be generous.  That comment leads us to this book.  The author was the head of the UN weapons inspectors in the last two years they were in place, ending in 1998.  This book is his review of his time on the job and the obligatory musings about what needed to be done with Saddam circa 2000.  I had heard in a number of other articles and some books that the author was a bit arrogant and pushy.  To be fair, those personality traits, if they even exist, did not come out in the book.  The author presented his case in a rather fair sounding and well thought out process.  There were no over the top dramatics nor did it seam to me that the author was trying to stretch the truth to prove his point.  I  started this book thinking it would be one case after another of how Iraq had hid WMD`s, yet they were hardly ever mentioned.   By this I mean that the author only detailed out a few cases of papers being found and old weapons parts being dug up.  In all his pages on the inspection process, the author gives the reader no finds of the actual weapons the world was looking for.  All the author really detailed was the unlimited number of ways the Iraqi's found to be unhelpful, arrogant, and just plain nasty to his team. If there ever was a case for how not to play well with others the Iraqi's are the hands down favorites.  In hind sight, what is rather humorous is that if they would have just swallowed a little crow and let the UN run all over their county unmolested for a few years, they would have left and the Saddam cronies would still be in power.  This could be the first dictator to loss power due to unending amounts of arrogance coupled with a good helping of plain ignorance.  The last item I found interesting was the side story that bordered on a male cat fight.  This author and Scott Ritter, another of the weapons inspectors, had a few words while working together and both decided to finish the disagreement in the press.  About the only value in the comments is that it makes you smile a little to think that this author lowered himself to grade school play ground name calling in a book for the masses.  Overall, I found the book interesting in its detail of the way the Iraqi government dealt with the UN and how the French, Russians and Chinese all interacted with the US.  I also thought the very apparent lack of evidence of WMD`s being discussed in the book was a precursor of things to come.   If you are interested in the conservative thinking that lead up to the Iraqi war, then this book is an interesting bit a the picture.  
 David Hockney is an artist whose works are familiar to everyone, whether from exposure to his many museum shows, his paintings and drawings included in every major survey of contemporary art, to his magical sets for operas such as The Magic Flute, Die Frau Ohne Schatten, The Rake's Progress, Tristan und Isolde, etc.  This current book DAVID HOCKNEY PORTRAITS is, for this reader, the most sensitive presentation of Hockney not only as an artist but also as a tender, feeling, caring human being.  The book accompanies an exhibition soon to travel and includes over 250 examples of Hockney's view of his family, himself, his friends - famous and not so famous-, lovers, and pets.  The result is a survey of Hockney's people-oriented works over the past fifty years.  Included are early pen and ink drawings from the 1950s, gentle and simple line portraits of his mother and father and himself, and progresses to the development of his large-scale paintings of life size portraits of family, lovers, and self-portraits.  Many of the people depicted in these works are no longer alive and there is a sense of memory in some of the works that barely hides Hockney's sadness at their parting.  The book also opens the door to Hockney's experimentation with photography as an art medium, with several of his multiple view Polaroid collages of a single 'sitting' telling more stories than a movie.  And after Hockney's excursion into that medium the portraits turn to painting his subjects from life.    Most of the works in this book have been published in other volumes or have become familiar to the public by other means, but it is the curatorial hand that makes his survey so fine and so immediate, a success not easily accomplished with an artist as private as Hockney: the collection is under the encouraging guidance of the artist.  This is an excellent overview of a very special artist whose works continue to capture the imagination of viewers and fellow artists alike. Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, April 06   
 I have read all of Clavell's novels in the Asian Saga, and although Shogun, Noble House and King Rat are more influential, Whirlwind was my personal favorite.  The tale of a British helicopter company associated with the Noble House, with pilots of American, British, Canadian, Finnish, and Australian nationalities who become involuntarily immersed with the Iranian Revolution of 1979 is an incredible in-depth story.  Complex, with many stories within the story that slowly unravels in this 1100 page epic.  Clavell is able to write about the mysterious country of Iran in great detail, that to read the novel is a learning experience in itself.  Because so much is going on simultaneously, however, one can become lost in the complexity of the story.  Nevertheless, Clavell manages to weave the story together so that the novel concludes in an epic fashion, leaving the reader emotionally drained, yet satisfied.  Unfortunately, with Clavell's death, Whirlwind is not able to be expounded upon.  Clavell never was able to finish off his Asian Saga, and there are many loose ends in the book that you expect to be covered in future novels, but never will 
 I really enjoyed Wuthering Heights once I made it past the first 40 pages or so...that's when it really picked up. I think it was a nice story and well told. I don't want to give anything away, but it's a really good book and I definitely recommend it along with Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte 
 Generally, I avoid reading memoirs because I find them to be trite and distastefully emotional.  However, Fuller's Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, about the author's experience growing up white in Africa, pleasantly surprised me.  Simple and sincere, Fuller avoids judgment of herself and others as she relates her difficult life with neither sugar-coated poeticism nor the sensationalistic `woe-is-me' attitude one might expect.  She is truthful with herself and with the reader: she does not apologize for her family's racist attitudes, but neither does she justify them.  Likewise, Fuller's unconditional love for her mother underlies her necessarily harsh descriptions of her alcoholic mother's mental instability.  Remarkably, the book interweaves crucial social issues-such as racism and the effects of revolution on all facets of society-with universal, yet gently personal, themes of familial love, self-discovery, and a sense of belonging.  This candid portrait of an extraordinary girl's pains and joys is worth the read.  Thoroughly uplifting, it is fresh and full of life.  
 If you are looking for a heavy duty garment rack, this is it.  I purchased the first one to free up closet space and I just had to get a second one for guests.  I hosted a party and did not have to worry about the rack falling apart or tilting to one side.  Easy access for everyone coming and going.  When not in use it folds away nicely 
 I bought this book after catching the Chelsea Handler Show on E!  At first I was a bit disappointed because I thought her stand up was hysterical.  And then it occurred to me that I was actually laughing out loud while reading this book.  Nor could I put the book down.  It's a bit different than her stand up, but every bit as entertaining 
 Author Masaaki Imai argues that companies can become more profitable by constantly looking for efficiencies, instead of seeking huge leaps, as is the Western custom. The Japanese philosophy of kaizen says businesses must mercilessly cut waste by eliminating anything that's even remotely inefficient. These strategies will lead to more profitable companies and better employee morale. Imai makes compelling arguments, and supports them with a number of case studies and real world examples that show kaizen in action. We at getAbstract recommend this book to managers, particularly executives of manufacturing companies 
 Personally, I don't think I would resort to murder, but for the four brothers in this movie there was no doubt how far they would go. Set off by the police force's lack of effort (in their eyes) in finding their adoptive mother's killer, the four brothers take vigilante justice to a whole new level. Nearly lost in the plot of killing, corruption and revenge though is a story about family, loyalty and love, even respect (for the woman who raised them mostly). I was touched by their Thanksgiving meal where they each saw her, except Bobby, who finally saw her at the end. Josh Charles plays another smarmy, dirty cop (like he did in SWAT) and Garrett Hedlund does an amazing job as the troubled, youngest brother who tries so hard to make the older ones proud. A well done piece by Singleton for sure, it could have been set in any large city but he picked Detroit. Interesting. This movie is very gritty and violent, but I was drawn right in and everytime I thought I had it figured out there was another twist 
 After reading some of her latest books, i.e., Impossible, and being EXTREMELY disappointed, I reluctantly picked this one up, hoping for the good old Danielle Steel books that she used to write.  Thank goodness.  Malice is an excellent story.  Grace went through so much and yet held her head up.  From prison life to fighting off the creeps she would end up working with, she never lost sight of her goals and made it through.    Unlike the book, Impossible, I easily finished this to the end and enjoyed every page.  I just wish Ms. Steel would still write books like this one!!  I definitely recommend it! 
 As a student preparing for the SAT II Latin, I found that very few prep books had been written.  Then I found this one, and figured to try it, because anything was better than what I had.  I was very impressed with the book.  Every imaginable topic was covered, and it was split up well so that if you need to review only one thing, like cum clauses or indefinite pronouns, you can do it easily.  I recently took the exam, and I can say that the practice questions are almost identical; I even recall two questions on the exam being in this book.  The explanations of the answers make it easy to go back and find what you don't know. Only two problems with this book.  A few of the questions had the wrong answer, but the explanation was correct, so as long as you read it you can still learn.  Second, there was no raw to scaled conversion chart, so I could only get a general idea of how I had done.  Depsite these, this book is definetly worth it, especially with the other poor choices available. Update: I recently got my scores back, and I got a 740.  After realizing a stupid mistake that led to several wrong answers, I probably could have gottten an 800.  Definetly worth buying 
 I am 45 years old and perimenapause hit me like a ton of bricks last September.  After a lifetime of being a "happy go lucky", positive and upbeat person, I suddenly felt extremely anxious, depressed, had difficulty sleeping through the night, suffered from night sweats, migraines, and was basically an emotional wreck.  I felt like I was going crazy.  I still have monthly cycles, but they have become much milder.  Anyway, I went to see my doctor and he put me on anti-anxiety and sleep medication which made my condition much worse.  After talking to some friends about natural remedies, I decided to do some research and found Dr. Gittleman's book.  Just changing my diet alone (getting rid of the "bad carbs" and eating protien at every meal) made a tremendous difference in the way I felt.  I am taking the supplements and the oils, along with the progesterone cream and I am feeling more and more like my old self every day.  In response to the person who wrote about the diet not being enough to "feed a hamster", once your body adjusts to eating protien vs. bad carbs you find that you do not need more than what the Dr. recommends for serving sizes.  I cannot tell enough women in their 40's about this wonderful book!  It's at least worth a shot before taking hormone replacement 
 This is a well-produced and written sequel. It is faithful to the original production and to its literary roots in a concise form. I extremely enjoyed it and found it to be a good follow-up to the lives of the central characters from the original ANNE OF GREEN GABLES. The cast was very good and gave very credible and memorable performances. I was very impressed with Frank Converse, an actor I always liked and it was good to see him in a substantial role once again. Megan Follows is once again brilliant and very charismatic as Anne Shirley. The print is very good making the details of the sets and beautiful outdoor photography emerge quite stunning. I highly recommend this one.  
 How can you not love a novel that contains the above line of dialogue?  This is a staggering, intricate, hilarious work of fiction.  Even the incidentals (Red the fat horse, Navarro's conversation with Doc Schooner in Nelson Senior's house, Clarence driving in the dust storm, the whole Whitehorn episode near the end) are both funny and moving.  Me anyway, I was floored.  By the way, I came across the Bill Knott poem that gives this novel its plot and it is a source of wonder to me to  see how one gifted writer can both celebrate and extend the work of another.  Already Dead is a book for the ages 
 This well-written and easy-read of a book is a must for anyone who is even remotely interested in thestate of crime and criminal justice in America.  The book lays out the past, present and future of crime policy in easy to  understand prose. the book takes on all of the hard issues and addresses  them clearly and objectively. This book not only defines the issues, it  also lays out great ideas for solving some of the big problems in crime.  Enjoy 
 I would assume that anyone interested in buying this would have to have seen the movie. As this is not a typical soundtrack with artists on it that you would "have to have".  Saying that fist, any soundtrack that has Wesley Willis on it kicks some serious butt!  Maybe you remember the sceen where the kids are playing in the toys and you hear the very off key, casio keyboard based song with the lyrics "rock and roll mcdonalds, rock and roll mcdonalds. they serve quarter pounders with cheese, it will make you fat!" PRICELESS  My husband first introduced me to the sound stylings (seriously the best term for it) of Mr. Willis about two years ago. We would pass different resteraunts and he would sing those lines of music. I couldnt beleive my ears. Was this for real?? Oh yeah.   Perhaps worth the price of the cd is just that one song. But there is another standout on here "Rubber Bisquit" by The Chips.Origionally from the mid 1950's I heard this song on the "Crybaby" soundtrack. (a fine film I might add. a lip syncing Johnny Depp like you have never seen.) This song was however re-recorded by the Blues Brothers. That is if your old enough to know who they are.   
 As usual when it comes to Betty Crocker cook books all recipes come out great.  This book is no exception 
 This is a great book! It's definetly a MUST-READ for beinning climbers or climbing enthusiasts! I loved this book, even though it is not as well-written as some books are. It's easy reading. It's a great book 
 Read Lean Thinking before you read this book.  This applies the theories from Lean Thinking to the service industry environment.  The beginning of the book is somewhat wordy and boring, but it picks up when it goes into actual case analysis, such as Tesco or auto repair.  Very interesting theories on the next wave of business.  Read this with Blue Ocean Strategy 
 Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "A man is what he thinks about all day long..." We are...we really, really are. But the sad fact of the matter is, most of us do not really know what we are thinking. In fact, I would say that most of us aren't really thinking at all. Most of us are just operating on unconscious reactions to things.   Does this make your butt twitch? Does this make you a little nervous?  It should...but...don't get too nervous...don't go too much in a panic. If there is something from this review that I want you to remember the most, is this:   WHAT THOUGHT HAS DONE, THOUGHT CAN UNDO!!  Think about this for the next 25 years of your life. Meditate upon this powerful Truth. Who you are is simply the residual effect of what you have thought about in the past. This is is a new day! This is a new opportunity for you to turn EVERYTHING around! If you have been ill or sick, now is your time to claim health and wellness. If you have been experiencing lack or limitation, now is the accepted time to claim wealth and abundance. You see, the universe never holds anything back from you. Never! There is only a stream of well-being in the universe...you just need to come into alignment with it...and we do this with our thoughts...we do this with our feelings...we do this with the images we are holding in mind.  Think about only that which you desire to attract. Feel the feelings of how it would be to have those things you want to attract. Imagine having those things, those experiences, that beautiful, abundant, healthy, well-lived life now! And I guarantee that you will! It is always done unto you as you believe.  This book is incredibly inspirational and so well worth it. The book, however, won't change your life. Only you can do that. And I happen to believe that you can!  Know that this is your day. You are a blessing!  Peace & Blessings, dear reader.. 
 In this brilliant and thoroughly researched book, Caryn Cosse Bell manages to shed new light on the unique history of New Orleans' free people of color.  She answers the questions about how the gens de couleur libres were  able to develop into such a politically minded, intelligent, and powerful  force throughout Louisiana's history.  She dispells common myths often  attached to the Creoles of Color, such as their racism and marginality in  society.  Starting with the founding of New Orleans in 1718, she shows the  development of a strong, assertive class of people interested in full  equality for all people, regardless of race or color.  Their rights often  came under fire under the rule of the American government, but they  persevered.  The battles over Reconstruction are the climax of this  account, and she ends with the Creoles of Color's greatest victory--the  Reconstruction Constitution of Louisiana in 1868. This book was wonderful,  intelligent, and well researched.  It should be read by anyone interested  in Louisiana History, Black History, or American History 
 Investment banker Matthew Simmons presents a wealth of information on oil production, history, and exploration, in Saudi Arabia. He reviews the decades long history of oil production in this kingdom, giving minute detail on all of the major fields. All of these giant and super-giant oil fields were discovered many years ago, most of them decades ago, and  Simmons believes they are at their peak or past, due to their ages and history of overproduction. Problems with these fields that Simmons lists include drilling complicated by cracks and faults, gas caps, low reservoir pressures, and increasing water cuts. Simmons gets much of his data from the Society Of Petroleum Engineers, where about 200 of these papers, over the decades, discuss Saudi oil fields. These papers are very technical, although Simmons has a keen analytical mind and would have made a good geologist himself. You can learn a lot about the geology of oil by reading this book. As with anything in life proper evidence has to support what you believe, and these SPE papers do just that in this issue. After looking at these papers, and other evidence, Simmons concludes that Saudi oil production is not the miracle most of the world believes, and a plateau period or even a production collapse may be in order soon. Gas caps forming, higher water cuts, short well life, low reservoir pressures are all indicative of the impending failure, or end, of the very productive primary production phase and the start of the reduced production volumes of the secondary and teriary programs where perhaps thousands of wells will have to be drilled to support even a slowly falling production rate, as has taken place in the United States over the past few decades, in short...the beginning of depletion. Another topic Simmons brings up is the rapidly increasing population of Saudi Arabia and how this in itself could create problems and instability.    The Saudis themselves are entertaining if nothing else. A couple of years ago they were saying their oilfields could increase production to 15 million barrels per day and sustain that productions for about 50 years. Now they say they could sustain 15 mbd for 20 years. A big change, did anyone take notice? Even the 20 year figure, in all reality, is far in excess of what is possible but at least it is closer to the truth. According to Simmons even the current approximately 10 mbd is too much to sustain over the long term without irreparably damaging their fields and reducing the amount ultimately recoverable. The Saudis should go ahead and admit they are at or near their peak. This would increase oil prices to where they need to be to create REAL conservation efforts the world over, eliminating much waste and duplication, and stimulate the search and development, in earnest, of viable alternative energy sources. The largest oil field in the world is the aging supergiant Ghawar in Saudi Arabia, and there is a saying that goes something like this: As goes Ghawar so goes Saudi Arabia and so goes the world.   In the last few pages Simmons creates a somewhat optimistic tone that we can somehow muddle our way through this mess, with alternative energy, conservation, etc.. Well, perhaps we can, but at least we can also take personal choices such as paying off debt to help us in a more immediate sense. After reading this book I was left with the impression that a world peak in conventional oil production could be occurring now, or imminent, and the resultant fall after the peak could be sooner and more steep than most who have studied the problem realize.                             
 The CCNP BCMSN Exam Certification Guide is a great resource for CCNP recertification.  The material is not in-depth but informative enough for those that have taken a BCMSN exam before.  The accompanying CD-ROM with sample test questions is also very helpful.  With this book, along with the CCNP BSCI Exam Certification Guide and related Transcender practice exams, I was able to pass the CCNP Composite exam (642-891) and complete my CCNP recertification 
 I have not even gotten to watch the entire DVD yet and already I am very impressed.  Some the the insightful things Ms. Hahn says regarding her performances could (and should) be used for college, or even high school, speech classes.  But the music is what makes the DVD.  Any classical music fan, especially any fan of Hilary's, needs to buy this DVD 
 I wish I had a van. Vans are pretty cool. I mean...there's just so much room. And sure, they can't drag real well, but you don't drag in a van. You got subs, and room for gals. And if you're really classy you can get a couple of couches back there and a TV, and you can roll in it.  If I had a van I'd probably be playing this album in it. I kid you not, Stand By Your Van has been in my '04 Taurus' CD player for the last 5 months. That's staying power music isn't supposed to have.  There's something magical about this album. I think it has something to do with the band in general. Sublime was a real band. They were underproduced until their final album, and a lot of the stuff they recorded came straight out of their living room. The problem with that is that their earlier stuff had pretty crappy production. It felt like the music was on plastic. And a lot of their later songs, although good, sounded a bit overproduced.  Stand By Your Van is a perfect blend of good production with that authentic sound you can only get live. Bradley Nowell is drunk, the crowd is singing, a lot of the songs have improved parts. I think this is Sublime at their best. Particularly, the first 8 songs on the album - the flow is amazing, and the live sound tops each and every studio recording.  I'm not the biggest Sublime fan. But I can roll to this album anyday. If you want to hear Sublime, get this 
 This new translation of Analects provides us with a fresh view on Confucius' Way as it was, at least the authors claim so. It is correctly pointed out in the book that the task of reconstructing the "original" Confucius is inevitably interwined with our ever-changing understanding of the pre-Chin Chinese intellectual history. The task is never going to be easy, and is highly influenced by subjective preferences of individual researchers. The authors provide an updated theory of how the Analects was written in the course of several hundred years. One thing I like most is that convincing evidences are given to show that filial piety was NOT central in Confucius' morality. However, there are some other shaky arguments. For example, their effort of establishing this guy or that guy as the leader of the early Confucian disciples is too imaginative 
 This is a good book on knowledge management.  It provides an adequate historical reference and a succinct framework for the opportunities and incentives for KM but it is as of 2002.  This book needs updating.  It's not bad but is pre-wiki and web images are dated.  Buy used...don't spend $40.00 
 You know who you are.    The long-time fan of Clapton's, the person in the audience nowadays yelling "Go Slowhand!" as Eric  plays lick after passionless lick, the dude who wishes Eric would reunite with Cream for good.    If so, this is not for you.   Sorry.   If it's any consolation, I used to be one of you.   Somewhere down the line, my road forked off and, at the tender age of 20, here I am saying that this album is too subtle for most.   What is the world coming to?   What sense could I have?   Hear me out.  The genius behind these songs is not in the mindless soloing, or the screeching vocals.   In fact, the record has neither.   Rather, it's "There's One In Every Crowd"'s economy that gives it a five-star charm.   Most words are barely spoken over a whisper.   Most solos barely reach above the tenth fret.   And they barely last more than thirty seconds.   Instead, the album is full of melodic, moody guitar playing, and breathy even sexy singing.   And, God, what a band- they're guaranteed to hit the groove that will either make you melt or shiver by the time the last seconds of "Opposites" dissappear back to 1975.   That is, unless you're the guy mentioned above.   If you are, again, I'm sorry...your loss 
 I have to take a deep breath before I start this one. I adore Hamilton. I really do. But I am getting so sick and tired of Anita Blake having sex with everything that walks. On the other hand, at least this one seemed to actually follow most of the book description and didn't have a baddie of the moment that required some new power coming online for Anita to save the day.  I think I am quickly learning to hate Ronnie with a passion; her treatment of Anita in the beginning of the book was horrid for a best friend. I loved Nathaniel's reaction to Ronnie and his treatment of her. Nathaniel really started to grow in this book! And considering that he is one of the characters I adore I was happy to see him grow; he was showing a more dominant, more possessive side of himself.  I did like the new information about what Anita is and what she can do. I am continually fascinated by Hamilton's writing of how things work within Anita's world. Her power with the triumvirate she has with Jean-Claude and Richard is growing and she's learning more about how to be the pivot in her own triumvirate with Nathaniel (and how happy am I that he's her animal to call?!) and Damien.  I found the reactions of the men in her life interesting and telling. Richard's reaction to the baby news was... infuriating. Claudia called it right, he wants her barefoot and pregnant and if she's a mom then he can have the house with the white picket fence. That is so not Anita. She's not going to give up her life and her lovers, especially when two of those lovers appear to be the glue that holds her life together and at least one of them is part of her power. I was thrilled by Micah and Nathaniel's response to the pregnancy. I thought Nathaniel would be absolutely adorable taking care of a baby.  I'm honestly more interested in the characters in the books than I am in the plot a lot of times. That's why I think I'm okay with the books having so little of it; I like knowing about the characters and how their lives are going.  On the whole I was much happier with this book than I had been with previous ones. The ending didn't feel as rushed as it previous ones and I was happy that the entire book seemed to take more than just one 24 hour period to complete. (It might not have taken much more than 24 hours but it took at least some more! 
 I bought this product for my boyfriend who absolutely loves it! I've tried it before, it has a GREAT flavor, just like drinking chocolate milk! The shipping was quick too 
 Although many people think of George Romeros Night,Dawn and Day of the dead films, or Lucio Fulcis Zombi 2 when they hear the words "zombie film", lesser known exploits of the 70's and 80's are rarely discovered by knewcomers. These underated clasics are only put on dvd because of demand from hardcore fans of the genre. One of my favorite zombie films falls directly into this category, Burial Ground [also known as The Nights Of Terror] is a pure cheese film. The actors portraying the zombies are obviously wearing masks, but they look pretty cool. The acting is what you would expect from this kind of film, pretty bad. The special effects are a bit cheesy, but effective. The cheesyness of the the film only helps make it moor enjoyable. Luckilly the film is so unnintentially funny that you have a chance to relax before one of the hopeless victims has his/her intestines riped out. The film takes no time getting to the zombie scenes, although this means that a good storyline is pretty non existant. The zombies are quite intelligent and very menacing. They use weapons, work together to ram a door down and even impersonate monks to trick the main characters into a trap. I'm not saying that Burial Ground dosn't have its flaws [especially when it trys to recreate the eye splinter scene from Fulcis Zombi 2, failing horribly] but the film is so enjoyable that you'll just laugh and have fun with its stupidity, and then be smacked in the face with shocking carnage and zombie mayhem. A must own for hardcore horror fans. Get it now and enjoy.  
 Blue Note had a knack for discovering off-kilter piano players. First it was Monk who was initially ridiculed and sold badly but after a decade or so people began to understand that he really was something else and he is now (rightfully) considered one of the most important composers and improvisers in jazz ever. After that it was the underrated Herbie Nicols, who like Monk, initally suffered total public indifference. Nowadays however, Nichols is namechecked  by tons of musicians and an "underground" legend. Unfortunately, he never lived to see this. Last in this line was Andrew Hill. Frank Lion loved his work and let him record no less than 5 records in approximately 6 months. unfortunately they sold very bad and, with the exception of Point of Departure, has been mostly out of print in the latest 40 years. This, along with the fact that most of Hills later records have been on smaller european companies and in solo-settings, has meant that not many people have heard him. Now, however, Blue Note have no less than 4 of these masterpieces in print (the only one missing from this initial bunch of records is the somewhat weaker "Smokestack"). Hopefully this means that Hill will finally get the recognition he deserves. That he will have a new record out on Blue Note soon (featuring Charles Tolliver, another forgotten great!!!) doesn't make matters worse.  About this record, it doesn't have any horns on it which may turn some people off but the compositions are uniformly brilliant (arguably my favourite Hill record in terms of the written material)and the interplay between Hill, Hutcherson and the always wonderful Richard Davis is incredible. The added bonus is that the drummer on this record is Elvin Jones. Hill usually recorded with drummers like Roy Haynes, Joe Chambers and Tony Williams who all have a more quirky, "skittery" way of playing drums compared with Jones muscular and extroverted style. The contrast between Jones (who doesn't overplay at all, he sounds really sympathetic to the other musicians) and the others more introverted stylings gives this record a unique sound compared with Hills other records from this era. It arguably also makes the record more accessible for newcomers to Hills music which makes this a great introduction!! 
 When Once and Again first began I dismissed it as a show for just women. But after watching just one episode I found myself hooked. This was unlike any show I had seen before. I actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families. Once and Again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love. It goes much deeper than that. Once and Again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well. But then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well. With the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell) and how their ex's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children. Once and Again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today. Even thought it's time on television was short Once and Again showcased the acting talents of Sela Ward and Billy Campbell and launched the careers of Shane West and Evan Rachel Wood. I am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on DVD and that they have finally decided to release Seasons 2 and 3 
 I Love Tsunami Bomb. If you like this get their older cd 
 I bought the aqua fitness belt to wear while snorkeling.  Since I am not a strong swimmer, it helped me stay afloat so I could concentrate on seeing the beautiful fish and coral reef off the shores of Belize.  It worked beautifully and I am very pleased with my purchase. Delivery was prompt and I was able to track the progress of my purchase 
 I am not a "computer person" but found this to be easy, easy, easy 
 This book is interesting, and perhaps groundbreaking. Unlike the previous reviewer, however, I'm not sure I'd want to call this original feminist text "seminal. 
 Matilda is an extraordinary girl who has read most of the books in the library by age seven (including A Tale of Two Cities).  However, she is stuck with ignorant, mean parents who lie and cheat and who want her to watch television rather than waste time reading.  Through her teacher, Ms. Honey, Matilda discovers just how extraordinary she is and uses her new special powers to help Ms. Honey vanquish her ogre of an aunt, Ms. Trunchbull, and to outwit the witless parents in her own life.  One of Dahl's best along with James and the Giant Peach and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 
 This book includes playgyms of all sizes of birds and toys for all bird personalities (the buzzsaw, the cuddler, etc.).  It made toymaking and playgym building nearly painless!  The instructions clear and they even give you shopping checklists and estimated costs!!!!  I was able to make a HUGE playgym for my Military macaw for about $50 (not including toys) in a Saturday afternoon all by myself with just a chop saw and a rubber mallet (see my photos under customer photos).  Compare this to a small, wobbly PVC playgym that I paid $200 for and had to wait 6 weeks for delivery.  Oscar (our birdie) loved his gym so much that I made a smaller version for indoors so he doesn't have to be cage-bound when the weather is bad. After I made the first one, customizing is a breeze.  I work for a companion bird education/adoption organization and we recommend this to all of our members, but I didn't really appreciate it until I built something for myself 
 Everyone wants to succeed. But in a world where corporate CEOs carve out multimillion dollar contracts and Britney Spears is front-page news, society's view of success is entirely skewed. Authors and Harvard faculty members Laura Nash and Howard Stevenson take a hard look at idealized celebrity success and adopt a view that is the opposite of the popular attitude that promotes going for the maximum. Instead, they advocate learning how to be satisfied with "just enough." Through careful self-examination and structured fulfillment exercises, the authors explain how to obtain success in four main areas of your personal and professional life: happiness, achievement, satisfaction and legacy. Ironically, for a book titled `Just Enough,' it supplies way too much verbiage and analysis. But we find the topic timely and well researched. Those who are striving for balance and just the right amount of success will find this self-help book extremely useful, although those who deeply want it all may be tougher to dissuade 
 Very easy to understand.  The talking feature works very well.  We left ours in a cold car that was below the recommended temperature. The defib. voice instructed us how to get it functional again.  We are very pleased with the ease of operation 
 An absolutely wonderful book full of useful information.  The author has put together an easily read text with practical advice.  Not confusing like most feng shui books.  It is THE best beginner's book on this subject that  I have found.  Once you have assimilated the basics, then you can go on to  the more detailed tomes 
 I recommend this for Turntablists and up and coming DJ's. It never gets old and has an unforgetable, unique sound. I have the original copy with just the one disc, but I am sure that the second disc doesn't dissapoint. He is one of the illest! Peac 
 My husband designs roller coasters, and I wanted to get a book for our son who, someday, is going to be riding them!  (He's 7 weeks old today :)  This is a great book for kids who may be a little scared of roller coasters, and who need to know exactly what happens from waiting in line to getting back in line after the ride is over!  Easy read and great pictures 
 It takes spades of talent to create music as beautiful as this without the aid of layered mixing, over-hyped production and in Miles' case, even lyrics.  Even if you're not a big surf fan, but are looking for a rage-dump disc, this is it! If you happen to love surf to begin with, you will be pleasently surprised. Although, I do want to mention that this is not a full-blooded surf album. It is mainly sparkling reverb with occasional acoustic amid a tapestry of soft bongo-like percussion. No one plays as clean or precisely as Miles. His songwriting capabilities are the real treat here though. Haunting, dramatic but always relaxing, it dosen't get more mellow or exotic than this 
 It was during the hype of this reunion album that I got into Deep Purple. I watched the video for Perfect Strangers and I knew I just had to hear that song and have it permanently embedded in my brain. From the mountain-shattering organ at the beginning to the thundering classical structure at the end this song is heavy and haunting with Gillan singing like no one else could. I love his vocals on the title track and decided I had to find whatever I could with him singing.   Looking back, I feel Gillan's voice tends to get a little whiny sounding at times and because of that I cannot get as thrilled about Wasted Sunsets as some other reviewers. But the aspects of his voice that I love are on the title track and most other songs on the album. I especially love the deep scream after the solo on Under the Gun, something he did well on Black Sabbath's Born Again. For the most part, the album introduces the 1980s generation of hard rock and metal fans to the monsterous sound of Deep Purple, combining both the thunder of the past and a new modern sound for 1984. When other bands were busy playing with synthesizers, Deep Purple brought back the hammond organ. Sadly, the following album explored a more commercial sound that didn't have the same grab-you-by-the-balls-and-throw-you-through-a-brick-wall kind of feel to it. This album stands alone in rock history. Treasure it for all it's worth 
 This book is worth every penny- it is clear and concise and shows you the basics of fashion illustration 
 As an historian who teaches about the Progressive Era, i've been waiting for a book like this for years.  It's simply the best book written on America's peculiar fascination with race and the obsession with defining a hierarchy of races in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  There has certainly been enough attention paid to Spencer et al and the progression of thought on how intellectuals confronted the problem of race in the late 19th century, but no book has ever treated the subject with such acumen.  Jacobson joins David Roediger as the preeminent writers on America's struggle to reconcile it's claim to being the world's melting pot with the reality of it's ongoing propensity to relegate "savages" and lesser races/ethnicities to the margins of society.  
 This one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even Booth has a heart...well, more so than we already know.  The ending got me, I got misty over it.  Enjoy with someone you love 
 This biography is well-done, far superior to Peter Ackroyd's dull and uninspired "Life."  What's most important about Lyndall Gordon's biography is her ability to provide us with a roadmap of Eliot's spiritual life and growth, which is a key to grasping the import of Eliot's poems.  The inner life, by definition, is extremely difficult for someone else to grasp, and even more difficult to describe for others, but Gordon has managed to arrive at an understanding of Eliot's spiritual life, and to put it into good solid prose for the rest of us.  I found this book to be most helpful.  Gordon's insights into the inner life of T.S. Eliot are recommended for anyone interested in the man and the poems 
 I took this course via correspondence with Dr. Virkler as the instructor.  This is a superb book with very sound Bible study techniques.  It teaches the importance of literal translation- meaning: finding the author's intended meaning. The process he teaches is flexible and applies to all types of reading, although it is tailored to the study of God's Word.  The book teaches us to let go of our predisposed ideas if they conflict with what is found in Scripture.  He teaches all the tools to finding the information needed to get to the true meaning of Scripture.  If we all followed these principles, the divisions between Christians would be all-but-nonexistent 
 This is a very good book, it shows you how to make nice hemp bracelets. What I don't like is that there is not enough pages 
 You might not guess it from the title, but this is the play by Michael Frayn that for several years attracted full house at Broadway and at theaters in London. Background: The atomic bomb was built in Los Alamos during WW II by American scientists, and it signaled in 1945 the start of what we now call the Cold War. But it also ended WW II. Parallel to Los Alamos, German scientists in Leipzig worked on building a nuclear reactor, and the bright young Werner Heisenberg was an undisputed leader of the German fission project. However the science itself originated in Europe. The play has three characters, Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and Margrethe Bohr, and the location is the private home of the Bohrs. The book and the play paint a compelling picture of the three. When I went to the play in London, the audience sat in stitches for the whole two hours. I didn't see anyone dozing off, not even during the technical parts of the play. And they most certainly weren't just scientists. Much has been written about the other early atomic scientists, not directly part of the play, e.g., Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassman, to mention just a few. During WW II, in the Fall of 1941, while Denmark was under Nazi occupation, Werner Heisenberg traveled from Leipzig to Copenhagen to see his mentor Niels Bohr. WH had just been 25 years old when he did the work for which he won the Nobel Prize, and in WH's early career, Bohr had become a father figure to the boyish and insecure Werner Heisenberg. The much younger WH was 40 when he visited the Bohrs. Michael Frayn imagines that the three, the Bohrs and Werner Heisenberg meet in after-life to re-live the fateful 1941 encounter, and to resolve WH's motives for his Copenhagen visit; a visit that clearly ended a long and deep friendship. The Bohrs viewed it as a hostile visit, and that never changed, even though Bohr never spoke about what was said in 1941; not then and not later. WH had chosen to stay in Germany after the War broke out in 1939. Why? Did, or did he not, work on the bomb for Hitler? While we may never know the answer, the play offers five possible answers, and we must choose for ourselves. The story really begins before 1941 with the foundation of quantum mechanics in the 1920ties. WH's first paper in Z Physik (1925) is a scientific and a historical mile stone, and it is thought to be the beginning of quantum theory. It is from there we have the ubiquitous notion of 'uncertainty' (of simultaneous quantum observations of position and momentum.) The papers of the three giants Heisenberg, Schrodinger, and Dirac in the 1920ties made precise the theory and the variables: states, observables, probabilities, the uncertainty principle, dual variables, and the equations of motion. This was also when the wave-particle question received a more precise mathematical formulation, and resolution. Perhaps best known are the equation of Schrodinger, giving the dynamics of systems of quantum mechanical particles, and Dirac's equation for the electron. All three of the pioneers won the Nobel Prize at a young age;-- Schrodinger was a little older than the other two (Heisenberg and Dirac were both born in 1902.) Many of the young physicists spent time in Copenhagen in the period between the wars, and Bohr was a mentor to them, and to WH he was perhaps even a father figure. Comment: In 1932, John von Neumann who had just settled in the US showed, surprisingly at the time, that Schrodinger's formulation is equivalent to Heisenbergs matrix mechanics, and von Neumann turned quantization into a field of mathematics. After WWII, Heisenberg resumed his work on the theoretical aspects of quantum fields and other areas of mathematical physics, and he was active as a scientific advisor to post war German government officials. He also wrote books of a more philosophical bent. However they do not settle the question from Copenhagen 1941 
 What can I say its a movie. It came in great condition, the disc wasn't scratched. 
 I was happy that I could find this!  The order arrived on time.  Thanks. 
 This book can help you only if you help yourself.  If you apply what is written then it should help with your level of ability. To what level is up to you.  I find it very comprehensive and worthy of its' price 
 'Space Station 7th Grade' is a great, funny, and enertaining book. My son is in the seventh grade and reading this book was like reading a real life story of a kid new to middle school.   I really enjoyed the part of the book when Jason first had to take a shower after PE. Students having to run around in a huge shower room together naked as jay birds is many elementary kids 'worst nightmare'. My son's PE teacher has really good pointers, www bganssle com tsshowers html, for parents and kids who share this worry. Kids who feel awkward about their first showers at school, trust me and be like Jason in the book and give it a try. Soon any discomfort will pass.   Do you have a son or daughter about to start middle school? Have them read Space Station 7th Grade. My son had to learn many new things when starting middle school, the book was a like a guide book to prepare him 
 I'm not Buddhist, but I love reading this book.  It doesn't have to be read all at once, or in order, and is great to digest a couple pages at a time.  I got it from the library and had to get my own copy, because there was so much I had to underline!  Pema Chodron's writing style is like talking to an older, wiser, kind friend.  A great book even when things aren't falling apart 
 I know many would probably disagree, but I would have to say this is my favorite of Mirah's albums. C'Mon Miracle has a sort of natural flow to it as if all of this was pent up inside of her head for years and this was the product of her relieving her brain of all of the genious creativity. I also like that it's lacking in some of those backround noises from previous albums that I always felt to be so quirky they were almost obnoxious. As if some of them were put in to make the music more "abstract" or "experimental", but mostly took away from the music as opposed to adding to it. This album is beautiful because it's so honest. And perfect for those of us that live in Seattle 
 Any child with a sensitivity to animals would find the violence in this 1955 groundbreaking British animated feature very disturbing; many of the farm animals suffer terrible cruelty at the hands of both Farmer Jones and the pigs that succeed him, so parents should use care and discernment since sometimes this film is represented as a "cartoon".  The script is based on George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and retains much of its brilliance, and is narrated by Gordon Heath, with character actor Maurice Denham speaking all the animal parts.  Orwell wrote "Animal Farm" with the Stalinist Soviet Union in mind, but the tale could apply to any totalitarian regime, many which start with the socialistic "one for all-all for one" idealism and propaganda. The animation is fairly simple compared to what one is used to today, but the images are powerful, and very moving. The plight of Boxer the horse and his devoted friend Benjamin the donkey is wrenching, and beautifully drawn. The sound effects are also excellent, as well as the score by Matyas Siber, which has some songs that imitate the Soviet military style, with one of them cleverly vocalized by animal sounds.   This film is now in public domain, and there are some DVDs issued at a rock bottom price, which don't include the extras; I have one that has a fairly good transfer, with an adequate (considering the price) color reproduction of its Technicolor hues.  Directed by Jay Batchelder and John Halas, this one is a classic, but too dark and upsetting for young children. Total running time is 73 minutes. 
 Just as scientists can sometimes predict when a volcano is going to burst, this book can teach parents to recognize their own tell-tale signs of anger.  It discusses the different types of anger, and explains how to keep anger under control to avoid those damaging volanic-like bursts of anger.  Written with humor, devotion, and a "from the heart" attitude, this book is for anyone who really wants to be helped.  By no means is this book a magic pill.  Just reading it won't make your home life any better.  Like any good self-help book you have to actually apply the principles to see a difference.  Yes, the book does direct readers to have a better relationship with God, but as the song goes "Jesus is the answer for the world today, above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way."  To those who commented that the book is "too religious" I wonder if they read the back cover of the book at all.  It uses the word "God" and "biblical counsel" to let you know the theories of the book are biblically based.  And the book is also published by Harvest House Publishers, which sells almost exclusively Chrisitan material.  I know I don't purchase books without reading the covers and excerpts because I want to make sure I'm getting the most out of my money.  If those readers didn't want a book referencing religion they should have done more homework when selecting a self-help book.  Thank you, Julie Ann Barnhill, for your honesty and this well-written, helpful book 
 I reccommend Inside the Minstrel Mask. A fascinating survey of the minstrel show, including some of the songs and skits that were popular. Also includes some astute analysis.  Gary Winter Playwrigh 
 This little gizmo is marvellous. You can hook your iPod up to your existing home theatre/music system. Don't have to buy an an iPod dock music system. Fantastic 
 Sorry, Fern, but I didn't like this book nearly as well as Publish a Book in 30 Days. At least a 1/3 of the book (maybe even half) is Fern marketing hype and lists (like library and college addresses) that can be pulled off the Internet. Many of the internet links no longer work. Too many recommendations are out of the financial reach of a self-publisher or off the wall (i.e. hold a book signing in a laundromat). I think it would be a better book if it was edited to half the current length.  And here's an annoying (abeit minor) problem... the book won't lay flat! I had to use a brick to hold it open while I went paragraph to paragraph checking out the recommended action or Internet site. It drove me nuts! Switch to wire-O next time.  All that said, I still think it's worth every cent of the cover price. I guarantee that you'll find some marketing angle that had never even crossed your mind before 
 I wish my parents had bought this book for me when I was a teen. I have 2 daughters and will have them read this when they are old enough 
 Dr. Murphy writes a good story.  The book is a description of his personal experience in Santeria.  It should be noted that he is not an initiate, but he writes in a sympathetic, informed and respectful way about the religion.  Even though he is an academic, this book is written in a non-academic style.  If you are curious about santeria it is a must read 
 Gould's music is so beautifully crisp and clean that it's always an amazement, but this recording makes you feel that he's in the room with you! This 1974 recording was released in 1977 and remastered in 20-bit technology in 2001 for Sony Classical. Crystal-clear recording--Enjoy every minute of it 
 "It's not the end of the world at all," he said. "it's only the end off us. The world will go on just the same, only we shan't be in it. I dare say it will get along all right without us"...  I finally brought myself a copy of On The Beach. Since seeing the film (the ending of which still devastates me to this day) there was no way that I was going to bypass the book. Books are usually better than film. I'm not sure that is the case with this one.  The story is about so many things- about hope, politics, desire, love and mortality. How would you be if you were faced with the knowledge that in less than a year you and your family would suffer a terrible and excruciating death? The story looks more at the way that people would cope with the situation- the denial, the constant ache of knowing that you would never get to do the things that you always wanted, the boredom of having to wait. The book however elicited less emotion than the film. Not so much the story as the way that it was written. The baby was more often 'it' than 'she', his descriptions were flat and the generational gap was wide. Nowadays men have more liberty to share and show their emotions, though Shute's male characters are all very middle of the century `men must be men'. The father shows little to no emotion or connection to his family, the child is but a thing. That doesn't mean that it wasn't any good. I was still on the brink of tears and it was a very good story that will stay with me for a very long time, I just wish that I had read it before I watched the movie.  I know that I will be passing this book on because someone needs to read it. It's a great book on so many levels. Political stupidity, human nature, reality. Read it. I'd give it 4 and a half stars if I could. Four isn't enough, five is too much 
 I typically don't read comedic books, but was recommended to read this and I think it was a good choice.    I thought Liv Kellerman was a funny character and enjoyed her whiny, yet very spunky attitude.  She didn't want hand-outs but sulked a lot.  A funny...and, come on women, very normal combo.    The story-line in general I would categorize as a page turner filled with light humor.  I enjoyed how BELLE brought many characters full circle.  Her first employer, the blind judge, with this hilarious comments about her to his date.  Dale, the manly woman she works for as a real estate agent, coming up strategically toward the end.  A co-worker she hates comes back along with her worst client following in her footsteps.  The one person I wanted to hear more about at the end was the infamous Andrew.  Could've used a little more of a tie-up with him.  After their "incident" together you don't really hear anything more about him.  The only reason I rate it with a 4 instead of 5 is I'm not one for all the language.  I think it would've been just as funny without all the f-bombs...but that's just me.  I think it would be a hilarious romantic comedy film (Maggie Gyllanhaal would be a great Liv) and could actually be translated pretty well into a sit-com series called "High Maintenance".  I haven't read "Going Down" yet but will purchase soon.  Looking forward to future books from BELLE.. 
 My six year old (who has NEVER been very excited about exercise) really loves this DVD. The routine is active, fun and most importantly easy to learn.  Other videos have simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or very little instruction was offered. She completed the workout the first day and when she woke up the next morning, she asked to do it again! My 2 1/2 year old has a great time "dancing" with us as well 
 The book gives a understanding of how gamling works. It explains the fluctation that create illusions among players. Illusions about how good they are, what card that makes a profit. If you want to be a serious poker player, this book gives you a fundamental understanding that you fail to find in other poker books 
 Banish writer's block forever with Deena Metzger's Writing  for Your Life. This boldly titled book is packed with  inspirational material for the writer and creative writing  teacher.There are many, many books on the market promising  to unleash the imaginations of beginning writers -   Metzger's actually delivers the goods. Her writing exercises   confront, challenge and provoke. They are tickets to the   most exciting journey of your life - an exploration of the  human heart. If a book could turn a person into a writer,   this is the book. Of course, just reading cannot do that   trick. Metzger, however, makes the idea of writing so   exciting that the blank page no longer intimidates but  invites. If I were shipwrecked, I would take Writing for  Your Life, reams and reams of paper, enough pens for a   lifetime and M F K Fisher's The Art of Eating - but that's  another story... 
 Rodeo's roots may be in the primitive West of the past, but today it's prime-time TV material, even while steeped in tradition, filled with pros and tours. Journalist W.K. Stratton followed the pro rodeo circuit for one year, exploring the history of chutes to its current popularity and uncovering myths and realities alike. His findings about the people and politics of today's rodeo make for lively reading in Chasing The Rodeo: On Wild Rides And Big Dreams, Broken Hearts And Broken Bones, And One Man's Search For The West. A spirited account of today's wild riders. 
 I find reading Wallace Stevens a wonderfully strange and rewarding experience.  The words all seem familiar and yet when I ask myself what exactly has been said, specifics become elusive.  Let us leave aside awful writers whose opaqueness is all they have to offer. Great writers are often difficult, but for various reasons. Some writers are difficult because their vision is so personal: William Blake for instance.  Reading some authors is difficult because of cultural remove.  To the extent that Shakespeare is difficult he can become readily understandable simply by reading him enough.  The strangeness of the language falls away with familiarity and Shakespeare's endless depths become viewable if still unreachable.  Stevens is difficult for several other reasons.  First, he uses language differently.  The images he uses and creates are not the point of his work.  Rather, they are a means of connotation and require some digging and wrestling.  It is the accretion of direct and attached meaning that gives his poetry its full weight. Second, at times there is no direct meaning - it is about the sound and the sense of an image without actually being able to label it.  For example, what exactly is a firecat or a buck clattering over Oklahoma?   You think you know, but once you start asking yourself for a definition you can't find one.  You can make it up, but what is the point?  It is really the sound and sense of meaning that matters here.  Also, he does have a cultural context that we assume is current enough that we share it with him.  Actually, it is a time with certain assumptions and intellectual fads that have passed without a trace.  Not being aware of them can add an unnecessary obscurity.  But it is all worth it.  Great writers pay off rich dividends because of the way they expand your sense of the language.  Stevens is powerfully unique and opens a whole new wing in the mansion of beautiful letters.  This is poetry you can explore for a lifetime and still find new ways to appreciate and enjoy.  This is a fine edition that brings together all his collected poems, many that were never put in collections, essays, a couple of short plays, some letters, a chronology, and textual notes.  I feel indebted to the Library of America for this wonderful book.  
 I got these speakers because the speakers on my Thinkpad are incredibly weak.  I was interested in a nice pair of 2.1 speakers that would not cost too much, and I found a great deal in these speakers.   The speakers sound great, with crisp sound.  Also, there is very little sound distortion at the louder volume settings.  The woofer is also works well, providing decent bass in both music and movies.  Besides it's overall audio quality, I find that the Z-4is have a pleasant aesthetic also, as they have a nice glossy white finish.    Overall, I'd say these speakers are a great buy for anyone who's looking for a good set of relatively inexpensive speakers.  They are not for serious audiophiles, but for anyone looking to beef up their PC's sound systems should definitely look into this set.  
 It's a big world, but we Americans seem to reside in a small one, at least those of us fortunate enough to be insured and able to afford the health care we need. Many fellow US citizens cannot afford to be sick or ill at all, yet their needs may be tended only once they are so ill that emergency room care is required, but maybe not even then. Then there are the desperately poor of other nations and whole regions of the world that have virtually no care at all. This book is about those folks and medicine as it is currently practiced and dispensed here and abroad. Author Doctor Paul Farmer shows that modern medical practice violates the very ethos that spawned the impulse to heal in the first place.  This book has a lot of structural problems that, while off-putting, are easily ignored by the enormous contribution Farmer makes to our understanding of a set of topics that most of us have not thought about at all. This is an important and inspired book, one that is clear and easy to read, although marred by redundancy that a good editor might have helped eliminate. The thesis topic is that the desperately poor deserve more attention, not less as they now are accorded, because they are more vulnerable by definition. Farmer successfully questions the allocation of our resources toward corporate profits rather than treating the poor of the world.  Farmer's case studies based on his experience of working in Boston, Hattie, and the Russian Republic amply illustrate that our health care priorities are backward and unjust at best, pernicious and self defeating at worst. Every medical ethics course in the US ought to require this along with, or in place of, their existing textbooks that grind over the hoary issues of abortion and euthanasia, and a lot of other topics that are luxuries of a rich society that all but ignores those in greatest need 
 My 5.5 yr old son LOVES this book!  He renewed it  for four weeks at the school library  before they made him turn it in, and then cried about it.  The book teaches kids about different kinds of fire fighters. Most of us think of a fire fighters down at the fire station but it also  encompasses  smoke jumpers, water front fire fighters and more. I found it interesting to read to him too 
 The quality is just excellent on this product.  I am very picky about the wallet so it could be improved if the money clip was a different style and held the bills on the inside.  If you are used to a money clip but want room for credit cards and ID to stay secure, you will love this 
 this Book should Bring People Together.The Black Panthers wanted a Better  Today.still to this day we are facing the same Problems of which they spoke  on 30 years back.no misguided words here their own words.a must Read for  all to Better understanding Voices of Hope&a Better Tommorow for all  future Generations 
 This book starts out by giving you a good history behind the shader language.   Pro: - really good for references - it lists every single variables/functions for the shader along with the description - excellent information/reference on Intrinsic Functions - it has a good list of vertex shader 3.0 assembly instructions  Con: - need more samples? :)  Overall, I found this book is good to start learning HLSL. Besure that you've grabbed a concept of direct3d before reading this book. I also find out that after reading this book it's so much easy to read wolf's books.  
 But that's because Keith is an alien himself.  When a collective of hip hop enthusiasts from the Ego Trip staff ranked Kool Keith as the number 19th greatest emcee of all-time (one ahead of Tupac) in there book of lists, they were not taking it lightly.  He wasn't your standard A-B rhymer.  He was shattering rules of rhyme structure since his glory days with the Ultramagnetic Mcs.  He always possessed an unorthodoxed off-beat flow, passionate vocal tone, and boasts so brazen they stunned his listener into silence.  Who would have thought that the leader of that group would turn into a perverse alien who happened to have his record drop from another planet to turn from thermal nuclear residue to Earth in compact format (read the album cover notes to understand where i'm comin' from).       Dr. Octagon is a groundbreaking release that is best enjoyed after countless listens.  The best records are the ones you have to go back over and decipher new meanings.  Never one to waste a rhyme, Keith opens up with "3000" on some bugged out wordplay, "Channels and handles Automator's on the panels/  turnin knobs you slobs suckers like Baskin Robs/carvel don't tell your whole crew is ice cream fudge/rappers that budge makin moves step in grooves/and ride the pace like at thirty-three dark shades/ now you seein me/ rap moves on to the year three thousand".  Just a few bars of his breathless liners doesn't do the space alien gynocologist much justice.  You could spend your whole summer vacation trying to get a grasp on these otherworldly phrases.         Even with the off the wall lyricism, the album wouldn't be the nearly enjoyable experience if it wasn't for Dan Automators genius turntable techniques and sci-fi horror backdrops.  Just peep "Halfsharkhalfalligatorman" (long winded title!) and the incredible "Blue Flowers" for proof!  The album is just filled with surprises at every corner.  However, no other song on Dr. Octagon captivated me more than "Girl, Let Me Touch You".  To this day, it stands as one of my personal all-time favorite non-singles on any hip hop record.  Automators production is effortlessly hypnotic, Keith's persona is as abstact as ever, and no matter what mood I was in...the song would just set things straight.  In conclusion, Dr. Octagon is a stone cold classic.  I don't care how many non-believers this record sparked.  So what if he's different.  His individuality separates Keith from the rest.  How many emcees have the ability to go as far to credit "Kelly Wootang" on drums and "Curt Kobane" on vocals (you should be buggin' out with those references).  Besides, too many hip hop records take themselves way too seriously with yet far too many more gimmicks.  Kool Keith doesn't care.  He wouldn't take sides, regarding the Tupac Biggie beef.  He would rather diss both of them and be done with it (Pluckin' Cards ring a bell)?  Keith would put out some good material after this, but after "Sex Styles", there was far too much B.S.  Hell, even DJ Shadow got in on one cut and this was the same year he put out the timeless, "Endtroducin'".  Grab this record anyway you can before it criminally goes out of print 
 At first, when I listened to this album, I was completely turned off. It sounded like a complete, random mess. But the more I listened to it, the more I understood the beauty in the music. The story the sound tells, even without hardly any lyrics at all. Brilliant album 
 I do not know why this book was never more popular. It is a great read and has lots of detail on the evolution of computer R&D.  It is a very well written and detailed book about the computer R&D from Boston-Washington to Palo Alto at HP - written like a smooth flowing novel. It is mainly about Xerox and the research people and how they eventually decided to move the computer R&D to California. But it includes a lot more stuff. It Includes DARPA funding of the internet and work at MIT, and in house fighting at Xerox, and then the evolution of the projects in California. Xerox did not run with the ball in an effective way post 1980 but the technology and people went on to other companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and HP. Also there was a lot of innovative work that was transferred to industry.  It gives a lot of insight into the evolution of computer systems and the internet and local networks and on and on. It covers the people - grad students, scientists, spin off companies, crazed computer types working all night - that are just as interesting as the wires and machines.  Great book, one of the best ever Tech Books 
 I love this book!  I was drawn in by Kate's story - living on a barge floating up the French countryside and wanted to read more about that.  Kate not only took me on a beautiful journey but also shared some of her favorite recipes with me.    I thought French cooking was fancy and difficult but these recipes are not.  They're simple, fresh, and just great.  I can picture her walking through a farmers market creating these meals based on the produce available.   The book is beautiful and Kate is a wonderful guide.  Thank you for sharing your travels with me.  When I cook from this book I turn on the radio, pour a glass of wine, and travel back to France 
 I loved this book!  I am a huge fan of romance, mystery and intrigue and this book has it all.  Not only will it make you feel fuzzy inside with the  romance, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat, make you really  hate the villain, and make you cry.  It is also a great Christian novel as  well.  Diane Noble did a fantastic job writing this book.  I can't wait to  read the next one 
 This album is perfect. Picked it up today after hearing only the first track, and it is beyond what I expected. It is beautiful in every sense of the word. The songwriting, the lyrics, the packaging... All of it was worth every penny. I would have gladly paid five times what I did for the album. I love it, and I think anyone who enjoys good music, expecially techno-type bedroom pop will love it. I give it a five 
 I first read Leopold's "Almanac" in 1981 as part of my undergraduate studies in ecology and now as a teacher make it part of our class reading because of Leopold's artistic ability with diction. However,only when I received this latest edition as a gift from students did I realize how little I understood the beauty of Sand County; Michael Sewell walked Leopold's footsteps and captured in brilliant color the world of Wisconsin that so inspired this poetic icon. Perhaps the greatest gift I've ever received from students 
 A compelling book,loaded with insightful comments of the way customers responses at the retail world, ideas gathered in many years of  experience the author and his team had expended watching people behave naturaly in a retail enviroment. A good book for business people interested in learning consumer behavior in a practical sense.  You might get dissapointed if the title of book led you to think you will find conceptualized steps for merchandising sucess, even the lessons the author gave are fact based they are encompassed by american culture and might fall short in sight for ethnic markets. However, Paco Underhill show us a great example how taking a closer look to customers interactions at stores can reveal us the obvious -but often overlooked- thruth: shopping is a pleasure experience, the more the senses get pleased the more the products/brands are prefered 
 The Language of Animals is THE BEST communication book on the market.  It is clear and concise - a step by step plan that anyone can follow. Carol offers great exercises with fun and interesting examples.  I just ordered a dozen to sell at my How to Communicate with Animals workshops. Thanks Carol for a fantastic book that will enlighten and help millions 
 That some authors can so quickly descend into disfavor is baffling. Consider Robert Ludlum being forgotten in fifty years.  But that was the fate of Rafael Sabatini, an author of some of the most engaging swashbuckling fiction written in the English language. Peter Blood, a veteran of the high seas, but now a humble doctor in Bridgewater, is sold into slavery in the West Indies after an unfortunate rebellion - of which he had no direct part - in support of the duke of Monmouth. This incident is a catalyst for his metamorphosis to a bucanneer. A pirate with honor, Blood rescues ladies in distress, plunders treasure-laden ships, while preventing razing of conquered territory. His love for a woman constrains him, but will she love him back? Sabatini offers a romance set on the high seas. Captain Blood has some similarities with his other works - the utility of knowledge, the cultured protagonist acting against his nature, and the efficacy of laughter. When Blood tells Arabella, "A man must sometimes laugh at himself or go mad," it is faintly reminiscent of the opening line of Bellarion, Sabatini's famous novel.  An engaging read, The Odyssey of Captain Blood, though less imposing than a Dumas, offers a wonderful way to spend time 
 This movie is a little known treasure.  I can remember watching it several times growing up, but nobody else I know has ever seen it. Real Men has been very difficult to find, and it has never been released on a DVD format until know. I strongly suggest you buy this movie (especially at this price!). It has a high replay value (almost like BLues Brothers) and it will keep you entertained for years to come 
 I'm a fan of Five for Fighting so was interested in the new album.  I found the last one a little disappointing, aside from a couple of good songs.  This one however shows a return to form.  THere are some great songs on this CD, from Freedom Never Cries right through to Johnny America.  It's one of those CD's that I can listen to over and over without getting sick of it.  
 I picked up this book, determined to be a better pet owner. And I'm grateful to the Monks of New Skete for preparing such a thoughtful, educational text for people like me. This is a wonderful book that taught me a lot about my dog, why she acts the way she does, and what I can do about unwanted behavior. From the birth of these loyal, precious animals to testing for temperament, then moving toward training, I've developed a much better understanding of what it means to work with a puppy. Or rather, to train myself. This text is highly recommended for all dog owners, regardless of age, for it contains a wealth of information that should be shared with everyone before bringing home a loving pet such as a dog. Another great book for dog owners that I recommend is "Cesar's Way" by Cesar Milla 
 I have been scrapbooking for 10 years and this is the best book about scrapping that I have ever read!  It is truly an inspiration.  Even after 10 years, I found many new ideas and new ways to look at my hobby.  I recommend this book for seasoned and new scrappers alike 
 Ok so who cannot love this movie!??  Well a few, but we loved it and that may have to do with the fact that we love Keanu Reeves.  The HD DVD disc is really cool and the menus are sweet as well.  Like another reviewer mentioned there wasn't any sex scenes.  Surprised at first but though maybe it was time that every movie doesn't have gratuitous sex scenes.  If you watch the extras you will see alternate endings which were cool.  You also get to see a scene where their was supposed sex with the girl with the tail.  You won't know she has a tail LOL until you see that deleted scene.  Downside is that the extra scenes are in bad quality, seem that they came straight from the reel.  Again, loved the plot and would love to see him reprise the role.  Gotta love Gabriel and the Devil 
 There are a LOT of guides to starting your own business out there. In the past ten years, I've read most of them. And I have yet to start my own business, unless you consider blogging a business. Maybe non-profit?  Most of the guides I've read end up sounding like a pep rally for self employment. They talk up the positives and downplay the negatives. And I think that's the benefit of this book -- the negatives are shown. But the negatives aren't presented as problems -- they're presented as obstacles that can easily be surmounted with the proper amount of forethought and planning.  Stephanie Chandler writes as someone who has experience -- she's started her own business after what most would call a successful career in Silicon Valley. She did her research when she went out on her own (which is what most budding entrepreneurs fail to do). She found out why businesses fail, and what can be done to prevent that failure. She talks about overcoming the fear of starting a business from scratch. She speaks positively of franchising as an option for entrepreneurs (though it's not THE option).   Another strength of this book is the inclusion of "Entrepreneur Profiles" in each chapter. These profiles show what successful small business owners went through in getting their business going, and what problems they had to confront. Knowing that someone else has traveled the path already, and faced many of the same obstacles, can help to motivate potential entrepreneurs to take the final step.  58% of all Americans have at least considered starting their own business. If more of them had read this book, and adopted Chandler's policies (especially in researching available opportunities), more of them would be successful small business owners 
 to stay in my house!  Having recently gone through a divorce, and somewhat uncomfortable with my neighborhood, which has a very different demographic from mine, I struggled with how I could manage the house on my own, and finance numerous small and large repairs without taking on too much debt.  After taking the quiz, I realized that the financial stability of my house is the most important factor I needed to satisfy.  Once I realized that...it was much easier to invest a few thousand dollars to update the furnishings and to make the house more like a home that reflected my personality.  I was also able to take on additional debt to make some costly, but necessary repairs, such a new foundation and sewer line.  In doing so, I found a way to restructure my entire debt load that allows me one smaller monthly payment, leaving me with a greater monthly cash flow.  I can honestly say that I wouldn't have had the courage to undertake the repairs, and take on the additional debt, if I hadn't read this book.  Having a clear insight into my issues surrounding "home" and understanding more clearly my emotional profile, I was able to make my need structure work in my favor, instead of against me.  Without this book, I would probably have sold the house at a discount, and made another, equally unsatisfying move 
      Mostly a collection of memos. This book is only a record to let us know what some of the hub bub is all about.  Let us not sweep this under the rug.  This is a first step in our examination of what we are and what we may become if each citizen doesn't accept responsibility and act on what is rapidly becoming a standard operating proceedure.  Does torture acheive better information, Or blind us to truth?  The same amount of time spent in a search for evidence would give results. Evidence gained by torturing is an illusion that has caused the torturer to become a goon.  Calling torture by some other name does not change its effect.  Torture destroys its victims and demoralizes its perpetrators. For those who are pleased to dominate it gives dominance.  Torture does not give facts because it is not physical evidence.  The veracity of uncovered facts can not be observed, but must be further tested. Torture can destroy any resistance in the one tortured and give the dominator feelings of the power of god.  The torturer is loosing the battle without physical evidence.  Torturing only gives the feelings of power.   This book is the begining of the examination of official torture and might allow some of us to reconfirm that torture by any name is only the act of a despot and only dispoils free citizens 
 This book has made my life infinitely EASIER. Gave the answers I was looking for a long time. It tells you very simple (effective)ways to tackle those dilemmas. Among the 9 advices I chose 3 important ones for me:'  1.-Respect your stress tolerance level, learning HOW to say "no" sometimes.  2.-Be sincere and authentic in your relationships. It gives you TECHIQUES to tell people (in a polite way) what you want, can or can't do, what you actually expect from them, what wrong, bad things they have done to you.   3.-How to handle people that are mourning. We normally do the wrong thing.  In my case it was really worth the money. I used to be one of those TOO NICE People. Thanks DUKE ROBINSON!.   
 This is a great item to buy if you have hard wood floor, which collect alot of dust.  It's amazing how much dirt the swiffer lifts from your floors.  I was very impressed and would highly recommend this product 
 A newer release of the 1968 publication (see my more extensive comments under ASIN= 0877281033), it's a translation of 3 Zohar portions, commentary on the Book of Concealed Mystery, & notes on the Greater Holy Assembly & Lesser Holy Assembly.  Mathers did Kabbalists a service rendering these into English almost a century ago, but the later Simon & Sperling version (2000 pages long, ASIN= 0900689390) is more complete.  Mathers version occasionally reflects his Christian occultism, but mostly provides useful observations & cross-cultural parallels.  While his comments are helpful, they only scratch the surface of the deep symbolism.  He shows parallels with alchemy & (as Jung approached alchemy), meaning emerges with extensive reading/study.  However, Mathers': archaic language, spelling (e.g. words with excess letters), incorrect use of I vs. Y, & retention of Latin passages (based on Knorr von Rosenrath's somewhat suspect, `Kabbala Denudata') make the work less accessible to modern readers.  It also contains some errors & omissions (e.g. Gematria 18 = Hebrew "life").  The 3 parts translated here are perhaps the most occult in the Zohar, seemingly a commentary on the Shi'ur Komah literature's symbolically physical description of God.  It's an extremely esoteric work.  Some of its significant points are:  1) Male & Female are equal in Kabbalah.  "Where there is unbalanced force, there is the origin of evil." 2) 4 completes 3 = Carl Jung's Quaternity = Mathers' quaternary--"The trinity is always completed by & finds its realization in the quaternary." 3) "For commencement denotes end, & end denotes commencement; how, then, in the Absolute can there be either?  Nevertheless, in the Absolute must we seek for the hypothetical starting-point of life." This is quite similar to Tibetan Buddhist ideas of origination or (more accurately) lack thereof 
 When I first bought this book, I thought it would be quite dull.  Boy, was I wrong.  I loved it from start to finish.  Kipling shines as a a master humorist and storyteller, and through my reading of "Just So Stories" I never once had to stretch myself wondering why he was so popular in his day and why he won the Nobel Prize.  His work speaks for itself.  I really likes his commentaries on his own pictures. -"I should like to paint him with paint-box colours, but I am not allowed." -"Pau Amma is trying to make a Magic, but he is only a silly old King Crab, and so he can't do anything." -"It is all a magic picture, and that is one of the reasons why I haven't drawn the Jaguar's whiskers."  Absolutely wonderful 
 First, this book is difficult to read because the encyclopedic style of the text is so dry.  The author offers many details and did most of his research first hand in the early 1870s.  Powers was primarily concerned with writing about authentic native american traditions and not habits adapted from the europeans such as the Spanish who came before him.  If some of Powers' information is from other sources, he cites them by name.   This book covers 25 small tribes including the Karok, Yurok, Tolowa, Hupa, Patawat, Pomo, Yokaia, Gallinomero, Wintun, Modok and Yosemite.    With each tribe the author writes geographic details, language details such as numbers, food preparation and dancing or celebration details.  It is truly amazing how different these tribes were in terms of their customs and behavior.  While all were living in relatively primitive conditions, the social behavior was distinct between the various tribes.  Be warned that there is a racial overtone to the book such as when the author writes "Once more I must assert, at whatever risk, that there were occasional passages in these barbaric chants which were very beautiful indeed."  (chapter XXII The Kabinapek)    Overall, Tribes of California is a very informative ethnological study of many tribes that had surprising differences in culture.   
 This delightful rhyming story takes the reader on the adventure of Edward the Emu, who decides being an Emu is boring, and travels around the zoo, trying to be other animals, only to discover that perhaps being an Emu is the best thing there is. With its fantastic illustrations, and rollicking rhymes, this would make a great bedtime story (and it isn't too long for parents who start dropping off to sleep when pressed into reading for ages each night) 
 This was a treat.  Written in the begining of the 19th century it is still dead on.  Even after reading a score of trading books this one reads fresh.  It's the kind of book that is short but brilliant and which you will find yourself rereading. Wonderful little apercues on market pyschology. Much of it, you already know if you're an old hand, but expressed in a way that brings it home to you. Very well written. A joy to read. 
 A wonderful way to learn the alphabet is using nature to represent each  letter.  Jerry Pallotta has offered yet another text with this format to  add to his previous fifteen Nature Alphabet Books.  This time, Pallotta  marches out different species of butterflies for each letter, from "A  is for Apollo" through "Z is for Zephyr Metalmark."  The  text on each page invites children to pour over pictures of butterflies  while associating each butterfly with its name.  Readers must look closely  to discover hidden characteristics, hunting , for example, to find the  poodle face on the "Dogface" butterfly's wings.  Realistic,  colorful pictures display each butterfly as if momentarily suspended before  a reader who dares not breath for fear of frightening the creature away.   The older butterfly guru can learn new information about butterflies, where  each lives, and a fact about each-the Magdalene Alphine lives high in the  mountains and has black wings that absorb sunlight and keep it warm.  For  young elementary children, Jerry Pallotta intertwines reading and learning  as he provides pictures and information about butterflies from all parts of  the world while teaching the alphabet 
 Author Perry Mehrling's excellent book is not merely a biography of Fischer Black, but also the story of the main threads of economic thought during the late twentieth century. More than that, it is the story of the economics profession, and of the great role that politics and personality plays in the acceptance of ideas. It is astonishing to learn how ruthlessly the profession excluded Black's ideas, although he was one of the most incisive economic and financial thinkers of his time, and it is inspiring to see how relentlessly and quixotically Fischer Black continued to press them. The parts of the book that are generally accessible are also fascinating. Unfortunately, far too little of the volume is accessible to the average business reader. Mehrling does a less than adequate job of explaining the great themes of Black's life and thought to lay readers. He notes the importance of the Capital Asset Pricing Model in Black's philosophy, but his account of the model will leave noneconomists scratching their heads. The same must be said of his account of other economic subjects. While we find that only readers with a fairly deep understanding of economics can reap this book's full harvest, that caveat should not deter the general reader from gleaning 
 My casette tape case says "revised for the 90's" and this program is. You will hear some of the old and some of the new. Tracy is a master at consultative type selling and at the same time recommend time tested closing techniques that have been working for decades.  Of course only real salespeople would know this. I also recommend the complete album from Nightingale-Conant by the same name by Brian Tracy 
 My wife and I read lots of books this being our first pregnancy. This book is great because it has all kind of practical information and it's written in a way that makes sense--reassuring but not patronizing 
 While I have heard that this album is a bit different from previous releases by the Album Leaf, I cannot really comment because, I admit, this is the first album of theirs that I have heard.  What I can tell you about it though is that it's excellent. It's an album that shoots its atmosphere off into all directions.  It's an album for those times you've been in the car driving for ten hours and the morning is just starting to bleed into the night. To be honest, it's pretty mellow.  I don't think anyone would classify it as 'pump-up' music, but that doesn't detract from it at all. It opens with the wonderfully ambient "Window" which melds into "Thule".  This one-two punch of atmospherics gives a pretty good idea where the album is going.  Vocals pop in for three of the tracks, but mostly the songs just grab hold with their musicality and don't let go. The songs are like walking along a trail in the woods; they take gentle detours here and there and you follow them for the time being, but the detours always return to the main path. Personally, all the songs are pretty enjoyable, but a high point would have to be "The Outer Banks".  It features a skittering low-key electro-beat but really builds an off-kilter intensity by the time it reaches its climax. Sure, it falls a little too low and flat in parts, it's not a perfect record, but it's still pretty good 
 I came to Gustave Flaubert cold. I did not know what to expect, who he was, what his books were about; when I picked up Madame Bovary I would have been hard pressed to put him into the correct century. For a time I was frustrated because I kept searching for 'Gaston Flaubert' on Amazon, so little did I know. I was, after all, lured to him by the indirect references that other authors had made concerning his works. Oscar Wilde in particular made a few (vague) referrals to him in 'The Critic as Artist'.  So I bought this book, skipping the introduction and plowing through the novel. Upon finishing my first thoughts were along the lines of, "I just read a book about a bored country doctor's wife who spends all her efforts in pursuing pleasure, finding nothing but emptiness in it." I don't mean to give away the whole plot...but really, that's it in a nutshell.  Wait. There's more.  This is my thought now: "Wow, so THAT was his intention, eh? He achieved it marvelously! His work ethic was really like that? He strove so hard to find the right word that sometimes he would only do 5 pages in three weeks? Really? My goodness, I should re-examine the passages in the book. Wow...in this light they're really good...I should just..."  And it goes on and on.  I had to get to these thoughts somehow, right? Did I go online and search through Wikipedia for research on the author? Did I take a class on Flaubert? Who was this mysterious teacher that instructed me in the beginnings of this French novelist?  It was none other than this edition. Not only does Bantam include the novel but it also has dropped in essays on it by some very prominent folks. By reading through these after finishing the novel, the true magnitude of it starts to come to the forefront; it's not simply about a country doctor and his wife, it's something much more, something sublime. The thing that Flaubert created starts to become clear, like an image that fades into view from the other side of smoked glass.  Following along this train of thought, even with such a simple subject (as even the author admits in the supplemental sections) there are some pretty profound, beautiful statements that can be garnered from it. Take this one: "Human speech is a cracked cauldron on which we knock out tunes for dancing bears, when we wish to conjure pity from the stars." Take something that is so subliminally supreme and scatter it throughout the book and you have yourself a grand novel that needs to be studied intently.  This might not be for everyone, I admit that too. If you are not into literature; if you are not into the creation process that writers go through, the aesthetic quality aside from the subject matter itself that some people strive to achieve; if you are not a person who can allow themselves to empathize with a character, no matter how depraved that character gets...you will not like this book. If, however, you ARE interested in the process of writing, or writers, you will want to pick up this terrific little book and study it intently for the secrets that it will expose to you.  Bottom line: Simply put, you cannot have a serious literary collection if you do not possess this book. This edition contains a plethora of supplemental material that makes it worth well more than its price.  -LP 
 This is an interesting book that helps to illuminate many of Pakistans faces.  The face of militarism, the various coups and dictators that have ruled the country such as Zia and Musharref.  It highlights the politicians such as Ali Bhutto and his daughter Benezir as well as Newaz Sharif and Ali Jinnah.  The role of Islamism is explained as well as the role of Sharia and Islamic law in Pakistan.  There is some discussion as to the inter-ethnic and tribal problems of the country.  But this book lacks something and that seems to be honesty facing the brutal reality and the true history.  Pakistan and India were born in the same manner, and yet one became a fascist religious dictatorship for most of its life, stoning women who are victims of rape, with radical terrorists using it as a base to murder innocent civilians abroad and overthrow neighboring countries.  With Islam as a national religion it proceeded under fundamentalism to ethnically and religiously cleansed itself of every minority and made it illegal to 'defame' the 'prophet'.  Meanwhile India remained mutli-religious and democratic.  Why?  This book does not dare provide the answers.  There is no talk of how Pakistan was born either, how it was born in blood over the graves of over 100,000 Hindus and SIkhs murdered, and over the forced removal of millions of Sikh and Hindu refugees forced to flee Pakistan so that Pakistan would be 100% Muslim by 1949 while India would be only 75% Hindu.  So the pulling of punches and businesslike way this book is written leaves the reader wondering what else is missing.  Seth J. Frantzman    
 Rifles for Watie Rifles is written by Harold Keith. Rifles is an good made up story of the life of a solider during the Civil War. It reads fast and will decently fill you up with some CivilWar facts, but not too many. Jeff, our main character,r is a boy of 17 and joins up with the North after bushwhackers attack his home. Kansas, 1861 is the setting for this book and it covers all of the Civil War. Jeff has some trouble with his commanding officer. Good for kids 10 and up. If you want a good adventure story, this is the way to go.  
 The advice in Cal Newport's first book helped me get through some tough times in college and eventually win acceptance to the law school of my dreams.  I passed down my copy to my younger brother, who is now himself a college sophomore.  He seemed to enjoy it, and his grades did pick up some this year, so when I saw that Newport had come out with another book, I picked up a copy of this one for him as well.  Looks like more stellar stuff, and I really believe it will help my brother to perform well in college and to achieve many of his goals 
 I loved the Hot Moms Handbook because it is a light, fun ride through the sometimes crazy and trying times of motherhood.  The book shows mothers how to keep their identity while adding the role of "mom", instead of just losing themselves.  I bought this for 5 people for Mother's Day because I knew they would relate to and enjoy the well-written anecdotes while laughing their heads off saying, "Oh yeah, that is soooo true! 
 I am not a huge fan of contemporary fiction of any kind, but James Scott Bell's book gripped me right from the beginning.  I appreciated the realness of the story -- the main character's emotions are just what any other human being could identify with.  The writing is fresh and witty.  This is definitely a read again book for me 
 James Elkins is a masterful writer. His work is very philosophical, though he is an art historian. I heartily recommend all of his books, but The Object Stares Back is my favorite. The books makes me sad, angry, creeped out, proud, excited... Elkins is masterful, clear, and insightful. He forces you to reconsider your ideas about what it means to see and to be seen. Great book 
 The imaginary scene is a boarding house breakfast. Conversation is dominated by a lively gent who's seen it all.  He holds forth on women, school, philosophy, rowing, interrupted from time to time with verses such  as the Deacon's Masterpiece.  It's witty, poignant, and rightfully a  classic 
 As a father and a coach, I have always been concerned whether ot not I am pushing my kids the correct way in order to reach their potential.  This book really sheds light on the fallacies of unconditional love, self-esteem at all costs and the other myths that have been propogated as a backlash to the rigidity of the 1950's.  The biggest challenge to pushing kids to maximize their potential is knowing where to "draw the line" with yourself.  Dr. Taylor does an excellent job at showing you where to draw that line.  He also makes an excellent point that in order to propel your kids in the right direction, you yourself need to be going in the right direction.  If you are a head case, you can reasonably expect your kid to be a head case.  Thank you Dr. Taylor 
 you can really feel throughout her entire first solo album how into it she was and how much care and effort was put into making it the best it could be. in the sweet escape, you feel some of that originality in the tracks, but for the most part- the sweet escape doesnt live up to Lamb.   good standout tracks include: Yummy, wind it up, don't get it twisted, early winter   the second single off of the album will most likely be orange county girl, which in my opinion isnt all that good...  cest la vie- im only giving it 4 stars because pharrell did a great job with beats on the album. 
 This film made me want to travel to Alaska and meet the natives and have a look at them one last time in shame. We don't own this land. This land owns us and if we forget that the human race will vanish very soon. A striking photography and beautiful music will make this film an unforgettable experience. The impact of oil drilling on natives is well explained and very well understood after watching this film. The impact on all of us on the long run becomes quite clear after watching the film. This film is a must see.   
 The book came from England quickly and the dealer emailed me courteously to tell me it had shippe 
 I think it's safe to say that most Americans hold a patent dislike for politics and the general BS that seems to always waft from things 'political.'  Thomas Frank's "What's the Matter with Kansas?..." really does an excellent job of deconstructing just what the heck is going on with contemporary political thought and election-time discourse in our great country.  To boot, Frank does an excellent job of putting the voting decisions of "Middle America" into perspective, giving them a historical context that is entertaining, riveting and rather sobering to be perfectly frank (sorry, couldn't resist).  This book got a 5-star rating from me not because I'm a 'freakin liberal and of course you are going to lap this book up like a $5 latte'... although that does sound pretty good right now.  Before reading this book, I was confused about why the conservative movement in this country was so powerfully seductive to so many people.  I don't mean to offend anyone, but I totally get what Frank is asking:  "Why are people voting conservative when it so clearly runs against their economic interests?"  Why are poor people fighting the unions?  Why did so many people vote Bush in 2004?  How can we be so passionately divided and at odds with each other?  The answers aren't so quick and simple as most conservatives would have you believe and this is why I find Frank's book very persuasive.  He attempts to get at the root (historical, journalistic... he's not an apologist) of what is going on and why people think the way they do.  He is admittedly a progressive, but doesn't let it interfere with the answering of these important questions.  *If you're confused about stuff - buy it and read it.  *If you're conservative and want to know why we're so dang curious about Kansas being a red state - this book might be a little too much on the "bleeding heart" side at times, but you just might learn something.  Perhaps one day we can all sit around a campfire and sing Kumbaya, eat lentils and discuss this book and the cosmos like brothers.  I'll bring the latte 
 I don't know if it's the time in my life or my love for music, but I was moved by this album. Emmylou Harris has been around for a long time and I defenitely get a sense of her musical wisdom through Wrecking Ball. It's got those eerie guitar riffs that make me feel like I'm floating when I listen to it. I'm not a huge fan of country music and always thought of Harris as more along those lines, but this album is mellow, rich, and full of passion. 
 The stories in this book cover just about everything from tales of alligator men to torrid love affairs. They provide a lot of insight into African American culture and history, and are even written in dialect. The forward included in this edition really helped me understand what I was reading when I started the book. Some of the stories are a little confusing though, because they are printed in two different versions in this book. There's a glossary of slang which is also really helpful. I'd reccomend it for anyone who's a fan of folklore or African American history or literature 
 A good grounding in Chronic Fatigue Syndromes with a comprehensive guide into the syndrome. Suitable for medical practitioners and also the general public. I would recommend it Dr Adrian Winbow Consultant Psychiatris 
 If you are only going to own one collection of 10-minute plays, this is the one to own.  The choices are well written, show variety, and are infinitely produceable in small spaces 
 I first read this book when I was in my early twenties. I was amazed. I couldn't put the book down. Reagan's closest family members and friends like to talk about how the President was "distant" and lived in his own world. This book will let you see the real Ronald Reagan and get inside his world. The stories and insider view of Reagan's life and presidency will amaze and inspire you. You will learn the simple values and principles that have made this man one of the most beloved Presidents in recent history. His charm and sunny disposition come radiating from the pages. The book is excellently written and is an interesting read from start to finish.  Do yourself a favor, buy this book and buy a few copies for people that you really care about. Better yet, buy this book AND buy the audio version so that you can hear the words come off the page and alive with the the voice of "The Gipper."   Ronald Reagan Wisdom...  From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? - Ronald Reagan 1981 First Inaugural Speech  I know in my heart that man is good. That what is right will always eventually triumph.  And there's purpose and worth to each and every life.  - Ronald Reagan 
 This was of course a good read, as most all of the 'In Death' books are.  I very much liked the two mysteries that Eve had to solve (the murders and the missing person).  So glad Mavis finally had her baby.  Not a lot of character development...when will something different happen to Eve and Roarke? We need a bit of a toss up with them.  I am a loyal fan and will wait eagerly for the next one 
 A very enlightening account of not only the Jewish experience in Islamic lands, but also of the overall treatment of non-Muslim subjects within Muslim territories. This historical background is essential to the understanding of present relations between Islam and the West, as well as Israel and its surrounding Muslim neighbours. Lewis writes in a style easy to read, and yet still academically rigorous. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to get beyond current media headlines and dwelve deeper into the roots of contemporary unease between the West and Islam. As for Jews like myself who grew up in Muslim countries, it is essential reading 
 No one knows better than Timothy Treadwell, the adventures he faced every day in the wild woods of Alaska.  His deep love for the bears are evident as one reads the pages of this book.  The chances he took with the wild animal are almost beyond description.  It is as if he became one of them, often overstepping his boundaries.   A very interesting book, maybe because it is factual.  It is hard to believe that one might become so consumed by these beautiful but ferocious bears.  His drive to protect them finally became the one thing that brought him to his demise.   It is a great book and well worth the read 
 With all the resources on skiing available on the web, printed guidebooks have almost become obsolete. Resort web sites and ski portals such as DCSki typically provide most of the information found in guidebooks. Web sites also contain up-to-the-minute information on weather and conditions plus timely reviews and firsthand accounts for just about every ski resort on the planet. Finally, many web sites are true communities of practice, places where devotees to snow sports come together and exchange information and ideas.  With that being said, I must confess that I have finally found a guidebook worth purchasing. Where to Ski and Snowboard Worldwide is the ultimate reference for those contemplating a ski trip to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. The book features full length chapters on every major destination resort in Europe plus additional chapters covering major resorts in the rest of the world, including the U.S. and Canada. Within each chapter, a reader will find a general review of the resort; a description of slopes for each ability level; and a guide to accommodations, dining, and aprés ski.  Readers will appreciate the no-nonsense candor of this book. At the beginning of each chapter, the guide provides a 1-5 star rating for various aspects of the resort ranging from slopes to aprés ski, and also a quick list of pluses and minuses for each resort. The authors, for example, give Courchevel lots of stars for snow, slopes, and lifts, but only two stars for charm. In its plus/minus matrix, the authors note that Courchevel has "extensive, varied local terrain to suit everyone from beginners to expert," but then notes in the minus column that the resort is "expensive," and that its villages are "soulless." In short, Where to Ski calls the shots where it sees them, offering both compliments and criticisms for each resort profiled.  Where to Ski also offers a nifty "Mountain Facts" sidebar in each chapter that allows one to quickly compare resorts by benchmarks such as skiable vertical in both meters and feet, number of lifts, and kilometers/miles of trails. There is also a "resort ratings at a glance" section at the beginning of the book that brings together the ratings the book gives to each resort in an easy to read table format. If that were not enough, the book provides 200 resort photos, 125 full color trail maps, 70 scale village plans, and general maps for most of the world's major ski regions.  The major weakness of the guide is that it is very Eurocentric. The majority of the 400 resorts covered in detail are in Europe, primarily in the Alps. The book devotes a mere 38 chapters to resorts in the United States, and only four East Coast resorts receive chapter-length treatment: Killington, Smugglers' Notch, Stowe, and Sunday River. I nearly returned the book when I did not find a single Mid-Atlantic venue listed in the table of contents. Shame on Reuters! How can this book devote a chapter to ski resorts in Romania and not mention the great skiing of West Virginia and Pennsylvania?  On the plus side of the matrix, what the books lacks in its North American coverage, it more than makes up for in its coverage of Europe. Furthermore, the guide does a superb job of comparing skiing on both continents with an introductory chapter entitled, "Transatlantic differences." From it, I learned that few resorts in North America possess skiable vertical greater than 3,330 feet whereas some of the biggest European resorts offer verticals of over 6,600 feet. The large resorts in Europe also dwarf the biggest resorts in North America in terms of ski terrain. On the other hand, it snows much more in North America, and North American resorts have far more advanced and comprehensive snowmaking than anything found in Europe. There are many other differences that this book describes, but you will have to purchase the book to get a complete rundown. 
 I can not laud this book too highly.  It is meticulously researched and intelligently presented.  You will be astounded.  Stunned, maybe.  Did you know that the deadly form of the religion of peace got its start in Boulder, CO?  Can you imagine that the people who were smart enough to bring down the World Trade Center were such superstitious morons that they thought a glucose IV bottle was attracting Soviet bombers?  Well, you will if you read this.  And that's just the start 
 This book explains finance basics with realistic problems instead of giving simple examples which dont make sense in learning the concept. A useful source for students, includes excel and calculator (HP19B)shortcuts for problems 
 This is a great album and worth more than the few bucks I payed for it 
 One of the most inspiring stories of all-time. If you think your life is rough, watch this. Amru Albeirut 
 I have found this book to be very helpful in supporting and dealing with the emotions of my spouse as we go through our IVF journey.  The book really helped me understand the delicate emotions of someone experiencing infertility and how comments like "relax", "stop worrying about it", etc. actually do more harm than help.  As a result, I am much more supportive in this IVF cycles than I have been in other cycles because I changed the focus of my comments and have avoided saying the wrong thing 
 Very nice product, but the mounting screws and holes were too small for my 26" WS LCD.  I had to drill the mounting holes larger and acquire some  screws.  Other than that the item is better than I expected 
 This is a fun toy to have around, especially for boys and men who think they're boys! Better get yours from Amazon.  I have a hunch Toys R Us will sell out quickly.  Here's to the little kid in all of us 
 Well I remember sparkin up and listen with "Yellow Pills" in my headphones. I have not touched weed at all in about 15 years, but I still remember this one. Great vocal work, mix is very tight, I remember taking a very very pretty date with me to the STARWOOD club to see 20/20. Later the owner of the club met with an ill fate due to some sort of mob activity and a related murder, if I remember correctly after all those drugs I did as a teenager. The STARWOOD club was shut down. Somehow I survived anyway and my last 20/20 memory was at UCLA where I was attending as an undergrad when 20/20 played live outside on a perfect bright sunny day. Side note I have seen a review on the net that refered to "Nuclear Boys" as something new wave related when it was obviously political, which the record company objected to as it was about Ronald Reagan. The reviewer (Chris Woodstra) completely missed what that song was about, and it did cause the record company to object strenuously I believe 
 I was just finishing my copy of this book when I saw the authors were quoted on Oprah's show on June 26. I think the authors have lots of great ideas and they obviously have first hand experience. And to see the book and writers quoted on Oprah gave more emphasis to their points. I would recommend this book to anyone who has started or is even remotely thinking about starting an at-home business 
 great book and great artist.  not sure what the person who wrote negative review was comparing it to, but she/he is a freak show who has way too much time on her/his hands. obviously bitter about something...possibly crazy 
 If you were to select a subject for a droll and howlingly funny novel, it is doubtful that the fall of Singapore would be high on your list.  Nevertheless, that's what you have here!  The action centers on the British  expat community who, intent on their usual trivial rounds of partying and  copulating, are completely oblivious to the fact that the Japs are  inexorably creeping down the Malay Peninsula. The novel properly darkens in  tone as the city's situation becomes obviously desperate, but it maintains  its ironic tone throughout.  The result is an absolute masterpiece, and I  don't use that term lightly 
 The Sixties are almost over, it's summer and it's a summer of sex, drugs and rock and roll and at a major Woodstock like rock fest where the Mad Hatters thrill their audience in a show that's going to propel them on their way to stardom. This summer is also the last summer  Linda Lovesworth ever sees. Her body is found close to the festival and since Linda gave up a baby for adoption when she was sixteen, the police conclude she was killed by her lifestyle, but not before Detective Inspector Stanley Chadwick does his level best to try and solve the murder.  Almost four decades later London rock journalist Nicholas Barber is murdered near to Detective Inspector Banks's Yorkshire Precinct. As it turns out Barber had been researching a story about the Mad Hatters just as the band had been planning a reunion tour. Lover of Rock and Roll as he is, Banks finds this a case well suited to him and after a bit he begins to suspect that the murder DI Chadwick was unable to solve might somehow be connected to Barber's murder, especially after he finds out there is just a little too much coincidental tragedy connected to the Mad Hatters. Or course, Banks is the only one to think the cases are connected, but that does not deter the intrepid inspector.  I really enjoyed this book, especially the way Peter Robinson was able do deftly switch between time periods. I never lost interest. It goes without saying that if you're an Inspector Banks fan, this is a must read and if you haven't delved into any of the inspector's cases, this is a good place to start. It may be the fourteenth novel in the series, but it reads like a stand alone. This is a very good book 
 Somewhat dream-like, but not as bizarrely abstract as "Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron."  This is the book that made me a fan of Clowes.  Wonderfully precise graphic style that trumps the look of both "Velvet Glove" and "Ghost World. 
 An excellent historical and scholarly read that provides a detailed history of the Underground Railroad.  The book goes into great depths to document the people that successfully and unsuccessfully escaped slavery as well as those that helped them and those that didn't.  As with any story dealing with historical events there are some parts that are difficult to read through because of their tragedy (how could the barbaric system of American slavery existed such a short time ago?).  However those areas are offset by stories of hope and celebration of those that were successful.  It was interesting to discover what lead to successful passage - some times skill, some times just luck.   A longer read that other books on this subject it was very thorough. Because it's based on real people and real events it's not dry like some historic works. The only suggestion was that this book could have benefited from more pictures, maps, diagrams, etc.  Overall extremely good. 
 Its always been a great moive! I was getting this for my fathers DVD surround sound system so he could here the jets take off! AMAZIN 
 I agree with the other review in that the actual real pictures were extremely helpful yet the depiction of tracts were difficult for me to follow at times.  This is a required text for my neuroanatomy course, and it served a vital purpose.  I like this text and would recommend it to anyone in the field 
 I was looking for books that would help with active games for my daughter's summer birthday party when I ran across this book.  In contrast to many other books which are organized by party theme (dog, princess, superhero, etc.), this book is helpful because it is organized first by age and then by type of activity.  The age ranges are preschool (2-5), school age (6-9) and preteen (10-12).  The activities are grouped by traditional games, contemporary games, group activities, outings and events (which are closer to the theme parties you get in other books) and entertainers.  Each game identifies not just the target range, but how far you can stretch to encompass older kids, the number of players needed, game objective and what materials to have on hand.  It also gives ideas for creative ways to modify the game to fit children's disparate interests or different settings, prizes, favors, and trouble-shooting tips.  We host our children's birthday parties at home (in contrast to many families, which use other locations such as gymnastics centers, pottery facilities, etc.) so I am always looking for activities both to keep kids active, but also to calm them down at the right time.  This book offered ideas for both.  All in all, a very helpful book not just for the upcoming birthday party, but also for future play dates and field trips with my kids.  
 Esta es una obra que sin duda gustara a los fieles lectores de Pérez- Reverte. La historia se desarrolla en el S.XVII y a quienes sean aficionados a la historia o que gusten de introducirse mas aun en las obras que leen, sin duda con esto libro tendran material para investigar. No solo trata el tema sobre el Capitan Diego Alatriste y Tenorio, su paje Iñigo Balboa y los 2 ingleses (además de varios personajes extra que aparecen) sino que toca otros puntos importantes, haciendo que el lector se introduzca en la obra y sea uno de esos libros que pueden leerse y reelerse con el mismo gusto que si fuera la primera vez.  Esta es una obra con un vocabulario probablemente algo fuerte para los mas pequeños, sin embargo lo unico que se busca con el uso del vocabulrio es enfatizar el ya de por si acentuado realismo de la obra.Mi recomendación es que lea con cuidado esta obra y va a quedar satisfecho con esta aventura, y si le gusto también recomiendo que adquiera los siguientes 3 libros de la seri 
 Absolutely beautiful.  Listening to the Carpenters is part of our Christmat tradition 
 Painstakingly compiled and expertly edited by Diane Waggoner (Andrew W. Mellon foundation Curatorial Fellow in the Art Collections at The Huntington), The Beauty Of Life: William Morris & The Art Of Design is specifically devoted to the decorative artwork of William Morris, an influential leader of the British Arts and Crafts movement. Contemplative and informative essays by Pat Kirkham, Gillian Naylor, and Edward R. Bosley are added to those of Diane Waggoner and concern William Morris' diverse works of art (including his stained glass and interior decoration designs). These essays are enhanced with eye-catching, full color photographs. A joy to simply page through and savor, and presented with a deep respect for artistic traditions stretching back to medieval times and beyond, The Beauty Of Life is a superbly presented and heartily endorsed addition to personal, professional, academic, and community library Art History collections 
 I am a bit conflicted over this book. On the one hand I am a great admirer or Jung - he has brought a lot to my life. His writings on and abotu Gnosticism and his Answer to Job are some of the most spiritual-awakening things I have ever read. Yet, this book I just didn't find as enlightening as these other works. Don't misunderstand - I liked it but found myself a little bored at times. However (let the contradictions cease!!) I liked the format of this book as autobiogrpahy more than most of the others I have read. I would recommend this to people who want to know about him and the way he thinks (the way he became enlightende) but I would recommend some of his others book for those looking to be enlightened! Thank 
 Once again, Michele Signorile has put out a collection of articles that express -- clearly, elegantly, wittily and pertinently -- the best thinking on gay issues being thought today. With Larry Kramer and a few others, he has been the voice of sane homosexuality for quite some time, saying things that should long ago not have needed to be said -- but wow! the attention span does seem to get shorter every day. I hope, therefore, that he will continue to say them as often and as copiously as he deems necessary, and for many years to come. I most seriously urge every gay man in America (and elsewhere too) to read him and to LISTEN. He really knows what he is talking about --and there are truly not many men around these days, in any sphere, about whom one can say the same! I do not know him, but I love him. He is a national treasure. Long may he flourish. I eagerly await his every article and his next book. Richard Miller 
 The book covers everything from the basics of setting up a scene with lighting to writing your own shaders with detailed descriptions of the Renderman API.  Overall, excellent overview for the intermediate graphics prefessional 
 I was so happy to finally read the second book from James Ridout. I feel like I know the family after reading his first book "Plantation Secrets" that when I read this book It was like visiting and catching up with old friends.  Thanks - I hope there will be another to follow! 
 This is a wonderful presentation of the original story without the moralisms of Disney's adaptation. There is bad and good luck, cunning, bravery and dealing with tough situations without whining.  This leaves room for children to respond to the story and interpret it. My two year old grandson loved it, even if he didn't know what a churn was. The drawings are stylish. I recommend it as an addition to your basic library of classic children's tales 
 A Bone From a Dry Sea is an overall good book. Allthough some parts were I admit a little boring the book brings up some very important topics. I felt I could relate to the present main charactor Vinny. Li was another question. Even though it was hard to relate to Li, I found the part of the book concerning her to be very interesting. The way Li thought and used trial and error was what kept the book interesting, that and the parts of Vinny getting to know her dad.. 
 In her autobiographical novel, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou recounts her life story as a young, keenly intelligent but insecure black girl in the South during the 1930s and California during the 1940s. The book conveys the difficulties associated with the mixture of racial and gender discrimination endured by a southern black girl, though, and this is perhaps the most fundamental theme explored in her autobiography. The intersectionality of race and gender is a pivotal thread of Angelou's theme, where more than one type of subjugation results in a multiple burden for the victim. Overall, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings is a powerful, stirring account of the intersectionality of race and gender regarding black women. Though segregation had been officially declared null and void, many of the Southern states were steeped in racist tendencies that further multiplied the gender inequality that exposed black women to a multi-faceted oppression. Peiss, Hine, Terborg-Penn, Bederman, et. al. all examine threads of this intersectionality, and in discussing these threads, one can draw a distinct comparison between anti-black, anti-black women sentiment and Angelou's personal experiences. As a girl, Angelou believed her gender to be a limiting factor. She considered herself to be unheroic, and incapable of achieving spectacular feats like the boys in her comic books. In the narrative, being female for Angelou is just as trying as being black, and she struggled with the double burden, rather than embracing it. However, as more and more black women slowly overcame their troubles as a result of the overwhelming intersectionality of the time, so did Angelou. The novel ended with hope because she bucks the stereotype to become the first black female streetcar conductor. Angelou's spike in confidence and belief in her ability reflects the gradual evolution of black women's race and gender after decades of imprisonment, and foreshadows a future of activism, struggle for respect and eventual victory in those regards. 
 'Going Public with Your Faith' is a book worthy of it's title.  The authors lay down the foundational principle concerning evangelism in a fresh and up-to-date way and then give practical steps toward effectively carrying out this commission in the workplace.  I would recommend this book to anyone who - like me -struggles with how to appropriately and effectively take Jesus to work, and who - like me - has often felt guilt associated with the misunderstanding that 'secular work' is somehow inherently less noble than 'full-time ministry' 
 If you have any interest in R. Buckminster Fuller's philosophies, inventions and thoughts, this book is a good starting point.  Other of his works can be more difficult to absorb, easily.  Fuller's basic concepts of "synergy," "ephemeralization" and "modern day pirates" are all made clear here.  If you read this short work and are intrigued by the man and the distinctions he brought to the world, you can proceed from here.  Sorry OMSE is getting difficult to find.  Now that Bucky's "phantom Captain" has moved on, his words are what we have to instruct us -- these, and the wonderful contributions of Bucky's students to the "world game.&quot 
 My mother has introduced numerous authors to me, and I am glad that she has. She has introduced to me to classics, to modern day litature, and some crud books. I learned what to pick from her. I know what to read. When she introduced this book to me, I had no prior knowledge about the author, James Frey. For all I knew, it was a "drug" book. After my mother had finished it, She gave it to me to read. I was skeptical about it. I felt that I could not read it, because it didn't sound intresting. It was a story of a man that defines rock bottom. He wakes up on a plane, covered in body fluids, and has a hole in his cheek which he has no recollection of getting it. He is then taken to a rehababilitation facility, where he detoxs and thinks about life. He then meets love and finds himself there. It is a uplifting story.   Prior to finishing or during the course of my reading it. I found that there were accusations of lying in the story. I was flabbergasted by it. I didn't understand why he would make up stuff in the book, but I got over it and understood that it was a solid story and had solid writing. I felt that the people that blasted it for being fabricated probably read some or none at all of the story. They were probably understandbly upset at his success with the book. I am not blasting them, but they need to open their eyes and read what is in front of them.   Frey's writing stylye is highly unorodox for a writer. He doesn't write in paragraphs or is highly detailed. He just is honest and to the point. He doesn't hold back when he writes. Some people might find the story annoying, but I find it original and it helps showcase the conversations which usually are in "" but not the case in this book. It kind of reminds me of ee cummings and his poetry, but Frey doesn't do the random placement of punctuation. He does get his point, his mood, and his feelings across though.    The conteversy of the book has severly damaged Frey's reputation as a Author. He probably is spit on by the other authors for the fabrications. This society is totally obessed with bringing out ONE key aspect of a person or thing and blowing the whole thing out of poportion. Frey is a solid author that deserves another chance. He possibly has helped millons of people with his book get through whatever they were struggling through. It is a inspiring book, that is, if you take off the goggles thrown on by the conteversy and read the book. 
 If you want a tool belt that works this is the book for you. Dr. Sells provides a step-by-step approach to every possible problem you might encounter and what to do if Plan A doesn't work. He gives you a recipe menu of creative consequences to stop behaviors such as disrespect, running away, violence, drug and alcohol abuse, threats of suicide, and ditching school. The one reviewer who didn't like the book (dirtyh20sam) must have ignored Dr. Sells' warning that if you try to use contracts and it escalates your teen it means that you must seek and outside therapist for help because you either did not follow all the steps correctly or you have underlying family problems like marital conflict or depression that must be addressed. The book works but you have to follow the recommendations correctly 
 This book has some interesting anecdotes on Crows, Ravens & Jays, and it does also describe much of the day to day life of these birds. The book is more than 50% full page photographs, and the photography is excellent. There are a few Brandenburg photos that have the Brandenburg touch, an animal filmed intimately close. But if you are trying to do reseach on animal intelligence, this book is too shallow for that. It glosses over some reseach and incidents that I've read about more thouroughly in other sources. I wanted to say but but there's more... or yes but that has only been observed in two locations. If you are looking for photography and some general knowledge on corvids, this is the book. If you are researching animal intelligence, try George Page  for a solid introduction. I think the title is Animal Minds. And if you already know quite a bit about this subject, you know where to look better than I do 
 I am not a huge fan of contempory Christain music, but I loved this CD.  The word were relevant and easy to understand.  The booklet gave Scripture that the group based the lyrics on.  
 This is the first episode where we really see the heart of Tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father. A must see 
 Wonderful movies, a must have for any fan of TOS or TNG 
 Got these slippers for my man for Christmas. They are buttery soft, the fit is true to size and they are not lined with something to heavy and hot for the feet. Can be worn barefoot or with socks. Great for a quick dash outside. I would recommend these slippers and this seller 
 Timothy M. Renick does a fairly admirable job at explaining Thomas Aquinas and his thought.  He wrestled and explained the often confusing theological issues with surprising clarity.  Now I must admit this book is very basic which serves its purpose admirably.  The best thing about Renick is his analogies are so relevant and well thought out.  There is no doubt he has a skill for engaging and making the reader think.  Some of the comments were a little much, but overall if you would like to know more about Aquinas and don't feel particularly confident starting with the Summa, start right here.  He will explain things so you have a roadmap and a small foundation so you can expand your studies of Thomas.  Just from reading this book I can imagine Renick would be a pretty enjoyable teacher in the classroom.    Thomas was no doubt extremely intelligent and it would be very valuable to study and learn about his thought and influence.  This book could have even been expanded or made it to a two part series in order to cover more of Thomas.  I found the chapters on abortion, politics, and free will to be extremely important and interesting.  
 I got tired of dragging out my trusty box grater to do small jobs like grating nutmeg, ginger or Parmagiana Reggiano so I picked this little gem up. It feels good in your hand (no surprise there...it's what Oxo is known for)is well-made and cleans up beautifully...every time. It is so easy now just to grab this guy and grate what needs to be grated that I find I am using whole spices more and more. Grab yourself one of these...you'll love it 
 As "Mad Collector horror film buff" has noted, Dark Ride is reminiscent of The Funhouse, and should be of special interest to fans of dark rides and carnivals.  (There's even a brief reference to Hide and Shriek, the Our Gang episode that found Alf Alfa and friends in an amusement pier spook house.)  The plot, production values, and special effects are solid, and the acting is very good.  It's not clear to me whether the dark ride sets and animatronics were genuine (borrowed from some amusement park warehouse, I guess) or created for the movie, but they're convincing and quite cool.  My only complaint is that the script is a bit verbose, with more dialogue and exposition than is necessary to establish the back story.  The DVD features are decent and include a "making of" documentary that leaves me with the impression that everyone had a lot of fun making the movie and put a lot of heart and effort into it.  Definitely worth watching if you're a horror film fan, and definitely worth owning if you're a dark ride or carnival buff 
 Simply one of the best dance instruction DVDs I have. John Hill explains things clearly, from different angles, and with a good deal of easy-going all-American charisma befitting Swing.  This DVD has added a lot of nice flourishes to my current repertoire of Swing moves, and I even recently used many of John Hill's techniques that I learned from this DVD at a national ballroom DanceSport competition. These included the Alternating Rock Turns (aka Stop Turns) and Flare kicks. (I did quite well with my dance partner in the competition, most of the time earning first place finishes on our heats.)  I also got a lot out of the chapter on Multiple Turns, including the cool Double Inside Turn. In fact I still have quite a bit to go through on this DVD and it has provided me with hours of learning pleasure.  The bottom line: This DVD is worth the money, not only for the priceless info on it--but its ability to make you smile every time you play it! : 
 I challenge anyone to put up any other Hip Hop legend's first four CDs next to DMX's and they will lose.  The Great Depression was X's fourth classic CD proving that he's the best hip hop artist of all time and the true voice of the streets.  His gritty message, slick revenge narratives, honest spirituality, unrelenting fascination with street ingenuity, all come out on the Great Depression.  His piece about his grandmother was touching.  Everyone knows that Who WE Be is the greatest Thug narrative ever written.  DMX is the best Hip Hop artist of all time and I challenge anyone to show me four CDs that can compare to his first 4.  This is not to say that I didn't like his 5th effort but he was a victim of his own success and so Grand Champion wasn't a classic like the first four so everyone was hating on him.  But still it was tight.  The Great Depression was his last classic CD.  Grand Champ had a lot of anger and frustration but this time without the ingenuity and creativity you saw on the first 4 
 In this novel we have the characters we have come to love. The writing is tighter and the plot clear. Not quite as exciting or fresh. Some further development with Leah happens which I won't reveal 
 Okay, stranger things probably did happen in real-life besides enemies  exchanging vital resources while continuing their fight. However, the  motive supplied for the Hagannah's violent intervention was unjustified,  potential of failure high with great risks of exposure.  Secrecy was the  key to the success of the Tortugas players (ie, to get what they wanted and  avoid being exposed for dealing with the enemy).  All the Haganah needed to  have done was make some public exposure, or even give just a hint to make  things hot for the players and all Tortugas players would be stopped cold.   The rest of the book was okay, fast moving and the action sequences rather  lame. That David Spaulding led such a charmed life that his life was  continually spared while Ed Pace was snuffed out was rather hard to  swallow.  Furthermore, no explanation was given about Leslie's mention of  Bonner 
 I purchased one of the Casio Men's Atomic Waveceptor Yellow Dial Watch #VQ200HDA-9BVCF from amazon. This watch is great, it updates the time automatically (just switched to daylight savings and I didn't have to touch a thing).Instructions say to position watch in a window or where it has view to the sky for updates, My watch was in a drawer under a marble top and it updated just fine.I saw in other reviews complaints about the plastic back, this is a must to allow the auto updates. Again, Cool Looking,Great Watch!!!!   
 I have always been interested in learning how things work.  This book was a wealth of information on the technical aspects of the making of this TV production.  All the way from casting to the final wrapup it provides that behind-the-scenes insight which is not available to the general public.  I was satisfied with the depth of information given, just enough to make me understand but not so much that I got lost in the technical language.  After reading the book I went back and watched the series again and was amazed at how much more I noticed and appreciated.  I highly recommend this book to any true Pride and Prejudice fanatic 
 Even if he never wrote anything else, Harold Arlen earned a stellar position in the Great American Songbook for writing "Over the Rainbow", as well as the other songs from "The Wizard of Oz".  But he wrote so many more wonderful songs, ranging from the happiest and most light-hearted melodies to songs of nearly-operatic power.  Sopranos, in particular, should look at this collection, which contains "Blues in the Night", "I Had Myself a True Love", and "I Wonder What Became of Me".  The arrangements in this book are quite full, although a professional accompanist could make more of them, and the keys are singable.  It is one of the staples of my popular music library.  Harold Arlen's work is often associated with Judy Garland, but I think Eileen Farrell is actually the absolute best interpreter of his songs.  Look for her CDs titled "Eileen Farrell Sings Harold Arlen" and "I Got a Right to Sing the Blues".  They will blow you away, and maybe change your perception of what great singing can be 
 While those who did NOT read book 4 might be puzzled, the film still holds great magic for the rest of us.  The telling of the tale, complex and dark, is handled well.  The special effects were excellent, the character growth wonderful and true.  How this will play out in future editions and movies is part of the magic of this series 
 One of the challenges in new product innovation is that the process cannot be broken down into a simple sequence of steps. "Follow these six steps" is not advice that will lead to the breakthrough thinking and innovative ideas that lead to best-selling new products or enhancements to existing products.   "Innovation Games" acknowledges that innovation and creativity do not come from following a predefined sequence of steps but from pushing ourselves to thinking about products, users, and usage scenarios in different ways. One of my favorite techniques from this book is the idea of thinking of a product or service as a speed boat with an assortment of attached anchors, each representing something that a customer doesn't like about the product or service.  Playing the games described in this book will almost certainly lead you to better and more innovative product ideas.  
 This is Hemingway's classic, quasi-autobiographical tale of love and war set in northern Italy during WWI.  Many of the events and characters in this story parallel the real life of EH himself.  Like the author, the main character of this story, Frederic Henry, is an American volunteer ambulance driver taking wounded Italian soldiers from the front line to field stations and then to hospitals in the rear.  During the course of his duties, he falls in love with a British nurse.  The story relates how they try to pursue and develop their relationship with all the turbulent events of the war surrounding and buffetting them.  This is probably the novel that best defines EH as an author, and while a very good tale, is probably not his best novel.  In particular, this story is not nearly as rich nor as well developed as `For Whom the Bell Tolls' (my personal EH favorite).  Most of the text is dialogue between the characters who speak in a terse, direct prose (i.e. the typical Hemingway style).  There are quite a few unexpected twists and turns in the plot, and I must admit that I was surprised by the ending.  Like Robert Jordan in `For Whom the Bell Tolls', the role of Henry as a volunteer allows him to question (really as an outside observer) his relationship with the military and the cause he is fighting for as he is not fighting for patriotism or nationalism.  This is definitely worth buying and reading if you have any interest in American literature.  Unlike many so-called literary `classics', this novel is neither ponderous, obtuse, nor unnecessarily long.  It is an easy, enjoyable read.  If you are new to EH, I would recommend that you either start with this novel or some of his short stories.  If you've already read some other EH works and enjoyed them, you will almost certainly be pleased with this one.  The Scribner hardcover edition is a few dollars more than the paperback, but certainly worth the few extra pennies if you plan to keep the book as part of a collection 
 GREAT BOOK... I COOK THESE MEALS FOR MY BOYFRIEND WHO IS A MEAT AND POTATO GUY AND HE LOVES THEM. THE BEST VEGETARIAN COOKBOOK I HAVE EVER USED. THIS AUTHOR REALLY KNOWS HOW TO BLEND THE SPICES TO MAKE GOURMET MEALS IN MINUTES. I WAS ABLE TO BUY MOST OF THE INGREDIENT AT SAFEWAY OR IN THE BULK BINS AT WHOLE FOODS. THIS BOOK HAS REALLY SAVED ME A TON OF TIME AND MONEY. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT... 5 STARS!! 
 I am finding this book interesting, especially the analyses of how sex dictates nearly everything we do as humans, and how we are not so different in our biological motivations from other animals. Definitley recommend it for someone interested in trying to understand why we do what we do, and how to be aware of our own behavior 
 I found the book to be very informative and was impressed with the recipes Jane presented. She show a through knowledge of the subject and continues to show her cooking skills 
 In Directing Film, film director Ken Russell shares his knowledge of the director's art and job from analyzing a script to making scenes and choosing images. Black and white film shots accompany a guide which comments on differences between plays and films, reveals the director's role in shooting a screenplay, and considers the requirements of the camera. Plenty of examples and first-person insights pack this presentation 
 I came across the Immortal Yi Soon Shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels. Up to this time I had never heard of it, but immediately I was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing. As I continued to watch (it had English subtitles fortunately) I became enthralled by the acting, plot and historical theme. With a little detective work, I learned that I had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes. I told my wife how good it was, and after we watched an episode together, she and I both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it. We managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television. Nearly every episode was better than 90% of the Hollywood movies out there. If you like, action, drama, amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors, intersting history, and some of the best writing I have seen on television, or anywhere for that matter, check this out 
 As of 2006, ColdPlay's X&Y stands as one of the best albums of the 21st century to date. This album just rings with the sound of a classic album. If "Speed of Sound" and "Talk" wasn't enough to make it great, "What If" and "Fix You" put this album in a class with The Joshua Tree, The Wall, etc. for shear greatness. The songs throughout are anthemic. Coldplay's live shows are an amazing experience. Don't hesitate on this one, it's a "must have" 
 When I began to read this book I was instantly draw to the character's in it. Ms. Roberts has a way of making the  character's seems so realistic. You will probably find yourself saying, "I know someone that is just like that!" I absolutley love the one named "Ripley!" If you are debating on buying this book I would definately say, YES! Don't forget the other two books that go along with this one. Each book tells the story of all three witch's. All are very enjoyable to read 
 My anthropology professor at Western Michigan University assigned this book.  Of the books she assigned, this is the only one I read cover to cover.  Nisa sounds like a formidable, admirable woman, one I'd like to meet and to hear speak.  She's got wonderful tales to tell.  If you're into women's studies, anthropology, or just enjoy things like educational television about various cultures around this magnificent world of ours, you will enjoy this book.  If, however, you don't enjoy reading about sexual progression and/or experimentation in primitive cultures, this book may be a bit much for you 
 Okay, if you are over the age of 3 you may find this book beneath you.  But, wasn't that the intent of the author?  To put together a simple but sweet book that would keep the attention, and even entertain our beginning  readers? Well, he did just that!  My 21-month-old boy just adores this book  and wants it read to him again, and again, and again, and again! It is a  great way to introduce our young ones to the wonderful world of reading.  This book has my vote for baby's best friend 
 Si eres un fan de la serie de Harry Potter y has leido los primeros 5 libros, no hay forma de que te puedas perder este! (Si no has leido los primeros, leelos y luego lee este) Durante el 6to año de Harry Potter en Hogwarts, el niño que vivió sigue enfrentandose a las peores pesadillas de la mayoría de los magos. Mientras que todos estan asustados por la posibilidad de que regrese Voldemort, Harry tiene que enfrentarse una vez más a...  Lee el libro, es asombroso! No voy a decir más sobre este libro 
 I am familiar with pivot tables, but bought this book to enable me to hit the ground running at my new job that requires pivot table skills. The book was very easy to follow, unlike many Excel how-to books, and there are plenty of screen shots to check your progress.  I would recommend this book to those in similar situations to mine, but it does not seem appropriate for those who have consirable experience with pivot tables 
 I didn't have high expectations for this program but I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though my handwriting was sloppy and often ran uphill, the software recognized the overwhelming majority of words.  I could easily correct those it didn't.  It also seemed to learn words that were unfamiliar to it such as "ePortfolio".  After I corrected that word twice it recognized it in subsequent pages.  It has a setting for object recognition as well. For the price, I was glad I bought it 
 I have previously read every book that a fellow West Virginia Native by the name of Pearl Buck, Pulitzer Prize Winner, wrote concerning China.  I was very impressed by the accuracy that Lisa See utilized in her descriptions of concubines, status of family members, arrangement of marriages, and especially foot binding.  I have seen documentaries of elder chinese women severly maimed by this practice. I highly recommend this book to all women and men alike.  It is beautifully written...can't wait for Ms. See's next book 
 I'm listening to this album right now and feel compelled to talk to someone about it. I know it well, I've had it since the original release, but each time I listen to it is a fresh gut punch. It's astonishing, amazing, unbelievable. Look at the album cover photograph. Scary? Not even half of it. Every song sends a chill down your spine, not least because Cash -- recording here near the end of his life -- makes every word so convincing.   From time to time I will hear a piece of music, see a painting or a sculpture, or read a story or essay, and it will be so utterly perfect that I'll think, "this is it, this is all we'll ever need, there is no reason for anyone to compose/write/paint again." This album is like that. Why would anyone ever bother to write or sing another song?  There are only two songs here you might have heard before, "Bird on a Wire" and "Tennessee Stud," but you've never heard them like this. That Johnny Cash makes a Leonard Cohen song sound like a Johnny Cash song may be all you need to know about this record.   You have a sense that this recording is part confession, part prayer, but it's also an artist at the height of his power. Not surprisingly, Johnny Cash is that rare artist who can only get better. Too bad he didn't live to be 100.  If you're not sure whether or not you want this, find a way to hear the first cut, "Delia's Gone." That pretty much sets the tone. If you don't like it, you won't like this album. If you do, well, all 13 cuts have that kind of impact.  I don't know if there's a God, but if I ever meet him, I'm going to thank him for Johnny Cash 
 As a future teacher, I am always looking for books that will be both enjoyable and educational.  This is a great book for social studies concepts in younger grades (K-2) and excellent for elements of literature in older grades (3+).  The message is one that children can never hear enough: You have gifts that should not be neglected 
 Dead Can Dance's music has managed to survive after the group's death. In spite of belonging to a different time and century, it still retains the same spirit it had back when we first heard them. This compilation of the best of their work can only be blamed for the same problem that most compilations have: it does not have enough space to house all the great work they recorded. But it allows newcomers into their music to get a feel for their medieval-meets-ethnic approach, and realize what they've been missing. Past that point, there is no resort but going back and getting their entire catalog. Long live Dead Can Dance 
 For whatever the reason, A Woman of Substance by Barbara Taylor Bradford, was one of those books which always eluded me.  Trying to read it on three separate occasions I never got any further  than 200 pages.  But this year when my online a book list decided to read this, I was determined to persevere or as Emma Harte, the heroine of the book said at the end, "To endure" till I finished the last page.  And finish it I did and found myself falling in love with not only the characters portrayed in this book but with the areas of England Ms. Bradford describes as well.  There are books we all read who give us characters we will never forget.  Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind, Father Ralph and Meggie from The Thorn Birds, Ari Ben Canaan and Kitty from Exodus.  And to this list I now add the name Emma Harte.   A Woman of Substance is a grand book told over close to six decades and also introduces us to the Yorkshire area of England as well as the cities of Leeds and London.  And as if that wasn't enough we come to know dear friends of Emma's like Blackie and the Kallinski family as well as enemies and rivals from the Fairley family.  We also come to know Emmas brothers Frank and Winston and her children and grandchildren.  Emma, through great business acumen and the will to succeed, rises from a maid in a wealthy home to own a multimillion dollar enterprise.  She does this to reap revenge on her former employer and his son, two men who have little understanding of their actions and the consequences.  As Emma becomes more and more successful she finds herself marrying several men but only one does she love with all her heart.    If you enjoyed books like The Tea Rose by Jennifer Donnelly and As the Crow Flies by Jeffrey Archer, I highly suggest you read this oldie and keeper of a book.  I now look forward to read the next book in this series Hold That Dream and the rest including the newest one, Unexpected Blessing, which was just published.  
 I don't give 5 stars out often but I had to here. What I love most about 3rd Force and this album in particular, is that the moods of the songs are extracted from the simple yet catchy bass melody thats hidden just beneath the surface. Try "Gotta Be Real" my personal favorite. This Band really opened my ears to smooth Jazz. I had heard "Gotta Be Real" while channel surfing one day and was so impressed by the melody and smooth sound I decided I had to buy this CD. (A big move considering I listen to hard rock!) Since buying this CD I've been hooked on Smooth Jazz, especially 3rd Force as I now have all of their albums. This album remains one of my all time favorites 
 Although the Artificial Silk Girl (das kunstseidene Mädchen) is the story of a young woman in Germany during the 1920s, I feel as though this story could have taken place today.  I believe that many young readers, who are dissatisfied with the choices we are given, will feel the same way and will be sympathetic to the protagonist's plight.    Doris has become disenchanted with life.  She is unwilling to accept the dichotomous life that everyone expects her to follow: either become a mother or a whore.  However, as Doris discovers, there is little difference between the two.  Doris wants to become a "shine" ("Glanz") and chooses to leave her life as a wage-slave, moving to Berlin and ignoring the restictive choices forced upon her.  The Artificial Silk Girl is written through the eyes of Doris as she describes this period of her life in her "Hollywood movie style."  The reader travels with Doris through her physical and emotional struggles and journeys.  If you are dissatisfied with the choices forced upon us, read The Artificial Silk Girl--not for its answers, but for its familiarity 
 This book is definitely a must for the general population, but we all know they will jsut forget about after they watch 50 hours of TV a week and drive around in their expensive BMW. So I'll cut to the chase. This book is what is needed and it brings up numerous points about the general laziness of society and the bad influence it is.  And a week after I finished this book, what the author was really trying to say hit me. Read this book if you value your sanity and want to truly have a glimpse into how bad the world is. It confirmed all of my thoughts on the problems of the world. Well worth the time to read it 
 This is a great business book, that needs to be in your business collection.  It has many ideas that you can start implementing in your life right away 
 I can't imagine trying to plan a wedding on a tight budget without some type of guide book, and this is the one for me!  SO many great ideas, easy to read, time-lines, do' & don'ts....I say this book is indispensible! 
 In this intriguing study, bestselling author Jeffrey Kottler provides insightful and surprising answers to questions such as: Why do we cry? How are tears interpreted in different cultures? When is crying therapeutic and  when does it become self-destructive? This text challenges conventional  attitudes toward tears and shows how valuable they can be 
 the bad boy family are great but dis album just makes it even bette 
 While The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a timeless tale that has endured the ages and countless retellings from Disney to Tim Burton, the original work contains a rather large error in tone - a blatant one. The story is told in third person as though it's a journal - the sketch book of Diedrich Knickerbocker, in fact. This is fine, except for the climax scene in which Ichabod journeys home through the hollow from Van Tassel's house, and is confronted by the Headless Horseman. This scene is written with all the detailed minutia that characterizes Irving's style, but the obvious problem is that, of course, nobody was there to witness what happened to Ichabod Crane while he was alone in the wilderness, so therefore it could not possibly be communicated by means of somebody's journal - this person would never have known what actually happened in the Hollow since nobody was there to witness it, and apparently Ichabod never survived or stuck around to tell anyone. Irving never deals with this obvious problem in the text (a simple "This is what we think happened..." would've sufficed). The story probably would've worked much better with a traditional "God-perspective" narrator rather than a fictional character's journal. It is nonetheless, a classic work of American literature and should be read by everyone.   This is a fine edition and also includes Rip Van Winkle, another story of paranormal experience and also of the Knickerbocker sketch book. It's a similar tone to Sleepy Hollow, but the characters aren't as memorable 
 Fantastic book!  Templeton uses the business parable style to truly delve into building relationships that become profitable.  A truly great piece of literature for the beginning entrepreneur.  Open this book and build more relationships to build your business 
 I like to watch anything by the group and this one is great.  It has some good stories by each of the performers.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to be cheered up 
 A number of reviewers have complained about this book saying that it really wouldn't happen this way, that the twists and turns of the plot which is a staple with Mr. Deaver are too far fetched to believe.   Well of course it is not believable. The police are not going to go to an outsider for forensic work unless it is with one of the big well known firms who will give them credibility when it comes to court. A working detective with the police department who discovers dirty cops is going to be hated throughout the department. Need I go on?   The answer is, BUT SO WHAT.   Here is a well told, if somewhat familar, tale about a detective, his sidekick, a serial murderer, a truly evil bad guy, twists and turns aplenty,and an overall very enjoyable read. I'd suggest that you read all the Lincoln Rhyme novels in the sequence they were published. The characters do grow and change somewhat as the books progress. Still, each of his books stands alone as a pretty good way to spend a cold weekend or a long airplane flight 
 I'm extremely picky about my fragrance and had worn the same fragrance for 25 years.  I received a sample of this and immediately loved it.  Now I'm an addict.  I use the fragrance, lotion, and body wash 
 _Dear Papa, Dear Hotch_ is a triumph of precise editing: of scrupulous annotations that make this record of the final years of a great American writer come to life. The reader goes along effortlessly, instructed as necessary in diverse particulars-baseball trivia, the names of well-known trapshooters (!), the identities of guests at long forgotten gatherings, advertising slogans, specs for aircraft, Hemingway's confusion of a story by James Thurber with one by Ring Lardner. Those who have ever tried to run down one such datum will appreciate the scholarship, variousness, exactness, and energy of Albert J. DeFazio in presenting this collection.   The 161 letters here were written in the final dozen years of Hemingway's life, in his decline, after he, arguably the most famous writer living, had said what he had to say. As such they make for increasingly sad reading. We see Hemingway's effort to recapture the vitality and tragic dignity that make at least two of his novels and several dozen short stories key documents in American literature and in American self-concept. The letters from A. E. Hotchner-at once a slick, opportunistic sycophant, a cheerfully dutiful factotum, willing to do whatever the once great man asks, and a competent adaptor of original work-do not brighten the picture, nor is it always easy to read "Hotch's" imitations of Hemingway's deliberately scabrous language ("Goddam but I'm glad about the [Nobel] prize," etc.) Sometimes the interplay between them has a sick fascination, "Hemingstein" trying to persuade himself "Everybody will be okay" and "Krotchner" feeding this illusion. One comes to the notes with a sense of relief. They are the real gen.  A six page appendix, in which Hemingway objects to Hotchner's proposed deletions in _The Dangerous Summer,_ reveals more about the drift of Hemingway's writing practices than anything else I have read on the topic 
 Although this book is more difficult to read than other books on depression that I have read, it is worth the extra effort.  It reads like a sociology textbook, which is both good and bad.  It is good in the sense that I have not seen any other books on this topic that so thoroughly  describes depression in general terms but also has a personal touch,  through the interviews.  But the fact that this was a research project (at  least parts of it were) for the author is evident by the writing style 
 Jerry Spinelli's autobiography is interesting and funny. He takes the reader back to the magical days of his childhood. He was a runner and a sports player. He was the perfectionist who colored inside the lines. He didn't like to read regular books but loved comic books and the sports section in the newspaper. He holds the reader's attention with his attention to detail. While reading about his neighborhood and life, the reader becomes well aware that many of these details are what he uses when he writes his books. If you're lucky, his descriptions remind you of that time in your life when you were young and the most important thing at the moment was watching a turtle cross the road. A well-written, engaging account that middle grade students will be able to relate to. Students should find interest in the fact that much of Spinelli's writing success comes from using the memories of his childhood. The only criticism is with the book's title and cover. Students might need to look beyond these two unexciting items to get started 
 I had read Ribofunk 5 years or so ago and enjoyed it and reread it this summer and enjoyed it even more.  When it was finished I wanted more so I sought out The Steampunk Trilogy.  The book was engaging and funny from the very start.  Very, very clever language and style and very funny.  I was particularly impressed with the life the author bestowed upon the many historical people who were incorporated into the story.  After reading the books I even discovered that the Hottentots Venus' pickled "friend" is indeed at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris.  As a New Englander I also loved the fact that two of the stories take place in Massachusetts.  When will you be in Snipe Harbour again, Paul Di Filippo 
 I first learned of this book at a Sunday School convention. I was walking through the hallways looking for a class to attend during the workshop seesion. As I passed John Walsh's class I found it to be the only classroom in the building packed to standing room only. I had to find out what the attraction was in this class, so I came early to the next session to get a seat. Well- I found out why his class was packed. The material in this book covers just about everything John taught in the classes I attended. It will help you learn to tell a story without memorizing it. It is a great way to review the class material and will benefit anyone who wants to improve their storytelling skills 
 A year ago, I was forced to read this book by my english teacher... At first, looking at the cover, (it was red with a picture of a girl) I had an impression that i would not enjoy reading it...   After a couple of days, i was surprised to see myself bringing the book everywhere I go... During break times, lunch, and spend 2 full hours reading it at home...  Reading this diary, made me picture how Anne had her teenage life.. It was really different from mine. Nothing beats how a 13 year old girl manage to live a life like a prisoner in the attic. No other friends to talk too... Same people she sees every single day... In a small place called the "Secret Annexe".   Can you imagine that that kind of life? That you have no idea if you can eat or not, if you should talk or remain silent for the whole day... or if you can still get out of that Annex and live a normal life again... Can you imagine??? But still, they remained hopeful until the last air they breathe...  For me, those people are the real heroes. They never gave up. They sacrificed and united. And best of all, their faith in God reamined strong.  This book influenced millions and millions of people from all over the world. This is a real story of a real world... And the fact that this happens too to so many people. Sometimes we ask, "Why do we need to repeat History?"   Read this book and you'll realize that this is different, worth it and remarkable... 
 I bought this book expecting to read the usual stuff about why some people think that the moon landing was a hoax and how astrology doesnt really work (as explained on the cover). But i was suprised to learn about so many things that I actually thought really did exist in the world of astronomy. I really did think that the water spun in a different direction in australia, and that the sky was blue because thats what a lot of oxygen looks like and many other things that turned out not to be true. Many times i thought "oh what! that isnt real!?"  There is also a nice section that takes delivers a blow to the creationists and their wacko claims.  I highly reccomend this book to anyone curious about astronomy and anyone that wishes to learn about all the ailment of bad astronomy that you never knew you suffered from. 
 This little book - the size is perfect for a purse - was indispensible in Paris.  I don't speak French but this guide book let us be confident about what we were ordering without hesitation.  It was often borrowed by people at other tables who were having a difficult time.  Loved the little "handwritten" notations in the margins 
 It seems Carol Rose went through every culture to collect all the entries. Its very hard, these days, to find good resource materials for mythological beings but this book has it all. No fairy tale aspects, just facts:) Definetly recommended for the fantasy writer or fantasy fanatic 
 If you are looking for a system architecting self-help cookbook, this probably isn't your silver bullet.  A better recommendation might be something like an architecture framework standard (DoDAF, TOGAF, MoDAF, etc.) combined with software system architecting pragmatics, a good text on decision theory, a book on how people actually make decisions (e.g., Sources of Power, Organizational Culture and Leadership), and access to a repository of system architectures.  Although this book has an appendix on heuristics, I doubt that those 12 pages alone would be worth the cost. This book will probably disappoint software-only system architects since much of the book is devoted to the issues of software/hardware co-development and manufacturing systems.   However, if you have questions as a practitioner of systems architecting about your overall architecting approach then I would highly recommend this text.  I would also recommend this as a reference book for a systems architecting class at the advanced graduate level.  This book will probably have little value to those who are not current practitioners.  It does provide a balanced view of the discipline for journeymen.  This view is presented in multiple dimensions such as builder-architected, enabling system (manufacturing), and systems science (social systems) domains.      The chapters on models and modeling is a high-level discussion.  The architecture frameworks chapter is becoming outdated and is quite shallow.  The integrated modeling methodologies (Hatley-Pirbhai, Q2FD) discussion is too short to be of much use other than to lead you to references for further reading.  The section on the systems architecting profession is entertaining but not personally convincing.  However it does cause the reader to think about the profession--an important subject to cover.    The system architecting profession is still in its infancy. This book provides a critical element to that profession's maturation since it identifies some of the domain's critical attributes. The book cannot go into much detail because it would rapidly grow into an encyclopedia-sized tome.  Understanding this text requires a system architecting background to apply what is being presented. Architecting process mechanics is not its subject of focus but rather the overall architecting approach using systems architecting heuristics.  These heuristics (or memes) must be understood from the standpoint of experience in order to be truly effective, and employing those memes without some expertise is truly without merit.  
 Hardy's delicate, plaintive singing always renders her work immediately recognisable, even if she works in many different musical styles. "Et si je m'en..." is a real little gem, her traditional melancholy soaking in a very relaxed country vibe. The songs are pretty, the arrangements simple and beautifully articulated, and the overall feel is that of an artist inviting you to enjoy the luxuriant intimacy of her music. It's hard to pick standout tracks as the album flows so well, but "Pardon", "Cafard" and "Bowm Bowm Bowm" immediately capture attention with their gorgeous instrumentation. A truly lovely album 
 Hey you, if you love & understand the essence of music I would say go get this one, and if its not upto your mark send me the world's most abusive email and I would accept it happily. Music for a person who has a ear and stomach for rhythm(i.e music), and is not merely content with listening to it but is also visualising and absorbing everything that he hears and feels 
 A book which has achieved more notoriety for its sex scenes (shocking in 1930, when the book was written) than for its character studies, Lady Chatterley's Lover focuses on the affair between Constance, the "sturdy" young wife of Clifford Chatterley, and the gamekeeper of the Chatterleys' estate in the remote midlands.  Constance, who married Clifford a month before he left for World War I, has become his caretaker since his return from the war, paralyzed from the waist down and impotent.  A writer who surrounds himself with intellectual friends, Clifford regards Connie as his hostess and caregiver and does not understand her abject yearning for some life of her own.  The distance between Constance and Clifford increases when Mrs. Bolton, a widow from the village, becomes his devoted caretaker, and he becomes increasingly dependent upon her.  In a remarkable scene, Clifford finally tells Connie that he'd like an heir, and he does not care whom she finds to be the father of "his" child.  He believes, in fact, that he could treat her affair as if it were a trip to the dentist.  Connie, yearning for an emotional closeness which she has never experienced before, soon becomes involved with Mellors, the estate's gamekeeper.  Crude and anti-social, Mellors has an honesty and lack of pretension which Connie finds refreshing.    Throughout the novel, Lawrence creates finely drawn characters whose interactions and gradual changes are explored microscopically.  The growth of love between Connie and Mellors is complicated by the increasing self-centeredness of Clifford, whose outrage at rumors of their affair is motivated by Connie's choice of someone so far beneath her.  To Clifford, the separation of the social classes is an integral and inevitable part of life.  Devoted to achieving financial success even at the expense of his workers, the paralyzed Clifford is depicted as a symbol of unfeeling aristocracy and government.  Mellors, by contrast, is vigorous and full of life, a strong man of character who obeys his instincts and stands up for what he believes.  Dealing with themes of love, passion, respect, honor, and the need for understanding, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a complex, character-driven novel which, though dated, celebrates the driving passions which can make life worth living.  The romantic scenes and language here are tame by modern standards, and the extreme behavior and willingness to flout convention by Connie and Mellors may be less realistic, psychologically, than what would make sense to a modern reader.  Firmly rooted in the 1930's, the novel shows an insensitive Clifford adhering to  outdated values, based on outdated economic structures, while Connie and Mellors, freed from these conventions, explore their inner natures and their humanity. n Mary Whipple  
 Judging from the comment made by DISAPPOINTED "N/A", it's obvious that he/she hasn't really listened much to flamenco and understood the traditional roots of the art form. If you're expecting flashy or jazzy solo guitar then forget it. But this is where flamenco started, ie. cante or singing. The live capture of cante is great and I see no reason why this should be rated poorly if people appreciate flamenco 'song' instead of focussing on flashy show-offs 
 When I see young women who don't trust their gut feelings, who don't envision their full potential, who allow abuse, who lack self-confidence, I WISH THEY WOULD READ "Women Who Run With Wolves."  This is not an "easy read," but DO READ IT and become a powerful woman on the inside -- a woman whose soul is steady and strong -- a "Wild Woman."  The author of this book taught me the wisdom and lessons of ancient "fairy tales."  This author taught me to strengthen my core, my soul, trust my own wisdom, listen to myself and stand tall and firm and strong.   This book helped me get over mistakes of the past, and prevent many future mistakes.  Re-reading it always gives me strength and courage and builds my self-confidence.  Also, today, as an "Old Woman" I cannot stand by and quietly watch young women lose their souls.  I must "teach" in a quiet, kind, gentle way.  And, recommend this book !!   I hope you love it, as I did and do.  
 Gregory, a young goat, likes junk food - all the stuff his parents don't want him to eat.  They try everything, taking him to the doctor and even letting him stuff himself with junk food and getting a belly-ache from it.  How can they get Gregory to stop eating carrots and eggs and salad and start eating proper, healthy food - like shirts and shoes and tires??    Kids will laugh at the backwards problem in the book and the illustrations, while not superb, ARE very funny.  Added bonus, of course, is the message about eating balanced meals, always a hard sell to french fry fans 
 If you are new to accounting then this book should definitely be on your list.  Explaining step by step how to record basic journal entries and how these entries relate to the various financial statements (Income Statement, Cash-Flows...), in a clear and well organized fashion.  The only reason I am unwilling to rate this book five stars is due to the price; as most people will be using this book as an introduction to financial accounting it does seem a little expensive.  It is also worth noting the problems and examples used throughout the book are of excellent quality, especially the financial statements provided in appendix A and B.  If you have previous experience within the accounting field I would probably recommend a book at a higher level but beginners could do no better 
 This is one of my favorite child-time horror movies. First of all, who doesn't love dolls, and I don't mean regular ordinary dolls, I mean all kinds of dolls. These aren't just for girls, either. We have soldiers, Mr. punch, teddy bears... it's a free for all killing spree on the wicked people who just had to go and grow up.   I bought and rewatched this movie after years and more years, and it was still great! I laughed, I cringed, I smiled in the end 
  "Children of Paradise" is set in pre 1840 Paris, on Boulevard of Crime and is a richly entertaining and intensely romantic. It is the story of infatuation, jealousy, deception, grief, murder, and true love lost forever. The film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named Garance (unforgettably played by Arletty who was over 40 and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age) and four men who love her - the famous mime Baptist (Jean-Louis Barrault is matchless), the actor, Frederick LeMaitre, the criminal Pierre-François Lacenaire, and the aristocrat Comte de Montray. She loved one of them and the affair was doomed. The film is so much more than just a romantic story (which is absolutely beautiful and compelling) - it is a love song to the Art of Theater where art imitates life and vice-versa and the hidden symbolism of freedom and despotism (the film was made in Paris during the Nazi Occupation under immensely difficult circumstances).   Jacques Prevert wrote the brilliant and ironic scenario and dialog; Marcel Carne superbly directed the film. Its larger than life and gloriously three-dimensional characters, narrative skill and the sweep of production make it a true cinema triumph. It is a 190 minutes long film but I cherished every minute of it.   
 As one would expect from an Agatha Christie novel, "Death on the Nile" is a fast-paced, intricately plotted mystery.  With a wide cast of characters, Christie plumbs the depths of mystery writing standards, using red herrings that not only confuse the characters but confound the reader as well.  "Death on the Nile" is a superb example of a crime so simple that it might just be too difficult to figure out...or is it?  When the reader first meets Linnet Ridgeway, she has everything - beauty, brains, money, and soon enough, her best friend's fiance, Simon Doyle.  The newly married couple embark upon their honeymoon, only to discover the jilted fiance/friend, Jacqueline, seeking revenge at every turn.  When Linnet Doyle is found murdered aboard the 'S.S. Karnak', Jacqueline is immediately the primary suspect, but she has a concrete alibi.  Hercule Poirot must use his somewhat maddening powers of deduction and observation, to piece together the clues with the murder, and the other killings that quickly follow suit.  All on board are suspects with many who have secrets they wish to keep hidden.  Can Hercule Poirot tighten the net and capture the killer before he/she strikes again?  But of course he can, showing off the entire time, and taking readers for a confounding story of alibis and lies, coverups and misleading clues, that comes full circle in the end.  "Death on the Nile" is an extremely well-written mystery that will leave readers guessing until the very last pages when Poirot finally unveils his knowledge of the murderer.  It is by far one of Agatha Christie's greatest mysteries and a timeless classic example of what a good mystery should be 
 I found the book well written, easy to read and follow and packed with a lot of good information.  I used the book to help respond to a proposal for IT risk management.  I used a lot of information from the book to help write our response to the proposal.  The author does a good job of explaining the process and procedures for a sound organizational risk management program.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to start a risk management program at their company 
 Everyone who plays this game says the same thing: It is a masterpiece, it is intriguing, and it is fun.  There's a palatable depth to the game, too, that opens up after a few sittings.  And it's quick and simple to setup - you can turn off the TV and play a round before bed.    If you were to be critical of the game, two things stand out.  The playing cards are not laminated, which could be taken as a lack of quality in construction.  And the exploration theme of the game is mostly irrelevant.  Players could just as well be building skyscrapers.  Neither my wife nor I found these (2) items to be an issue.    If you're looking for a unique and challenging game to play with your husband or wife, then Lost Cities is worth your money.    
 I am in LOVE with Photography again thanks to this camera. It's so easy to use, compact (thus easy to have always) and the pictures are AMAZINGLY clear in all kinds of lighting.  THANK YOU SONY for making PHOTOGRAPHY FUN again!  I'm now using this camera to take a ton of pictures for my students (HS and college) language projects (Go Flickr and movie making!) and podcasting.  AWESEOME. THANK YOU  GRACIAS MERCI 
 There is no dearth of literature on Thomas Jefferson.there are numerous books that offer detailed studies on various aspects of his life, political theory and his career. This book is obviously a brief account of the life and career of Thomas Jefferson. As such, it compromises on a detailed discussion on any one aspect of Jefferson's life, but this is understandable, given the limited scope of the book. Even so the discussion on Jefferson's presidency is a little too brief. However certain topics-such as the Emabargo, are handled fairly well. overall, this book is usefull to anyone who wishes to obtain a bird's eye view of Jefferson's life 
 An invaluable "pocket" book for any woman in recovery. There is so much in it to help the newcomer - or someone who has been in the rooms for a while. Buy it, keep it handy, read it, use it 
 This is one of my favorite films. Very surrealistic, but an original slant on the classic Orpheus. Entertaining special effects. Great romance which includes sacrifice 
 Author Eric Prentis, Ph.D. has written a great, easy-to-read book for anyone interested in stock and/or bond investing. "The Astute Investor" is a book that novices can grow into as Prentis covers the basics of investing, all underlying theories on investing, and the interplay of markets. It will also serve as a great reference book for those who have investing experience but need theory validation or information from time to time (we all do!). Prentis also includes extensive information on how to use the Internet to find current, valuable investing data.   In the author's own words:  	"The Astute Investor presents the collected wisdom from thirty-seven classic books on investing making it the essential investing classic and the one book to read to learn how to invest in the stock market."  Prentis has organized the "The Astute Investor" around the fundamental investing questions:  *	Investing Principles and Strategies o	What investing principles and strategies are important? *	Theory and Practice o	What investing theory and practice are fundamental for investors? *	Equity and Bond Fundamentals o	Is the stock market currently overvalued or undervalued? *	Stock Market Technical Analysis o	Is the stock market in a long-term uptrend or long-term downtrend? *	Trading Psychology o	Why do human emotions get in the way of intelligent investing? *	Intrinsic, Market, and Bargain Values o	How are intrinsic, true, or fair value, market value capitalization, bargain value, and margin-of-safety multiples calculated and what do they mean? *	Interest Rate Principles o	What interest rates should be monitored that typically indicate a long-term stock market top? *	Interpreting the News o	Why do stock market prices often respond "illogically" to the news? *	Being Contrarian o	Being contrarian sounds simple, why is it so difficult to implement? *	The Ten Step Method for Investing Success o	What is a practical and simple method for success? *	Retirement Planning o	How can retirement income be safely doubled? *	Discounted Capital Market Theory o	What new investing theories are the bases for investing success?  The book exceeds expectations and will serve as the only book a purchaser needs to invest with knowledge and confidence. This book could easily become the "gold standard" for explaining stock market investing to all investors - new and old.    
 What an amazing collection of funk/soul tunes played by some of the best musicians of the period and sung by the greatest diva in pop music.  Stop On By is worth the price alone. Please Pardon Me is emotionally gripping.  Once You Get Started is a great starter for any album. I'm A Woman has to be the funkiest song for any female vocalist written. This cd is one that needs to be recognized for greatness!! 
 There is little I can add to all the wonderful reviews that have covered this book. It is a wonderful peak inside monastic life, and the impact that the monastic lifestyle/worldview has upon a soul. Highly recommended 
 The Stones and the PR industry get along very well.  The relationship could be summed up by a London tabloid in the headline, "Stones + PR = Hot and Heavy"  To the Stones, the PR industry is a  young professional woman, like one from a Brooks Brothers catalog, wearing a lightweight sweater of elastic, ribbed grey wool over a smile-inducing bust just a little bit larger than one would expect.  And the PR industry returns the favor, shining its most flattering light on these four sexagenarians, doing its best work for them.   This is an interesting book, just as the bright young lass posited above, is an object of above average interest.  One reads with willing eyes, but one also sees, in the way the book reproduces the quotes from the documentary included with the DVD set `Four Flicks,' that a lot of work has been put into polishing the apple.  Newsflash:  the Stones don't actually talk like that.  What look like off the cuff remarks on the DVD are actually set pieces based on the silky quotations crafted for the book.   I can't knock it.  Darn, I know magazine covers are air-brushed, but I look anyway.  It's a way better book, even if it serves up the Stones like jelly on crumpets, than Wyman's "Rolling with the Stones," which, in comparison, is a view of the Stones from the position of one locked in the rumble seat.  He was there, but I think all he did was collect receipts and make diary entries.  The Stones prove themselves not above trading on their legend and even sugar-coating it a little; you can't tell if they hold their noses while keeping up appearances, but I think they do it at Jagger's behest, knowing that it must be if they're to stay in the business they love so well.  I've focused my listening energies on the Stones for a about a year now, so I forgive them for the top-dressing, because over time, I have found in their music an eerie combination of the utterly ordinary and completely magical -- everything that anyone's said about them is true -- and this combination is evidence that they do fight the good battle everytime they collectively pick up their instruments to create music.  This is why I believe the Stones are the genuine article, authentic (authentic in italics), as the book's sources describe them.  It's in the bones, as Keith says, but in saying that, he's just saying it's in all our bones to try hard and even win sometimes.  P.S.  I'm authentic too, so why ain't I rich?  Because I never mastered PR, not the way the Stones do it.  As Bill Clinton might have said, "It's the PR, Stupid." 
 close to Le Carre's best. highly readable and believable 
 The text is extremely clear and to the point.  The diagrams are also simple to understand. Every major topic in neurosci is discussed, allowing you to get an excellent foundation such that you could read any recent publications on that topic and understand completely what the authors are referring to.  
 What a striking novel. Heard of it from childhood and finally read it. As Laughable as it seemed, there were people very much like the one's in the story. Go deep south in the 40's or 50's and you would have seen them. They were there. They may still be there, or one's like them. Behind all the things that are funny to us lays dire hoplesness,selfishness, ignorance, and failure. But the main idea to the plot is they really didn't know or care. Their lives went on till they died and that was that. Again what a story. 
 What a relief. No whining. No pretentious BS. No attitude disguised as talent. Just a person with an ear and voice for music who sounds good and does whine about everything. Some catchy songs, some fun and no whining. Finally 
 I read this book because I was doing a speech on leaders in one of my classes. I enjoyed his lessons that he presented in each chapter. I knew this would be good because he led NYC out of 9/11 which earned him Time's Man Of The Year for his leadership. Here are some of the lessons that he describes throughout the book so that you have an idea of what to expect.  First Things First Prepare Relentlessly Be Your Own Man Reflect, Then Decide Study. Read. Learn Independently  Those are a few of the chapter titles. These lessons are almost generic, but he does a good job of explaining how he uses them each day. Everyone has there own ways to lead, but Giuliani will go down as one of the greatest for his effort on 9/11. Other than it being by Giuliani there are not any new lessons to learn on leadership. You will just see the ones that he uses to lead 
 I just got this today and it is a nice little MP3 player.  Unlike the old Apple Shuffle I had (that died), this unit has some heft to it, which is nice.  I've heard that the menu system is tricky to figure out, but I found it very easy and intuitive.  The SonicStage software is quirky, but I've never been a fan of needing software to add songs (like iTunes) 
 A fascinating and comprehensive look at a complex, powerful, and manipulative man.  Gentry brings to life the power that Hoover held, power bestowed on him by virtue of the secrets he held in the massive volumes of FBI files he collected over his 48 year tenure.    Hoover's far reach and influence are stunning.  Most people probably have a cursory idea of Hoover's god-like legacy, but Gentry brings out the jaw dropping, scandalous details in vivid candor.  Hoover had leverage over his superiors - the president and the attorney general - as well as his subordinates, Congress, Hollywood, local police jurisdictions, and civil rights leaders.  His sway only increased with every year his held his office.    Gentry's account is exhaustively researched and probably the most extensive and authoritative history of Hoover in existence.  He delves into the paradox that Hoover was, a rigid, aggravating, unlikeable, and deeply vindictive man to many, yet to a few close associates, he was engaging and affable, if not warm, and to him they were 100% loyal.   Hoover was no doubt a product of his time.  For the calculating personality he possessed, who could ask for better career advancement opportunities than to serve in a time of the depression, bootleggers, gansters, the mafia, the Communist red scare, and the Kennedy assasinations successively.  All during Hoover's time at the FBI, there was a valid argument to be made that he was simply indispensible.  The desire of many in government to end his tenure was thwarted time after time, almost to a comical degree.  Hoover was saved by the skin of his teeth more than once by fortuitous turns of events.  Beyond just Hoover, this book explores the dark side of politics in general.  The horse trading, the double dealing, the secret deals, the blacklisting, blackmailing, break-ins, cover-ups, set-ups, take-downs, paybacks, payoffs, and the vindictiveness.  It's ugly, ugly work.  Most would have no idea their own government operates in such a shameful, despicable manner.  Gentry writes in an engaging narrative style that's easy to read and compelling.  The book is well paced and very cohesive despite covering a wide time period and a diverse range of incidents.  The book is lengthy and comprehensive.  It does not skimp on details.  I'm hard pressed to imagine a more thorough account.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in this period of contemporary American history or the fascinating personality that was J. Edgar Hoover.  
 I have read all of Kathy's book they all tell you something.This was by no means my favorite.But there was good stuff in it.There are lot of material on this subject in print.I've read some of it.On a personal note I like a straight-forward murder any day.I hope she moves Tempe & Ryan's together for good they make an excellent couple.And tell us what Tempe status is with her marriage.I went to Montreal last summer and went to all places in the books. Great fun, very cool city 
 The shaver is great for the price.  It provides a very close comfortable shave.  No problems.  I have not checked the battery life yet, but will soon 
 With every Grisham book I read, I get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense, but to insert other elements to make this human as well.  For once, we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain.  However, this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune.  However, she does not know this.  A lawyer is sent to find her, and in the process, undergoes a fundamental change of his own.  This story takes place in Washington, Maryland, West Virginia, and the rain forests along the Brazilian-Bolivian border.  In typical Grisham fashion, he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book, enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes.  You can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions.  You can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight.  You can envision the rainforest, and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of Nate O'Riley.  This is yet another Grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue.  The pages literally turn themselves.  Do not start this novel before going to bed, or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down. 
 This is a review of the Edwin Cannan's edition of Wealth of Nations (ISBN: 0226763749).  Before you read Wealth of Nations, ask yourself, "Why am I reading this?"  If you want to get an introduction to economics, then I suggest another books.  One of the "Dork's Guide to Economics"-type books would be a better choice. I'd recommend Bastiat's "The Law" (ISBN : 0255365098 ), then read Sowell's "Basic Economics" (ISBN: 0465081452) and "Applied Economics" (ISBN: 0465081436).  However, if you want an advanced study of economics, or are an historian, then read this book.  It is an essential classic in American History, on par with "The Federalist," "Democracy In America," and "Common Sense."  Washington embodies the moral aspect of the American Revolution, Madison the governmental aspect, Jefferson the intellectual aspect, and Smith the economic aspect. After all, it is one thing to have a revolution; it is another thing to be able to pay for it.  Smith's main weakness is that he does not deal with economic theory.  The main reason for this is that he had to invent modern economics theory.  He is truly the godfather of the Industrial Revolution: we could not have the financing of Carnegie and Morgan without Adam's Smiths keen insights into the nature of economics and the fallacies of mercantilism.  In a word, Smith pulled the world out of Middle Ages and laid the foundation for the future world prosperity.  Another perceived weakness is that it is over 200 years old.  He uses archaic language, antiquated examples, such as butcher shops, corn trade, tedious histories of government regulation, and so forth. However if you can see past the examples, which are merely "for-instances,"  you can see the underlying economic principles which apply to today's world of microchips, oil, and tofu. That is why I recommend a more contemporary book on economics prior to tackling Smith. You need to know what you are looking for before you can see it.  The Cannan Edition is a nice compromise between the redacted and "selections" editions (which would be good introductions prior to tackling the whole book), and the hyper-footnoted ,scholarly Glasgow Edition. The latter is too technical for a non-economist or non-historian, and you get bogged down in the quagmire of over-precise footnotes.  In his 1789 Thanksgiving Proclamation, George Washington spoke of  "peaceable and rational manner" by which the nation was founded.  Hand in hand with the American Political Revolution was the American Economic Revolution masterminded by Adam Smith.  This book is his contribution to America prosperity, and the prosperity of the entire world.. 
 When you're married to beautiful, glamorous women as our director extraordinaire, Jean-Luc-Godard, you have your moments of doubt. You are an ordinary physical specimen and she is well, Anna Karina, or in the case of Godard's alter ego, screenwriter, Paul Javal, you have many moments of self-doubt from bedroom to soundstage with the nubile Brigitte Bardot. If I give you $30,000 in 1963 money, may I sleep with your wife? Godard invents yet another, now standard film idea, the moral curmudgeon: is my significant other a commodity.  Jack Palance leers over Brigitte and certainly, he has enough Hollywood bucks to install her in his bedroom. In fact, he has enough bucks to turn a work of art into a mass produced cliché. Skin sells in Peoria. Palance is printing dollars as he screens films for rubes, but what of true artists as say, Fritz Lang, the director that made the silent classic M. Lang works around Palance's interference. He must finish what he begins. He will not work for the Third Reich, but will work for Louis Mayer.  Godard works his camera interiors for lengthy, banal conversation between husband and naked wife. Bardot is beautiful and Godard takes every opportunity to look at her, sharing with the voyeurs. The star seems quite comfortable clothed or not. She also looks fine on a Riviera mansion of the Bauhaus architecture overlooking the Mediterranean. This is the sea of the Odyssey, which is the film within a film. Alternatively, should I say there is a production within a film 
 As I wasn't familiar with Gen. S.L.A. Marshall's study previously, Grossman's presentation of low firing rates prior to the Korean conflict was new and intriguing to me.   I thought the outline of common combat responses (fight, flight, posture, submit) and study of military conditioning to increase soldiers' lethality were well presented.  Although I don't completely agree that media violence is to blame for rise in violent crime, it's a valid thesis that merits investigation. I found this book to be prescient, as it predated the events at Columbine (my own thoughts are that sociopaths are sociopaths regardless of movie and video game influence).  I recommend it for academic study as well as to those in military and law enforcement professions who would benefit from understanding their conditioning and their own probable reactions to or anxieties about combat.   
 I like a good horror film, and this is among the best. I just watched it again for the umpteenth time this Halloween (yesterday) and found it to be just as enjoyable this time around. The energy that went into this project is evident, its sincerity genuine. What makes this movie so good is a great combination of many factors: the music is compelling and unforgettable; the cinematography is quite good while remaining unobtrusive, and the suspense is sustained from the opening frames to the closing. Although filmed in California, the film perfectly captures the flavor of Halloween and fall in the Midwest: leaves, having fallen from the trees, blowing around in the wind; cicadas and crickets singing, providing a nightly chorus, and the traditions of Halloween, including the ubiquitous pumpkins, popcorn and horror movie marathons. Haddonfield is every town in the Midwest and its residents quite typical. The feel of this setting makes the film seem familiar and plausible. Apparently quite comfortable in the realms of both teenagers and adults, John Carpenter melds the two worlds seamlessly. Too many horror films, or films of any other genre, for that matter, cannot seem to get this correct. The adults are typically treated like the enemy or too dense to catch on. Teens are normally reduced to caricatures, all hormones and no sense. The treatment of the "good guys" isn't the only aspect of this movie that distinguishes it from the rest of the lot, however. Michael Myers is a legend in the town and his story is well known among the locals. For him to come home does not seem possible because that would mean breaking down the wall that separates reality from myth. Yet, he is a real person (or character, that is), not an imaginary Boogie Man. After Michael kills one of his victims, he stands with head cocked, staring at him. The camera holds this for a few seconds, allowing us to contemplate just what is going through his mind. Prior to this point, we have only heard Dr. Loomis' resolute claims that Michael is somehow subhuman. Now we witness his confusion and bewilderment, much as a dog cocks its head and stares at a small animal it has just killed. Does he not realize the nature of what he has done or the finality as the result of his actions? Is he wondering who this person is? Is he wondering why the man has stopped moving? In this moment, we are voyeurs, catching a glimpse of Michael Myers alone, not stalking, terrorizing or killing. We don't have a victim's reaction to inveigle us, only a maniac's attempt to comprehend the world around him. Perhaps it sounds as though I am making too much of this movie. To someone who yearns for a well-made horror film he can appreciate, a film like "Halloween" matters substantially.   
 Sometimes you listen to a piece of music for the first time and it strikes you that it sounds so original yet so logical, so beautiful and natural yet so rare. This is how this music struck me when I first heard it in LP 20+ years ago. Is a recording for the ages. When the trombones come in out of nowhere in "La nevada" you feel taken by them, yet you feel like there is nothing else that could have come in but these bones. "Where Flamingos Fly" is a masterpiece of arranging and shows the artistry of Jimmy Knepper. The session continues with one beautiful surprise after another. Do yourself a favor and get this recording if is the only one you can get.  
 My spouse and I are both using this product and enjoy the slight taste of chocolate it gives the morning coffee 
 JSF has created a charming, thought-provoking and absolutely hysterical novel that takes you on Jon-Fen's (sic) journey to find his 'roots'. Coupled with a deranged canine and a 'blind' driver, the journey totally sucks you in and doesn't disappoint 
 Shipping quicker than the estimated time, perfect state... Hmmm about the book, it was good although i expected a different thing, it was sort of a self biography with some notes on receptors, molecules and its relation to the field of psychoneuroimmunology. Since i am a physician, i found it very simple 
 Very seasonal--fall & Halloween themes featuring the sibling drama of Max & Ruby.  My girls (1 1/2 & 3) just adore it 
 This book is a must have for new parents/parents to-be. There is so much information to help guide new parents. Even for experienced parents this book is great! It provides weekly updates of baby's social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development helping parents to make the most of the essential developmental periods! I also have the Your Pregnancy Week by Week and that is a terrific book for pregnant parents. These books are so informative and provide so much terrific info 
 Gregory Peck plays writer Philip S. Green in Elia Kazan's Best Picture Oscar winning film adaptation of Laura Z. Hobson's controversial novel, GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. Daring for 1947, it seems rather tame now.   Green is an investigative reporter who 'becomes Jewish' for several months in order to discover the truth about anti-Semitism in post-World War Two America. What he finds out about ingrained prejudice is profoundly disturbing, especially when it invades his own home.   Peck is brilliant in the role, as is actor John Garfield, who plays Dave Goldman, his best friend. The rest of the cast is uneven, and the film loses itself too often in ham-handed moralizing and philosophizing which takes away from the story.   Still, it is difficult not to be sickened as the dapper Peck is turned away from a "Gentiles Only" establishment for no other reason than his assumed identity as a Jew; it is horrifying to see his young son (Dean Stockwell) traumatized after being attacked in the schoolyard for being a 'kike'; and worst of all, it is terrible to hear Peck's supposedly liberal girlfriend (Dorothy McGuire) comfort the boy with the words, "But it's not true...You're not any more Jewish than I am."  GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT has its flaws. It never gets its hands dirty by addressing the prejudices of anyone but the tennis club set, and it handles the issue the same way someone might approach a person with poor hygiene.   Yet, despite its shortcomings it dared to attack a very real and (to that point) unaddressed social problem then (and sadly still) existing in an open and democratic United States flush with its victory over Nazi Germany, underscoring that whether by Nuremberg Law or Gentleman's Agreement, prejudice is intolerable in a viable society.        
 Another great album from karsh kale! Unlike other ethno techno artists, this album has new fusion beats that sound nothing like his older albums. I would recommend this album to all old fans or those who want to explore ethnic old-school beats fused with new age cuts. tracks 2,3,5,12,4 stand out, but the rest are just as great 
 It has been my privilege to read and re-read this book with some teenagers who have formerly claimed their reluctance to read. Peter Sis gave us all the opportunity to read the pictures first: why the sepia toned photos and the father-shaped holes? Why the mandelas? The maps? The diary entries? Once engaged, and fuelled by the tidal oscillations of the various layers of drawings, composed symphonically, we could not help but read the book. For a generation accustomed to video players this book let us pause, fast-forward, rewind... a book to read forwards, backwards, and inside out. Sis lets us know that books are a treasure, that books can walk beside us for a lifetime and nourish the mind and soul in imaginings... I add this one to my list of 1000 books I would proudly give to any child 
 They are a great way to help learn the human Anatomy.  They have good easy pictures to follow.  There are a few mistakes in the set but you will know when you see them.  For the price they are good learning tool 
 Our grandchildren ages 4 & 2 are coming to visit & this will be a fun book to read with them 
 I believe Dickens intended this to be more exciting and action packed than most of his other novels. For example, in Great Expectations and Hard Times, Dickens makes heavy statements on social issues, but in this, he is letting his action and adventure side go wild. He is telling more of a story, not so much declairing a point. But it is still good. It is wonderful the way Dickens captures the mind-set of the mob and his describing the storming of the Bastille. I also loved Mr. Darnay, and the way he is so trustworthy to Lucie and his friends. I also loved the raw down-to-earth realism of Sydney Carton. His fate, I thought, was very sad indeed.  So a great book!!  Bravo, Mr. Dicken 
 Robin Jones Gunn masterfully puts together another great book about God, love, friendships, and family.  This book really looks at what love is and how you know if you are in love.  Its about more than just emotions.  Also,  what makes this book even better is the humor.  I laughed out loud so much  my husband truly thought I was nuts. This books has wonderful character  development; one of Mrs. Gunn's greatest strengths in her books is her  characters and the details of their ficitional lives.  A must read for  everyone 
 I read this book when I was going through a divorce several years ago.  The handbook helped me to review the thinking that was contributing to my depression. Although my depression was situational, I was overwhelmed and was filtering information negatively.  Recently, my son went through a depression and I gave him this book and another excellent book, Optimal Thinking--How to Be Your Best Self that provides specific questions to resolve disturbing emotions.  I recommend each of these books 
 I'm becoming a true crime reader expert this summer.  I find the thinking from the other side intresting. It's nice to have both points of view written up about a murder case.  Michael Skakel couldn't get anyone to write up his side of the story. 
 Great book, lots of fun!  These are well writen fun books that are a brief departure in the 'chic lit' genre from reading about single girls problems with boys, friends, and jobs.  Enjoy 
 As always I enjoyed this Fannie Fagg story!  Just a good ole' heartwaming book that was an easy read on a cold winter's night!  
 Criminal defense attorney, Mickey Haller, is thrilled to find himself in the position of defending Louis Ross Roulet against a charge of attempted rape and aggravated sexual assault with grievous bodily injury for his alleged attack of Reggie Campeau, a hooker with a past. Roulet is what experienced attorneys call a "franchise" client - he's willing to be billed full schedule A top dollar legal fare, he's got the money to pay and he wants to go the distance in his own defense. But Roulet's compelling intensity and the story he tells disturbs and frightens Haller because, despite his rock solid prohibition against asking his client whether he did it or not, Haller becomes convinced of his client's innocence. He recalls his deceased father's advice to other lawyers, "The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client." Haller knows that mistakes could result in a lethal injection and the execution of an innocent man.  It's only when Haller recognizes the startling similarities in appearance between the victim, Campeau, and Martha Rentoria, the victim of Jesus Menendez, one of Haller's former clients (who is now cooling his heels for life in San Quentin for that particular murder) that Haller begins to scratch his head and investigate Roulet's case more deeply. All is not as it seems as Haller not only wrestles with legal ethical dilemmas but even finds himself in the disturbing position of being investigated as a suspect for the very assault for which he is defending Roulet. Even his family has been threatened and Haller must take action to protect his daughter and ex-wife, to resolve his ethical legal dilemmas, to clear his own name as a suspect, to free Menendez from what he now knows is an unjust conviction and, in the bargain, to snag the mastermind behind the whole twisted mess! A tall order indeed but Connelly has proven that he is up to the task. He's also tossed in a beautiful plot twist at the very point where a reader would be convinced all was in hand.  It's difficult to expect much more out of any crackerjack suspense novel.  Characters are marvelously developed - the baddie in the piece is portrayed as truly evil and abhorrent (in fact, you can almost feel the shivers going up and down your back when Haller recoils from his simple touch); Fernando Valenzuela, the bail bondsman, and Raul Levin, Haller's crack investigator, are wonderfully down to earth and realistic; Maggie McPherson, Haller's ex-wife, is portrayed as a skilled competent prosecutor but also frequently lapses into a man's stereotypical bitchy ex-wife. Even Teddy Vogel, a top lieutenant in the Road Saints motorcycle gang is colourfully portrayed and jumps completely alive off the page! Dialogue is realistic and credible. Connelly's expertise in the legal field is obvious as he gives us an extraordinary insider's look at the procedural machinations of both the defense and prosecution sides of the law system as well as the official police and unofficial defense investigation of a crime.  Grisham, Baldacci, Tannenbaum - look to your laurels! There is a new star in the firmament of legal thrillers and his name is Michael Connelly. It will be a sad day indeed if Connelly doesn't reach the decision to bring Haller and his team back again for our enjoyment.  Paul Weiss 
 i got this disc a few years back.I liked some of the other tracks but it was mainly for "Natural High" that song just floats&Moves Me.this is a Very Underrated Group.they had some Jams but there Monster Jams Overshadow so much 
 I saw this when it was first broadcast.  It has not lost any of its power of the years 
 This is one of several Hemingway books I have come to read, actually in this case, listen to.  I loathe idling about so I decided while I wait, wherever that maybe, I would listen to an audiobook. I prefer the unabridged versions which in this case was quite long.  I found the subject matter mysteriously complex ( who doesn't find love  complex ) yet simplistic in it's exposition true to Hemingway's style.  Each character is carefully developed and his/her relationships meticulously crafted and consistent with their dispositions.  Hemingway explores humanity and allows us a glimpse of it in the most trying circumstances....love and war. It really is very hard to discuss the book without ruining details and the outcome so I will stop here.  I would suggest getting the audicopy on ipod and listening to it on your next long journey overseas 
 Although most reviewers rated this book highly, a few panned it. With one or two of those reviews, I wonder if they're even talking about the same book. Crazy ninjas? Martial fetishism? I just don't see that here.  To answer a few of the more intelligible criticisms:  The low stances pictured in this book will not necessarily get you killed or "at least whomped" in a fight. If you're even a beginner in a style that uses low stances, you can use the moves presented here. Of course, if you try these stances for the first time having only seen them in a book, you'll probably do them wrong. Well, no kidding!  Some anonymous wit here remarked that you only need such fancy techniques if you "forget how to swing a bat"-- as if wielding a stick against an unarmed person is an automatic win. This attitude will get you killed faster than any karate stance. I am a small guy of not even intermediate skill, and I've taken bats away from far larger persons who were trying to knock my head into the bleachers! If I can do it, so can some street punk who's trying to put your lights out. This book shows exactly what to do when someone grabs you or your stick and tries to turn the tables on you.  Others accuse the authors of assuming your attacker will be unarmed and won't fight back. I can only say these critics didn't read this book. The authors are very clear on these points.  As for the complexity of some of the locks and takedowns, the authors state that you cannot always deploy these when you want to, and that in the meantime you should defend yourself with basic moves. They also stress that one technique will not always (if ever) be enough to end the fight. They emphasize that the complex techniques must be executed quickly and forcefully. This takes practice. You are not supposed to just flip through a martial arts book and go try this stuff on the streets.  Gee, no kidding!  Even if you never practice the advanced techniques presented here, they are interesting. And the basic techniques are, well, basic. I say buy this book, and to its detractors, I say read this book! And pay attention this time 
 Ewan McGregor joins another fine ensemble cast.   It's always been fashionable to say everything has been written/said/filmed/whatever before. As an author/reading junkie/movie buff, sometimes I start to believe it. Then a film like this comes along and kicks me squarely on my ample backside. Humor that's dark, witty, wicked, gritty, accurate. Based on a novel by someone with a true appreciation of, and a gift for, the language. No hesitation to smack you hard with the grim reality of heroin addiction.   You're groaning. I can tell. You're thinking this is such a stale subject that it only proves my opening premise. But, you're wrong. Yet another keeper. Maybe I'll stay out of the DVD stores and let my lovely wife keep buying the films. I ignored this one for years because the cover's so ugly.   I'm sure the novel was fantastic, and I know it must be damn hard to translate such novels to the screen because we've seen so many failures. But with a great screenwriter plus the right production team and actors, it can be done. It has been done. If you spot this, consider picking it up. But do read the reasons it's rated R. It's not for the kids.  
 I really liked this book. It is a classic book for those who are interested in managing their finances according to Biblical principles, and for those who have landed themselves into debt. Larry Burkett teaches biblical principles of debt-management by telling stories... stories collected over years of counseling thousands of struggling individuals and couples. Some of the previous reviewers have said that these stories are just anecdotal scare-tactics, but the intriguing thing is that I see highly-educated people around me making the same "anecdotal" mistakes with their finances (and reaping the consequences). Americans (in general) have no clue how much house they can afford, etc. and regard debt as a necessary evil... or even as a good thing. This book helps you to see debt in a more balanced light, and is highly recommended to anyone who struggles in this area.  As you can see by some of the other reviews, if you're not a Christian, you'll probably get hung up on some of the biblical principles: such things like keeping your word even when it costs you money, family leadership principles, living within your means, and the husband-wife relationship. So if you're not a Christian, I would suggest taking a serious look at the Bible (by studying what it says) and then compare it to the principles in this book. I think you'll find that the Bible is reliable and timeless in its guidelines for finances just as it is for every other area of life 
 Do you play the lottery?  If so, you'll feel an affinity with appropriately named, JoLayne Lucks, the heroine of this novel.    How would your life be changed if you suddenly won $14 million?  Naturally, you would find good use for it.  But what negative consequences would follow?  If you favor your privacy, personal safety and sanity, you will find Lucky You presents a living nightmare of all the things that can go wrong.    Naturally, lottery winners become targets for all kinds of fraud.  In fact, some will even try to claim that they own the winning tickets.  But how often do envious people actually try to steal the ticket?  That's the premise of this book.  The plot line though is merely an excuse for the ever satirical Mr. Hiaasen to unloose his humor on those who operate beyond the fringes of legal and ethical behavior including purveyors of fake religious miracles, crooked officials, cheating spouses, white supremacists, racists, the mob, counterfeiters and thieves.  In addition, the humor spills over to include those who marry too quickly and unwisely, overeager managers and law clerks, and the overconfidence of men.  Those who enjoy reading about writing will be thrilled by the many satirical references in the book to the degradation of the written word in small town newspapers.   Mr. Hiaasen is at his best when he focuses narrowly on fields of endeavor that he knows well.  There his humor is sharp, on target and original.  When he moves outside of his arena, the humor moves into burlesque and broad strokes that tend to belabor an obvious point past its potential.  That's the weakness of this book.  He's mostly off solid ground for his humor.  Because his targets are people for whom we feel little sympathy, the humor sort of works.    This book contains one of Mr. Hiaasen's favorite themes:  the significance of natural beauty being marred by greedy people.  But there's no Skink here to take the story line to its usual brilliant potential.    If you are, however, a fan of Mr. Hiaasen, I definitely recommend this book to you.  Just realize that this isn't one of his most brilliant efforts.  Appreciate what you have and live in harmony!  
 She can sing and she is beautiful and that is just the beginning. This is a spectacular live performance with her large and talented band on stage. This VHS features her dynamic live show from her world tour. She is a hot performer - very high energy and a skilled performer with lots of magic.   Some of the reviews of the DVD referred to poor sound quality. I am reviewing the same concert on VHS and the sound was very good on the VHS 
 As all the other reviewers have stated Ballas is a vile human being, but to the authors credit he does not try to make him more than what he is. He doesn't suddenly become more noble at each juncture of the quest. We watch his interactions and each time we insinuate ourselves into his thoughts hoping and well for me urging that just this once he will act honorably, he will be that noble character we have come to expect in fantasy novels. He never comes through...he remains a vile individual, he is a plain dealing villain. But we do see him grow, we see him come to think more of the world then just being a series of whores and pubs. He becomes someone who, in a sense comes to self realization, and this is why I loved Monumen 
 My favorite Vince Flynn book is still "Term Limits", but I really enjoyed "Act of Treason" and am anxiously awaiting Mr. Flynn's next Mitch Rapp novel.  Highly recommended.  
 Design Patterns is an essential book for every software developer or architect. It was ground breaking for it's time, describing reusable design patterns that recur in software development projects.  The presentation used makes reading and understanding the concepts easy, and allows one to learn and apply the patterns a few at a time. It's a great reference book, and the distilling and naming of the patterns really aids communication between developers 
 After seeing how  many reviews "Angela's Ashes" have, I was hesitating if I should add my own. At the end, I decided to do so, without reading the other reviews. Maybe I will repeat things already said, but I wanted to express my opinion because this book deserves all the good words it gets.   Memoir is an increasingly popular type of prose - essentially, everyone feels they can write a memoir. And this is true, of course. The difficult thing, which not just anyone can achieve, is writing a good memoir, which would stand out of the crowd. Frank McCourt succeeded in this respect.   "Angela's Ashes" describe the the author's memories from his earliest years until he is nineteen. His family is central to the book, which starts when his parents, Angela and Malachy, meet, they live in Brooklyn, where Frank, his brother Malachy, the twins and the sister are born. Then it follows the family through the deaths of several children, the return to Ireland, the fight with objective difficulties as well as the personal faults, Frank's illnesses, observations, the life of the street children and poor people in Limerick, Frank's school years during the World War II, until his travel back to America. The family is, in a way, a typical Irish family with a curse of alcoholism hanging over it, with the history of Ireland present at every moment, with the respect for Irish tradition and Catholic church, with poverty and daily struggle. But despite the accurate descriptions of the shortcomings of his parents, and a great dose of bitterness and criticism, McCourt manages to show his affection towards them and leave the reader without doubt as to his love for both of them. The insights into the society, system and life of the community are very accurate and sharp as well.  The book, written from a position of the child growing up, which is reflected in the language and imagery, evokes powerful emotions. So strong, that it brigs tears to the eyes and leaves the reader in wonder. There is, however, a fair share of humor especially later in the book, so everything is well balanced yet natural.  The Pullitzer prize was, in this case, deserved. I heartily recommend "Angela's Ashes" and will definitely read (and review) "'Tis".  
 Dean Radin is one of the most important parapsychological researchers today, and Entangled Minds is a testiment to the excellence of his work. Dean has devoted his life to demystifying this realm--a challenging task considering most people in modern society are out of touch with their intuitive side. I am grateful to Dean for this book, and the selfless efforts he puts forth to help our world perceptually evolve. I recommend Entangled Minds to everyone who wants to know the science behind psi, and the studies that have been done to document it. 
 It is a tragic, heart wrenching account of an unfortunate simple man, Yakov Bok, a handyman, a Fixer. He is also a Jew, living during waning days of Tsar Nichols II. He is falsely accused of murdering a boy of 10, a case reminiscent of Dryfus affair, who was also falsely charged and sent to prison, later exonerated, however. It is a remarkable tale of suffering, faith, hatred, endurance and above all triumph of truth. One is helpless when the whole state, the establishment commits such dastardly act. Yakov is doomed as wherever he turns he runs into blood drenched anti-Semitic wall. He spends horrifying three years in solitary confinement just to get his indictment. He waits and he fights against insurmountable odds, never compromising on his principals. Finally Yakov gets his indictment and goes to trial. This book must rank among the best 100 books of 20th cenury.  Before we tell ourselves that such horrible deeds do not occur in our free society, think of Abu Gharib, Gauntanamo and recent revelation of kidnapping of passengers and flying them to foreign countries for interrogation under torture. How many Yakovs are in prison today? 
 This book was required reading for my youth ministry class in college. It has not only defined my vision of youth ministry, but it has changed my entire outlook on all aspects of Christian ministry. The images that Dean  and Foster use are both biblical and ingenius. Who would ever have thought  of taking the New Testament passage where Gabriel tells Mary  that she has  been chosen to bring God into the world and apply it to youth ministry?  This book should be in the library of every person who works with youth 
 A very sensitive and touching movie about a boy and his teacher. It has some gratutious scenes and the story does not flow very smoothly, but none the less worth watching and the ending reveals alot about humanity throughout the ages. 
 Das Experiment (Oliver Hirshbiegel, 2001)  Hirschbiegel, who stunned the world a few years back with Der Untergang, always had the chops to make tense, scary movies, and Das Experiment proves it. Also based on a true story, this is a film about a psychological experiment gone horribly wrong, as twenty volunteers are put into a prison situation, with eight "guards" and twelve "prisoners," for two weeks. By the second day, the guards are acting like guards, and the prisoners are acting like prisoners, with the exception of Tarek Fahd (Munich's Moritz Bleibtreu), ostensibly a cab driver, but actually an undercover reporter (while the revelation of this in the film is wonderfully done, the DVD box spoils this little surprise, so I have no qualms about mentioning it here) who's covering the experiment for his paper. Things go horribly wrong in an astonishingly short amount of time, and while one of the doctors, Jutta Grimm (Andrea Sawatzki) begins to question the ethics of continuing the experiment, project leader Thon (Edgar Selge) is enthusiastic about the speed with which everything's going to pot. Needless to say, things get out of control, and everyone involved, including the viewer, quickly becomes aware that no matter what happens, there is no way this is going to end well.  Hirschbiegel is a fantastic director, and here as in Der Untergang he's got a solid stable of actors and a terrific script to back up his native talent. If you've seen Der Untergang (and even if you haven't), check this out. It's well worth your time. *** 
  There IS a newer greatest hits available now that tries to span this bands entire studio career on one disc. Eventually they may try to span a whole live career onto another?  THESE ARE THE EARLY GOODS, AND THE ONES THAT BEGGINERS NEED TO KNOW.  TRUCKIN, was my first glimpse, and was like my favorite song when I was about seven.  GRATEFUL DEAD taught me that skeletons in the closet wasn't a scary thing at all (as long as there was a blonde with him and he was smoking a big fat joint.) They were in fact, quite peaceful.  YEAH, if you have no clue about the DEAD start right here. It's cheaper than the new "greatest" package and it has the best material crammed onto one disc.  If you need more info than that then... ST STEPHEN UNCLE JOHNS BAND MEXICALLI BLUES and especially FRIEND OF THE DEVIL  dig? The next step is ONE FROM THE VAULT, when you are ready for your head to explode. ENJOY THE RIDE. 
 I greatly enjoyed this book. Some wonderful writing about the natural world of Canada and a family dealing with a crisis in believable and touching ways, showing a sort of family responsibility rare today.   That said, it's not for everyone. It's much more a character book than a plot book, which means that some may find it slow. Cover reviews said the author managed to steadily amp up the tension, but I thought that was overstating the case a bit. Yes, there was tension -- more of a creeping sense of dread -- but it stayed at a pretty steady level.  Quibbles: the "disaster" hinted at throughout the book was quite predictable and thus, no shock or surprise. Also, I thought the ending was a bit unbelievable and rushed. But otherwise, a very readable book for those who want something a little meatier to tackle 
 I'm astonished at the tenor and number of negative reviews "A Theory of Justice" has garnered from the right. This is especially surprising because Rawls shares with American conservatives one fundamental principle: the inviolability of the individual.  A "Theory of Justice" is a technical work aimed at professional philosophers, political scientists, and constitutional law specialists. Nevertheless, the book is understandable by laymen, provided it is read as what it is, i.e. a technical work of moral philosophy and not as a political agenda. Rawls's simple and plain style also makes this book a relatively easy read.  I suspect that the rejection of Rawls by even the more thoughtful conservatives stems from a serious misunderstanding of utilitarianism, which Rawls savagely attacks from the start. Utilitarianism is the moral principle that the TOTAL welfare of a society is the highest value. In practice, the only measure of total welfare the government has is GDP, so that's what we maximize: GDP. This makes utilitarianism attractive to laissez-faire capitalist philosophies, and because Rawls attacks utilitarianism, both the left and the right imagine he is attacking markets, industry, and capitalism. The left have made him their angel, and so the right their demon.  Rawls makes no attack on capitalism, only on utilitarianism. He asserts the inviolability of the individual as society's primary moral principle and demonstrates that this is incompatible with utilitarianism. For example, under utilitarianism, it makes sense to take Bob's heart, give it to Stan, and to give his lungs to John. You've saved two lives by sacrificing one, so society is on the whole better off with two members (Stan and John) rather than just one (Bob). This is obviously wrong and that's why we want to jettison this (im)moral philosophy.  Another misconception is that Rawls does not accept inequality. This is false: Rawls accepts inequality provided that those at the bottom benefit from the inequality. For instance let's say John wants to become rich and so invents a pill that for ten dollars/person eliminates the risk of cancer in his hometown. John sells the pill and becomes rich and everyone is cured from cancer. John is better off than anyone else, but everyone else is better off than they would have been under an egalitarian society.  Yet another misconception is that Rawls wants to establish a Utopian plan for a perfect society. He does not. Rawls is not a revolutionary trying to reinvent society; he is a theoritical moral philosopher, a professional academic researcher, who seeks to isolate the basic principles that define what we mean by "Justice".  This is a fair goal and a valid program of study. Everyone wants a just society; after all does anyone campaign for an unjust or unfair society? But we disagree as to what we mean by "Justice".  The real object of Rawls's work is to replace utilitarianism with a better concept of the social good, or of Justice. A Theory of Justice is his attempt at this.  Vincent Poirier, Toky 
 In close to 600 pages that are much denser than most business and self-help books, John Lucht doles out a thorough treatment of every topic you'd expect to see, and then some.  Lucht's description of the executive recruitment business is espeicially illuminating - I would have distributed my resume far too freely if I hadn't read this book.  Several chapters are dedicated to finding recruiters, separating the good from the bad, and recruiter interactions.  Of course, there is also plenty of networking, interviewing, and resume-writing advice.  It seems that Lucht approached this book as if writing his own resume: it's jam-packed with facts, and doesn't mince words; it has a flowing narrative style punctuated by headlines for easy scanning; it touts his credibility, accomplishments, and recruiting services without inflated, ambiguous adjectives.  It's not perfect, though.  Lucht overhypes the subscription services on his Web site, ritesite.com.  He repeats certain points mind-numbingly often.  He suggests that people include marital status, height, and weight on resumes; as a small, single woman, I doubted that.  Some of his internet job search suggestions are already outdated, and his preference of old-fashioned direct mail is questionable for technology industry jobs.  But given his vast experience, his opinions are certainly valid.  And most of his suggestions are painstakingly justified by facts and examples.  I recommend buying the accompanying Executive Job-Changing Workbook.  It provides additional resume and interview coaching, and its worksheets are useful tools for organizing thoughts 
 This book is very well written and exceedingly useful.  I would highly recommend it to anyone considering publishing a non-fiction book.  
 One of my very best cds in my collection.  I never get sick of listening to the Be Good Tanyas 
 The most striking thing about Jeremy Enigk's World Waits, the much-anticipated follow-up to his 1996 solo album Return Of The Frog Queen, is its constant and seamless stylistic shifts. Even the brief opener "A New Beginning" evolves from ambient guitar picking punctuated by the cyclical panning of ethereal female voices, to the grandeur of what sounds like a fully orchestrated rock opera overture, in about a minute and a half. The other nine tracks that make up World Waits range from thoughtful folk-tinged pop ("River To Sea") to quirky, deliberately restrained indie rock ("Canons"), all held together by Jeremy's trademark voice, often stacked on top of itself and drenched in reverb.  Along the way, his experimental nature is still evident, though it comes out in very different ways than the psychedelic orchestrations and spastic vocal outbursts that made Frog Queen so adventurous. "City Tonight" is a mid-tempo rocker laden with Depeche Mode synths underneath a chorus of call-and-response vocal layering, while "Wayward Love" pits lush strings and 70s prog vocal harmonies against classical guitar and swelling keyboard pads, propelled through a brief two-minutes by distant hand drums. Meanwhile the unresolved arpeggios of "Dare A Smile" sound at once sweet and anxious against the constant pedal tone, as the song slowly churns with its soothing but nightmarish beauty.  For all the instrumentation and full orchestrations found on World Waits, the production wisely never gets in the way of Jeremy's vocals, which are as strong as ever at both extremities of his range. The most memorable moments are those when everything gives way to allow as much space as possible to showcase his voice, such as in "Damien Dreams," which ranges from his lowest raspy hum, to a screeching, tortured cry. An especially moving moment is the soaring vocal melody of the first verse of "Burn," made all the more effective by its sparse accompaniment, a simple piano/organ drone.  As with Return Of The Frog Queen, the biggest (and perhaps only) complaint that can be made about World Waits, is that it's over far too quickly. In 36 minutes, Enigk manages to effortlessly combine a myriad of genres and bend them to his whim, while stretching his voice from a rich, low growl, to an airy falsetto. His longtime fans will surely cherish the album as an instant classic that holds up against his earlier work, even Sunny Day Real Estate's 1998 masterpiece "How It Feels To Be Something On." I only hope that there is enough good press to get this album the attention it deserves, so that the insatiable appetite of his adoring public might be able to see a follow-up without waiting another ten years 
 Everyone grab your picnic baskets and hold them tight, because Yogi Bear is back, in DVD form.  All of the Yogi Bear episodes from The Yogi Bear Show are included; the absent episodes that many have said were excluded were shown as part of The Huckleberry Hound Show.  Warner Bros does a fabulous job with DVD sets, and this set will not disappoint.  The picture and sound look great along with a few extras.  No complaints come to mind, if you like Yogi Bear then this is the set for you.  So take a trip back to Jellystone with Yogi, Boo Boo, and Ranger Smith grab a snack and remember a classic 
 Don't listen to the people who didn't "get it" or couldn't "follow it".  Go to the book store and read the Prologue.  If those two pages don't speak to you, you don't deserve the riches the book has to offer.  
 I had never read anything by Anna Quindlen before so this was my first book.  I will be picking up more of her books as she proves to be a good author.  The story was on an excellent subject although it did jump back and forth quite a bit.  I am married and have never been in a situation like this character but the author easily made you feel the panic, fear and heart wrenching decision making in a way that made you understand the subject matter at hand with a more attentiveness to the real world.  
 I've read many books on war and suffering and it's rare that one moves me enough to write a review.  Dr. Ngor's memoir is arguably the most powerful book that I've ever read.  It's not pretty, and the ending is not nearly as happy as I would have liked (or a Hollywood movie would have), but it does give a ray of hope in the face of such unspeakable horror.  Ironically, I found the account of Dr. Ngor's troubled later life as a celebrity, trying to deal with his past, just as moving as his suffering under the Khmer Rouge 
     With his first two albums, Prince had yet to develop into a serious or lucrative artist.  That all changed when he released his third album, 1980's Dirty Mind.  The production was a landmark in new-wave pop, R&B, and urban funk.  It also broke new ground in its explicit sexual and personal content.  Nobody before the album's release has bared so much.  Nearly every aspect of sexuality is discussed here: Homosexuality, excessive libido,  threesomes, oral sex, incest, sexual freedom: everything Prince could think of.  The album was recorded at his home studio with Prince playing nearly every instrument, with the exception of Dr Fink playing synthesizers on some of the tracks and Lisa Coleman doing some of the backup vocals.  The album opens with the title track, a four minute robotic funk jam that sums up the whole album.  When you here lyrics about laying down a woman in your daddy's car you know your entering some interesting subjects and lyrical themes.  The most notorious subjects are explained in tracks six and seven.  Track six titled,"Head", is the most explicit number about oral sex ever written.  "Sister," is one and a half minutes of incest, lost of virginity, oral sex, nudity, and graphic language.  Threesomes are discussed in track two and four while homosexuality and sexual freedom are discussed in tracks three and five.  The closing track titled,"Partyup", is a relentless dance jam about dancing and partying as opossed to fighting in a war.  To sum it up, 1999 and Purple Rain might not have come around if this album wasn't made.  At only a half-hour long this album makes for a nice, short easy listen.  Get this album and see what most pop and hip-hop has been built upon 
 Great flavor, easy to dispense, and a nice metal canister!  I'm not a big connoisseur of teas, but the fact that it was green tea helped me decide to try it.  And, for the nice price, I'm glad I did.  Will be nice to give a canister away here and there to friends and family.  
 The flowers not only arrived in good time, they were also so lovely.  My friend, who loves roses, was very impressed.  Definitely a great purchase 
 I read this book based on suggestion from someone else.  I would not have picked it up on my own. But I'm glad I did. It opened my eyes to the "business" of drugs and the profit surrounding it.  It shattered my naive belief that a company producing drugs and an organization created to protect my safety would always do the right thing. It also was a good teaching element for how government, business, and the legal arm work in the pharmaceutical industry.  At the end I felt for the average person who innocently takes a prescribed product. This book has made me forever wary 
 if you're new to Hedwig, sure, get the soundtrack.  if you're stuck on the performances on the soundtrack and not the songs/spirit of it..then stick with the soundtrack.  this album of covers, however, is pretty great.  the choices of bands/artists are appropriate and interesting for each song.  They all add their own signatures to the covers...so...I guess it helps if you're familiar with the bands on the album, but nonetheless it's a great companion to the soundtrack 
 I had intended to write an extended review of Gordon's very engaging book, but then noticed the number of other reviews already done and decided not to reinvent the wheel.  The reviewer immediately before me, Mr. Sageev, has done an excellent job of describing the book and enumerating its many virtues.  Read his review...then read the book.  I will underline one point:  this is NOT a dry economics text as you might fear; it is hugely entertaining and illuminates many aspects of American history.  And "entertaining" need not mean "sophomoric."  The book is economic history made popular, but it is solidly grounded.  In that regard it reminds one of Robert Heilbroner's books half a generation ago.  
 If you want to understand the violence at Littleton on a more profound level than the superficialities offered up by the media, this book is a good place to start 
 The is one of the best movies I have seen in years.  It has been described as a movie about a dysfunctional family, but I disagree.  On an important level, these people are us.  Do all of us win all the time?  True, in a sense, everyone in the family is a "loser."  They do not succeed in that quintessential  "American" way.  The father isn't great at his job, the mother complains because there isn't enough money, the son is colorblind, Olive isn't "pretty" in that beauty contest kind of way, the Uncle is gay, has lost a prestigious job, and is unhappy in love, and Grandpa snorts cocaine to numb his pain.  These do not sound like unusual problems to me, but together, they do make for a lot of really funny and poignant moments.  FYI:  This is not a Hollywood Myth about the underdog winning the day.  I say "Yay!"  Aren't you tired of those?  I think the movie wants us to ask ourselves what the word "loser" means.  Each person in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has failed in some important dream, but are we so enraptured with the American Myth of "success" that we would truly call this family dysfunctional?  The Myth tells us that "anybody" can do "anything" as long as he or she believes hard enough.  I think the movie is saying that the Myth is a dysfunctional myth. The problem with these characters in the beginning is not that they have dreams, but that they are afraid to fail.  Failure in America is a dirty word:  if you can't succeed in America, then where?   At the end of the movie, although each character has failed in a significant way, each is a winner in a deeper sense.  And they certainly do not come across to me as "losers" or as a dysfunctional family.  I think they finally are seeing some things clearly for the first time.  This is a movie filled with humor and humanity.  It is a wonderful antidote to a myth that would make us all feel like "losers" when things don't go our way.  I wish there were more movies like this.  And by the way, I don't laugh easily at movies.  But I laughed so hard at the end of this movie that my glasses steamed up.   
 1994 was a exceptional good year for hip-hop, with outstanding debut albums from The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, OutKast and many others, but in the middle of this, Common Sense second record unfortunate got highly overlooked, and it's first now in later years that Resurrection has got the attention it deserves. This is namely one of the most complete and perfect hip-hop album I know about.   I have always liked Common, and I'm sure people who love hip-hop will appreciate this one. He flows really good throughout the whole record. Common's wordplay sometimes seems more poetic, rather than rap lyrics; check out "Communism", "Thisisme" or "Watermelon" where he has classic lines like: ; "I express like an Interstate, hyper when I ventilate / My rap pieces penetrate and infiltrate your mental state / just to reiterate that I innovate / Bonin' broads when they men-estruate." As we go on there is genius references and double messages here, for instance on the self-biographic "Book of Life" where he says: "They say `become a doctor', but I don't have the patience/patients."   Common really shined in his role as young, hungry and a clever rapper, and when it comes to flows, he showed extreme flexibility. Other important elements used in this record are humor and self-irony and the explanation on why Common seems so comfort, properly lays in his tight collaboration with his childhood friends No I.D. and Ynot. They produced the whole record and had the opportunity to be creative with unnecessary pressure. The album has a jazzy sounding feel to it and we also get super tight cutting and scratching from Mista Sinister (X-Ecutioners) With classic songs like "I Used To Love H.E.R.", "Resurrection" and "Nuthin' To Do", this is undoubtedly Common best record, and all fans of the Chicago-rapper needs this in their collection of course.  If you like this record, don't sleep on his others. Common brings somethin' different to the table each time and never fails to impress me.  Peac

 This is truly a masterpiece just waiting to be discovered! I don't have one bad thing to say about this book. I've read it at least 6 times and it makes me cry every time. Wally Lamb is a beautiful writer and I highly recommend his other two books 
 This is a review of the Amazon Unbox Video version.  I saw this Hamlet a few years ago on VHS tape. It was a mesmerizing experience, and watched it straight through with a friend.  The only problem that I have (not 5 stars), is that the Amazon viewer that you must download is missing several navigation features that are sorely missed. Even iTunes will remember where you left off.  I think that they should have a scene selection menu, especially with a video of this length.  You should be aware that you might need to turn off your firewall software, Zone Alarm in my case, to complete the download. When I was only able to download 1/3, and then it wouldn't continue, my e-mail to Amazon was soon answered with a link to initiate a phone call with their help service. The trick was to delete the file and then to prompt it to download again with the firewall disabled.  This $9.99 price includes a format for mobile viewing, but the iPod is not supported, and iTunes doesn't offer this video.  Now, I have the Hamlet Variorum to complete the experience of enjoying and understanding some of the Elizabethan metaphors, eg, "chameleon's dish. 
 This is an excellent practical guide for making you a more effective school principal.  If you like and live this book, then you will also want to share "What Great Teachers Do Differently"  with your teaching staff. Anyone who has heard Todd Whitaker speak will be inspired by his down-to-earth methods and insights that make sense, show respect to students and motivate everyone to do an excellent job 
 These CDs are a pure pleasure for the ears. When we listen all this music we can remember all the images of the different films. It's fantastic: Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and the best of the best Star Wars. Listen this music in your car and feel the effects on you. It's magic!!!! John Williams is a real master.

 This book, along with Uta Hagen's "Respect for Acting" and any Stanaslavski, is the motherload of theater expertise 
 Book in perfect shape and came quick! Thank you so much! 
 This album is reminiscent of the 60's ballad style music. Great lyrics and good tunes - I enjoyed it immensely 
 This books offers a comprehensive overview of the China vs. World (Western / industrialized hemisphere) dynamics. Fishman intentionally does not get into the guessing game of Middle East/India factors in the equation but offers global trends that are relevant to everyone who is curious about the business world around them. What does it mean if a small fraction of Chinese can, or are willing, to do X? (Hint: a small fraction of one billion, in absolute terms, is an exceptionally large number of people nonetheless!) How will adding over a billion of people to the commercial world around us affect our lives and our countries? How can established companies make use of this new market?    If you want to know why, and how, China has ascended into such a prominent place in our lives, this book is a good place to start. And if you liked it, or want a more detailed look on the dynamics of Globalization as a whole, take a look at Globalization and Its Discontents by Joseph Stiglitz 
 The brilliance of the work on the early Bad Religion albums (Suffer, No Control and Against The Grain) is that it manages to be simultaneously delicate yet undeniably coarse. In terms of the lyrics, they can't get much more intricate, and yet they retain a hardened edge laced with a characteristically punk sense of discontent, which makes for a perfect balance. Vocally and musically the Bad Religion of Against The Grain are far more raw than they are they are currently, but there is still a sharpness which ensures that their raw edge does not make them come across as simply sloppy. Highlights include Anesthesia - with Brett doing what he does best and delving fearlessly into realm of the deeply troubled individual, and Greg furiously spitting social criticisms via his seamless polysyllabic approach in Get Off and Quality and Quantity. God Song is another gem which sits comfortably in the company of other Bad Religion tracks questioning the nature of religion, such as Chimaera and Generator, which are arguably some of their most effective songs. It's inconceivable that the boys will once again achieve the kind of punk perfection they did with this album, (and with Generator and Stranger Than Fiction) so no self-respecting punk should hesitate buying a copy of Against The Grain. It is a classic which effectively helped to define the genre of 90's punk rock 
 This album is the best example of what drum n' bass should sound like.  This is why Grooverider is the best.  Fork out the money and  get this double disc limited edition.  I got mine in France.  You will not be dissappointed 
 Convenient pocket map!  Included Tram routes and stops, which was very helpful. Key points of interest and attractions mapped as well 
 This is the Bible of self-help books. I've actually read it a couple of times and I'm sure I'll read it a few more. There is no other book that has benefited me more both personally and professionally. If you can only read one book, you can't go wrong with this one.   -- Nick McCormick, Author, Lead Well and Prosper 
 Many states have created specific standards for students to acheive throughtout their schooling.  This publication is extremely useful in helping to understand the intent of standards and what they look like in  the classroom.  Anyone that is working on science and math curriculum must  have a copy of this.  It is also very useful for new teachers to get  insight into exemplary content and practices.  This document also helps  people understand misconceptions that students develop over certain  concepts.  I've been using it continuously and have bought copies for many  people in my school district 
 A great read -- not your usual true love and battles and a happy ending -- this is a complicated tale of intrigue, treachery and conspiracy.  This is not a quick and easy read.  The "cast of characters" is large and complicated, it was well into 100+ pages before a grasped it all but well worth it.  The author provided a list of characters to refer to which I found very helpful.  All in all a great read about a period I knew little about.  As a side note, this book begins about the period that Katherine leaves off -- but is not related to that book and does not favor Henry of Bolingbrook that well.  I did love the final scene between Constance and Henry's Queen.  LOL. At the same time, I did enjoy reading about what become of Henry, as well as Katherine and John's two sons. Highly recommended 
 I have found Barclay's Daily Bible Study Guides of the New Testament the best in-depth commentary of the bible books.  He presents scholarly analysis in very easy to read passages.  Reading this book in particular greatly increased my understanding of Paul's extraordinary letters to Timothy and Titus on Christian leadership principles 
 "Dead Man Walking" deals with one nun's struggle to help a convicted death row inmate come to terms with his imminent execution. Writer-director Tim Robbins does something very difficult in this film, he makes us care about the unsympathetic character that Penn plays. Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn dominate the film in every aspect imaginable, they play a complicated chess match at times and eventually become close friends by the end of the picture. The fact that Sarandon and Robbins are openly against the death penalty in real life just adds to this film. Their strong opinion on the subject leads to an unforgettable motion picture that is made well and performed well by the two leads.  Of course, no film is 100% unbiased, especially when it comes to such serious issues as these, but I liked it. Features one of the most chilling and realistic scenes of an execution ever to be captured on celluloid. Based on the book by Helen Prejean (the real-life nun, who appears briefly outside the prison during a candlelight vigil scene) 
 Disjointed, disconnected, and shrouded in mystery all seem to be themes which surround drugs, whether one is speaking of their history, their effects, or their economics and regulation.  Sadie Plant attempts to connect and demystify many of the areas of this subject in her book Writing on Drugs.  Throughout the book, Plant tries to tie the various areas that fall under the subject of psychoactive drugs together with an underlying theme of the effect which psychoactive drug use has on authoring literature, but she fails to consistently connect this theme to all of the areas which she covers.  The result is that the quality of the book is greatly diminished, and starkly contrasts with her very apparent writing, researching, and connective abilities.  The book does provide useful insight into its subject, and should be enjoyable to readers interested in psychoactive drugs, modern sociocultural history, or literary creativity.  Through its various historical perspectives, it has provided me with a better understanding of psychoactive drugs and their wide-ranging effects, and in spite of the confusion which sometimes results from its inconsistent theme, I recommend this book to those readers with a little time and a desire for an information-packed introduction to psychoactive drugs 
 BOOM! - In late 2003 nearly 4,500 copies of this book were seized and confiscated by the Russian Secret Service (FSB) as they tried to make their way from Latvia printing presses into Moscow. And no wonder. This book focuses on how elements of the old Soviet regime sought to steer Russia away from the liberal reforms since the fall of the old USSR. The multiple apartment bombings which ripped across the country in 1999, killing hundreds, were more than suspicious. The 'terrorists' were condemned and the tragedies quickly used as an excuse to drag Russia into a second wretched war with Chechnya which continues to this day. The book's spotlight on the attempted bombing in Ryazan leaves little doubt as to who the enemy really was.  The book's translation from Russian into English is superb, but the sheer volume of facts and information combined with the never-ending plethora of Russian names makes for a challenging read if you are up to it. The book however is an excellent primer into the "nomenklatura" mindset of corruption, coercion, and intimidation, and should be studied and kept as a grim reminder of what is possible when criminal elements in the state pursue their own political agendas  - and how far they will go when the ends justifies the means in the political game of hardball.  Although the book is a study in extremism, there are still some associations to be made on a lesser level. Propaganda, intimidation, and internal investigations which never seem to come to fruition are just a few that come to mind. Despite the collapse of the USSR, Vladamir Putin, has placed many of his former KGB colleagues in positions of authority alongside him.  As Russians celebrate their "freedom" with the shutdown of the independent press, and genocide committed in Chechnya on a daily basis, I have little doubt that the people of Russia are told they are "winning" the war on terror. When the next 9/11 or Madrid like bombings occur, one where all the "evidence" appears overwhelming and points in only one direction, and yet the enemy, elusive as ever and always just out of arms reach, is never caught or convicted, perhaps you will think to read this book. 
 This is a particularly important book for two types of people to read: those who believe economic instability and inequality will lead capitalism to implode (they're wrong); and those who believe the economic engine of capitalism is running just fine, especially in the United States, and simply needs to be left alone by meddling do-gooders, thank you (they are wrong too). Neither view is realistic. Lester C. Thurow is quite well suited to explain why. He is practically a brand name on national television, known for making more sense of the economy than anyone could possibly expect from a dean at MIT. Although Thurow wrote this book in 1996, the trade deficit, the skewed distribution of revenue and the disparity between rich and poor continue to demonstrate the validity of his conclusion that fewer and fewer can get more and more for only so long. We highly recommend his insightful analysis, wishing only that Thurow proposed deeper solutions for the problems he so ably diagnosed 
 The concept is more or less the same as the standard monopoly. The product is good and is worth the price. Its nice to have the family members sit toghther and Njoy 
 A pretty good verson of their greatest hits especially thier first song,   and a good compilation of thier first 45s a even better picture from the  first album cover, poor Dave imagine trying to record an album with 3  chipmunks with minds of their own, its enough  for anyone  to just love  them all over agian once you have heard this cd , which proves once again  once a Chipmunk allways a chipmunk after all i have listened to them since  i was 3 and i am now 40 years old-Mar 
 I recently bought one of these to put in my wife's car. The kit is pretty complete and well organized; you could pick up most of the items over time and maybe save some money but I liked having the consolidated kit and particularly the air compressor. The bag itself is heavy nylon and has velcro on the bottom so it won't slide all over a carpeted area. 
 I read this book over forty years ago and learned well its argument against christianity, god, jesus, bigotry and any religion, which I have always despised since an early age. It seemed to me obvious that any firm and ultimate belief accepted with no criticism, with no hint whatsoever of a proof, would eventually generate instances of the opposite of what it intends to obtain.  Hence, for example, it is out of Christian love that the Holy Inquisition tortured and murdered people, and set the clock backward, for instance in Spain, which is only now recovering by allowing among others gay marriage - maybe one should live for some decades under the Catholic church to see what christianity is about. And this applies to any fanaticism, such as that of those who accused themselves of the worst crimes at the Moscow trials in 1936 etc.  But such argument is not truly based on logic, rather on Hegelian dialectics, which Russell despises. In other words, outside of logic it is perfectly possible to accept one statement and its contrary at the same time. Yet Russell would strongly object to that.  I can see why and sympathize: absolute beliefs were fought against with logic and reason until a few decades ago. This was necessary to get rid of obscurantism and that evil called "faith". But modern technology, some of which was contributed by Russell, puts this positivism into question: read for instance "Goedel, Escher and Bach" by Douglas Hofstadter, to see that there is an inherent flaw in logic, even abstract logic. In other words, mathematics ends up being close to an opinion, something that Russell's paradox anticipates.  But this is a philosophical flaw that does not mar the majority of essays, including that on sexual education and the one of that bigotry which prevented Russell from teaching at City College. And this, at a time when a hypocrite "statesman" vetoes stem cell research with exactly the same reasoning Bussell denounces, without minding murdering people worldwide and burning women and children alive.  As for the non-existence of Christ, it seems reasonable to assume that such a figure must have been perfected over the course of several centuries, and for this I suggest Friedrich Engels's "the origin of christianity" 
 This book made me want to crochet more (if that is possible).  I love the stand up book, makes it so much easier to use and the colors and designs are great 
  This review refers to The Great Illustrated Classic Edition(listed for ages 9-12) of "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley   I had to surf the various editions of Frankenstein to find this one, which is wonderfully adapted for older kids by Malvina G. Vogel and illustrated by Pablo Marcus Studio. There were many editions to go through and if you are interested in this one make sure you are on the page with the ISBN of:0866119817 (Playmore Publishers June 1993). You can enter the number in the book search. The cover has a fiery orange background with Frankenstein running in a wooded area.Only available at this time from the outside merchants, you may want to check with them by e-mail, to make sure which edition they are selling. The customer reviews as well as the editorial reviews seemed to be all lumped together, the children's issues along with the adult editions.    Malvina Vogel has done a fabulous adaption for younger readers to be able to enjoy this very frightening but most captivating classic. It is still the story we all love of Victor Frankenstein, who loved science and life. When a life of a loved one is lost, he vows to discover a way that no one will ever have to face the grief that death brings about. He works and studies furiously, to the point of obsession, until finally his labors prove it can be done. Invent life out of various body parts from corpses. But his creation turns out to be monstrous. A giant creature that seeks revenge on Victor for creating the hideous and terrifying being he has become. The path of the monster is covered with dead bodies, those of the people closest to Victor. Victor now has a new mission in life, to hunt the creature down and destroy him before the monster unleashes his vengeance on any more innocents.The monster is portrayed with feelings of hating himself for what he has done, and there are times, you may even feel a twinge of pity for him. The entire story unfolds wonderfully, and in a way, children will get caught up in, as Victor, near death and after chasing the monster through the iciest and coldest regions known to man, reveals for the first time to an explorer, also obsessed and risking lives, how his creation came to be. T   The books has fairly large print, excellent and somewhat scary illustrations with captions, on every other page.At nearly 240 pages it is a quick read and one that kids will be turning the pages enthusiastically. The school journal editorial here, say the illustrations are in color, however, in this edition they are black and white drawings. There is also a 2 page bio on Mary Shelley at the opening. I think the age group recommended here is pretty close(9-12), although 9 may be a little too young, just from a reading comprehension standpoint(Of course it depends on the child), and 12 may be a little young for a cut-off. I think even older kids, and even the parents reading with the child, will enjoy this adaption.  A great gift book for your favorite reader...enjoy...Lauri 
 I must admit I was surprised by how many people gave this book bad reviews. This book offers a biblical account of the return of Christ based on what we know from the Bible, especially from the book of Revelation. I was more surprised for the reasons that were used to justify those bad ratings. Since so many others have used this page to support their views, I have decided to do the same.  It doesn't matter what you what to believe, what only matters is what is true. The God that you believe in don't matter unless it is the true God. I believe in the God of the Bible, because I can know him through the words about The Word (Jesus Christ), and even if someone argues with me about my beliefs I can use the Bible to defend my beliefs. Some other people can only quote their opinions or expectations from their own head, having no other reference to go by.  A common argument I hear people try to use to put down the Bible is that God is not loving because He punishes sin and doesn't let everyone into Heaven. Well, he doesn't because He is also a holy God (Lev 11:44-45). Sin sickens him like nothing else (Ezekiel 23 compares our sins against God to a wife committing gross adultery with other lovers). God can't let us into his presence in our sinful condition and we can't work enough to earn our own forgiveness because we are too sinful (Romans 3:10-18, 23). God wanted to offer everyone a chance to go into His presence, so He sent His son, who because he is God and committed no sins, died for our sins on a Roman cross, a death so painful and incomparable to any other death they  needed to make a new word to describe it (excruciating). Jesus served as both the perfect priest and the perfect sacrifice in order to redeem all who would be saved through him. After 3 days in the tomb he rose from the dead in his own body. (The tomb was empty and the Roman guards hired to guard his tomb needed to create the lie that the disciples moved the stone and stole the body while they were sleeping. Who could sleep while a stone that had to weigh a least a ton was being moved.) God PROVED his love for us by taking the punishment that needed to be paid in order to buy our forgiveness (John 3:16). All you have to do to receive his righteousness is believe He is the Son of God and try to live according to his example and teachings. If you don't commit to that before you die, you have condemned yourself because you know the truth and refused it (Romans 1:18-20).  Despite the numerous arguments against the resurrection, none of them have enough logic to stand against the facts: (1) Christ did die on the cross because there is no way to fake death or swoon on a cross, you suffocate for that. And lest you forget the Romans stabbed him in the side of the chest with a spear after hours of relentless torture. (2) Peter, James, and John (3 of his 12 disciples and witnesses to his resurrection) were tortured and Peter and James were executed for their beliefs. If Christianity was a hoax, these guys would know it, and it is unthinkable that someone would die for a lie.  
 We are going through this book in our adult class at Church and R. C. has caused us to seriously think about what we really believe.  Wonderful!!! R. C. Sproul is a great writer and his teaching is very inspiring!!!  Wow!! 
 I read "The Creators" years ago as a teenager and rediscovered it when cleaning out the old book chest. I highly suggest opening ones mind with this work. "The Creators" is a how-to manual of human thought. It is not meant to be a thrilling adventure story. Boorstin takes you step by step through the imagery and imagination that dawned civilization. "The Creators" is for anyone who ever asked, "Why? 
 St. Louis skipper Tony La Russa took more heat from this book than any decisions or comments he made during his hall-of-fame managerial career.  Teaming with writer Buzz Bissinger, the book chronicles a 2003 three-game series the Cardinals had with the Chicago Cubs. The book weaves through the games through the eyes of La Russa, with outstanding pieces on his life and feelings about the game.  At least one player made it known to La Russa - through the proverbial baseball grapevine - that he would no longer autograph items for auction to benefit Tony La Russa's ARF due to several comments in the book.   There were other grumblings that made it to print in the national press - especially that Bissinger was attempting to debunk the theory of statistical analysis in the bestselling Moneyball - but Three Nights in August is a true account of what a manager is thinking at the moment something is happening on the field or in the dugout. That it was a true account puts the negative comments in perspective.  A reader will not get any closer to the action or gain a better appreciation on the life off the field of La Russa.     
 These Panasonic 8100 series shavers are excellent but you can save a bit with some shopping. This shaver is essentially the same as the PANASONIC ES8167A Arc Shaver (I believe only the color is different).   You can also find this on Amazon (I have a more complete review there). This was the model sold by a certain high-end catalog for $249 but can be purchased much less through Amazon. During Christmas, it was down to $99 and this included the Vortex cleaning station. I believe it is a bit more now, but still worth comparing to the 8168 if you want to save a bit 
 Though touted as an original "soundtrack" recording, this is in actuality an original "score" recording. The soundtrack was recorded with the 106 member Los Angeles Philharmonic. This disc is a re-recording with a 65 piece orchestra, helmed by composer Ernest Gold. However, all of the well remembered themes are here, and some bits of memorable dialogue. Also included are full versions of "Thirty One Flavors," and "You Satisfy My Soul" - the songs heard during the scenes with Dick Shawn and Barrie Chase. All in all, a fun listening experience of music which was as much a character in the film as any of the actors 
 As with any collection of short stories, there's some variance in quality here.  Several are three-star, a few are four-star, and two are five-star.  "The Long Watch" is a great character study, with emphasis on loyalty, duty, conscience, and ethics.  The title story, "The Green Hills of Earth" is a wonderful but tragic tale of heroism and bravery, reminiscent of what we saw in the NYFD on 9/11/01. These last two make the whole collection worth buying 
 In using her lover Alice as the narrator of something called an autobiography, Stein reveals that we can expect something unusual with this book. Of course, she delivers, turning ordinary events and words into a sometimes difficult but always fascinating prose narrative. One can easily see why so many artists and writers sought her company 
 A reality seeker long before it was cool, Craig Nelson is the ultimate travelling companion through the kind of forbidding destinations where "the airport wind sock really is a sock." Whether growling like a leopard with celebrity lookalike residents of Tanzania, good naturedly eating wet pine needles, or describing the symptoms of "tchotchke fatigue," Craig Nelson's singularly brilliant combination of wit and wanderlust is a camp classic. If Gogol collaborated with Indiana Jones, with a polish by John Waters, they might evoke Craig Nelson's LET'S GET LOST. Let's have more LET'S GET LOST--a series, a movie, a cookbook 
 My one year old daugher and I read this book at least once a day.  She loves the illustrations-like the space suit with pop beads for the oxygen line.  It is not too wordy, so she stays engaged, yet provides all the basic information about our solar system and planets.  She can now identify the pictures of the moon and the earth by name and knows that earth is where she lives.  An animal lover, she also likes that the cat journeys into space.  My daughter and I often look at the night sky, and she knows the ASL signs for moon and stars.  I think that is why she loves this book so much despite her young age. This is a wonderful introduction to basic astronomy, and has spurred me to order more books on space for us to share.   
 For those who do not know the story, the American Presidential election in 2000 was very close.  Democrat Al Gore received more popular votes than Republican George W Bush, but such elections are decided state by state, and the winner in Florida was to determine who would be President.  In Florida, more voters intended to vote for Gore than for Bush, but due to several irregularities, the vote was very close.  Close enough to require a mandatory recount.  Close enough so that either candidate could ask for a hand count of disputed ballots.  As it turned out, a complete recount of all ballots would have confirmed that Gore had won.  According to Florida law, such a recount should have been performed.  When a recount got under way, it grew increasingly clear that Gore might well win.  However, the Republican strategy (in a state where Bush's brother was the governor) was to refuse a recount or to delay any recount until the Presidential winner had to be announced.  If the Democrats protested, they would take the case to court.  To the Supreme Court.  And if they lost that case, they would simply have the Florida legislature declare Bush the winner of the state.  Either way, Bush would win an illegitimate victory.    Given that the initial count favored Bush, a Republican victory could not be prevented.  And even in the unlikely event that a complete hand count (including "overvotes") favored Bush, neutral observers would still note that a plurality of the Florida voters had tried to vote for Gore, and that Florida law was to favor the clear intent of the voters.  So the illegitimacy of the result was inevitable no matter how the hand count came out.  The only question was where the blame would rest.  Would it be on those in Florida who delayed the count?  On the Florida legislature?  On the Florida Courts?  Or on the Supreme Court?  Dershowitz explains how the blame wound up being applied, quite accurately, to the Supreme Court, which took a case and judged it purely on a partisan basis.  And he explains what the result of this mischief will be.  First, unlike a miscarriage of justice in a criminal case, which might get blamed on the jurors, the Supreme Court judges are there for life.  They'll be considered untrustworthy by a huge number of people for the rest of their lives, and that will make the Supreme Court less credible as long as any of them remain on it.  Dershowitz also says that it will call into much greater question the entire process by which Supreme Court judges are selected.  And of course, this entire affair has exposed the absurdities of our voting system to the world, which regards us with less esteem as a result.  Many Americans were annoyed with the Supreme Court simply because it picked someone other than the person they voted for. Others were angry because it picked the loser rather than the winner. However, Dershowitz is more concerned with the Supreme Court having showed partisanship at all, especially in a manner that threatens the carefully established checks and balances among branches of government so carefully laid out in our Constitution.    Finally, Dershowitz reminds us that the authority of the Supreme Court "rests on public acceptance of its status as a nonpartisan arbiter of law."  Judicial integrity gets built up slowly and in this case was squandered quickly.  This book does an excellent job of showing just how dismally the Supreme Court performed here 
 One of my relatives is going through a divorce. I sent him a copy of this book, which I first read years ago. It makes an excellent gift book to both show concern and provide help for someone going through a hard or down time in life 
 Yes, as the prior review mentions, the road info may not be accurate... but there's a lot more to this book.  I live in Lisbon and recommend it to all our visitors as it has excellent info on making your way through Sintra, Belém, Tavira, etc.  If you're a first-time visitor looking for insider-type tips on the "highlights" of Portugal, this book is worth considering.  (It is limited to a few key Portuguese cities/sites, so don't expect an overview of everything in this beautiful country. 
 Another funny girly story from Sophie Kinsella.  The heroine is a work-obsessed, intelligent, perfectionist, go-getter career gal -- a female archetype that I could totally relate to (smile!)  She makes an (apparently) fatal mistake which sends her into a tailspin.  She lands herself in a bizarre and funny predicament.  I liked this book because it shows how we women can transform ourselves into whatever we set our minds to 
 I thoroughly enjoyed Cheryl's book and highly recommend it to any mom working from home or wishing to. She tells us of her personal experiences dealing with working from home and raising a family at the same time. A great weekend read 
 I really enjoyed this book. If you're interested in Race,Class, and Gender studies within the context of Colonialism and it's impact on Western Medicine, this book is for you. It's original in the sense that the author uses well written and popular fiction books by famous women of color novelists. She looks at popular works such as Beloved, Bluest Eye, Salt Eater and Almanac of the Dead by analysing them within the context of the politics of medicine and history of oppression in Western Society. It's and engaging brilliant piece of work that I simply could not put down. Anyone who is a practitioner of Medicine (physicians as well as psychiatrists and pscyhoanalysts) who is sincerely interested in understanding the social impacts of institutionalized racism within Western Medical world will enjoy this work 
 The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse is a groundbreaking suite, full of intriguing new sounds and grooves. Ellington didn't fade into predictability and mundanity in his last years; instead, his compositions became more and more original and exciting. This suite has rocking, swinging, waltzing grooves that, though seemingly disparate, work together and illustrate the theme stated in the Duke's spoken introduction to the suite: to show that "the whole world is going Oriental, and that no one will be able to retain his or her identity... not even the Orientals." Duke doesn't leave his standbys behind, though. The phenomenal playing of Ashby, Carney, Jones, and the rest of the Orchestra keeps The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse firmly rooted in virtuosity, even when playing to new grooves, melded with African, Asian, and Australian rhythm and sound.  On a personal note, this is one of my favorite CDs. Aside from the remarkable music, it gets bonus points for the spoken introduction, at the beginning of the "Chinoiserie" track. Audio notes give the listener a greater understanding of the CD, especially one with a single focus, like this one. 
 This book is so much more than a novel - for the average weekend golfer, there's also a lot of little lessons in here, for use both on and off the golf course.  I read this, The Foursome and Scratch in less than 3 weeks with the latter 2 offering yet more thoughtful insight into the game of and what motivates us to play it.  Eddie Caminetti is my new hero 
 A realistic view of the black american movement from someone on the inside 
 I own a small business and I am looking to find more clients. This book is a must have for anyone who wants to offer services to businesses. I have already found this book to informative, simple to understand, and it has given me new skills to market my business without all the expense.  Although I haven't done this for 28 days, I already have some leads on new clients just by doing some of the steps mentioned. Any one who offers a service related business should read this book. Truly a lifesaver! Thank 
 What can I say after the third re-reading. The book is lyrical, funny, and informative.  And, of course, timely to these days.  Principally, though, it is helluva read 
 With the release of Jasper Fforde's fourth title in the Thursday Next sci-fi/fantasy series, readers will be treated to the culmination of the alternative Earth that the author has spent three books building. In "Something Rotten," the options for direction for the series are fully realized as the alternate Earth of 1988 and the world of Fiction are completely in place.  When last we left the intrepid Thursday Next, she had just saved the world of Fiction from yet another villain intent on its destruction. Pregnant and with her husband erased from history by the evil Goliath Corporation, Thursday's finally given birth to a son, Friday, who at two year old only speaks in Lorem Ipsum (a good example of the craziness of Fforde's vision.) Deciding that her time overseeing the purity of novels has worn thin, she returns to Earth and winds up becoming: * The target of an assassin * The coach of her town's professional croquet team * The thorn in the side of a hypnotic politician who is actually fictional * The hostess to Hamlet, Prince of Denmark * The on-again, off-again wife to her exterminated, unexterminated husband * The finder of a live clone of William Shakespeare * The friend of Neanderthals everywhere * Dead--twice * The holder of the secrets of the apocalypse * The once-again savior of the planet  If you think that's about three books in one, well that pegs "Something Rotten." Fforde packs this book so full of plot and sub-plot that readers must juggle all those narrative balls at once. That Fforde can bring all this together at the end shows that his mastery of his world has grown since the start of this series, "The Eyre Affair."  While not as inventive as his previous book, "The Well of Lost Plots," Fforde's world-building is largely done, so "Something Rotten" can focus on the story and not on backstory--that's a big plus. Longtime readers of the series will find that this fourth book finally illuminates some of the backstory that existed even in the first book. For instance, we finally get to see who Millon de Floss is and get a better look at the genetic experiments that have resulted in an England overrun with mammoths, dodos, and Neanderthals.  All the typical humor that we've come to expect from Fforde is here and he's done well picking up the mantle of Douglas Adams. Someone has to write nutty British sci-fi and Fforde is doing it about as well as anyone right now. And while "Something Rotten" is a terrible place for new readers to jump into the Thursday Next books, for fans of the series this is probably the most satisfying of his books.  Enjoy 
 I was pleased with the presentation and quality of the dramatization.  The BBC series is sure better that just having someone read the book on a tape!  The BBC series seems to be the best in conveying the sense of mystery in  each of Conan Doyle's works.  I find each of the actors make truly fine  presentations which are easy to follow and track closely to the printed  text.  When one listens closely, each set of words tie in to the ultimate  conclusion.  And after hearing each presentation a few more times, you pick  up on the nuances that lead you to the correct conclusion 
 I love this movie. The story is great, Kelly Sheridan did such a good job on the voices,not to mention how pretty the barbies are! The story is about two identical girls. A princess,and a pauper. The first time I saw it,I was like okay, I thought ,I like the other barbie movies MUCH better. This has to much singing in it. I'll watch it anyway I've got nothing better to do.And WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO STOP SINGING?!? But after awhile I liked it,I LOVED IT! PLEASE, DO NOT MISS IT!!! 
 As it often happens in De Lint's universe, an "ordinary" human (in this case a young girl) encounters creatures and elements from the secret magic/supernatural world that sorrounds us.  Imogene has recently moved to Newford with her family, and she discovers something very odd about her new highschool; apart from the usual bullies, snobs and geeks there's a boy ghost drifting about in the school corridors - and he appears to be watching her! Imogene becomes curious, and along with her new friend Maxine she discovers a world she never knew existed! It's fascinating and strange, but also very very dangerous!  It's a story about friendship, the relationship between Imogene and her - very opposite! - new friend Maxine is well described. It's a story about courage, and the stuff you can do if you stand together to achieve something, but most of all is a story about faeries, magic (good as well as evil!) and about "finding yourself". There are cool elements - like Imogene's childhood imaginary(?) friend coming alive to help her - and the story is well paced. One of De Lint's better novels in my opinon. If you like it 'I can recommend his various volumes of Newford short stories 
 I first saw this movie as a child and wanted it to have it in my DVD collection.  60% of my DVD's have been purchased through AMAZON, it was the only place I could find it.  I'm thankful for Amazon again 
 of the book "Revolutionizing Product Development", same authors. The chapters are segmented according to the logic of the previous mentioned book. It is worth mention the chapters about the application of the "Aggregate Project Plan" and "Structuring the Development Funnel". These chapters tell us about the pitfalls and gave some useful proposition on how to solve it. The examples are OK. It could be a bit difficult to undestand how the process works without the previous reference cited before. There is also some "study questions" that suggests that this book is also for training people on Innovation. Very good idea indeed 
 I was required to buy "Television: Critical Methods and Applications" for my Film and Television class, and it is by far the most interesting text book i've read so far in my college career. It addresses advanced concepts in language that is easy to follow and understand. 
 I read Lady Chatterly's lover for the first time in high school, and to be honest, it was more for the juicy bits than anything else. Five years later, though, it was an aside from a professor during a  lecture on Nabokov that convinced me to pick it up again.  This was the first novel that I'd read where I truly felt an inner conflict brewing - but in a good way. Lady Chatterly's Lover, though banned for its immorality on its publication, is a book that will force a person to question their own morality and moral judgements, and perhaps rethink them.   It is a story of a young woman married to an older man who is confined to a wheel chair due to a war wound. Her husband and she have a respectful relationship, though she does not love him, and though he may love her, he is not particularly attentive. To cure her boredom and satisfy her libido, she turns to adultery. Her first lover is a egotistical Irish writer, but she leaves him quickly over "performance" issues. She finds herself attracted to Oliver, the gamekeeper on her husband's estate. They continue the affair under the nose of her husband, who, afraid that she will leave him, pretends not to notice.   Lawrence's writing is sublime, to say the least. His descriptions  of the estate are picture perfect, and each scene is told almost cinematically. The characters are perfectly developed; you can feel Lady Chatterly's inner turmoil in the beginning of the novel as she copes with caring for her husband and her unsatisfied libido, without any social outlets but her husband's friends. As she begins her affair with Oliver, you notice how that tension that she held is slowly released - and how her husband, paralyzed and coping with a wife who spends less and less time with him, absorbs this tension. Beautiful read.  
 This Review is about the Essential Codex Mendoza, not the full blown expensive four volume edition: This book is totally fabulous!!  Though it might not have all of the original Codex in its original color( a few color represantaions have made it in though), it does have all the Codex in black and white with copious explanations.  In my opinion this is one of the more informative books about Aztec life out there, and being able to see the picutures of the codex(even if some are just black and white) is fabulous. I confess that I haven't read the whole thing but have thoroughly enjoyed leafing through it and learning fascinating tidbits on Aztec life.  This book is the coolest!! 
   Exactly what the 'dogs' did when they burst onto the scene in 2003 with their debut 'Savin Hill' (got my nod for best album of 2003), and the boys don't seem to be slowing down one bit with 'Back to the World' in 2005.  Once in awhile a band comes along where everything they put out is a 'must own', and the Street Dogs are that kind of band.  I'm not a professional music reviewer, so I'm not going to go off and give you a million reasons, why or why not to purchase this album, it should be a no brainer. If you dug Savin Hill(if you didn't, there is something wrong with you), you'll dig Back to the World.  And if you ever get a chance to see these guys live, DO IT, They're worth 10 times the price of admission 
 I have all of the books in this series (excluding the newest in hard cover), as do most of you. I have read your reviews and agree with some but disagree with others. I have a wonderful time reading these books, whether excellent or not so excellent. It seems, though, that most reviewers believe the interaction between Eve and Summerset is because of intense dislike on the part of these two. I simply don't believe that to be the case. I think they actually like and respect each other immensely but find it difficult to put aside their aloofness. Therefore, they play off each other with ascerbic wit and sarcasm and find this to be within their comfort zones. There is no doubt Rourke derives great amusement from this repartee.   As for Ms. Roberts, her writing knows no parallel. This series is her best, in my opinion. 
 I LIKE THIS MOVIE. EVERYTIME I WATCH THIS MOVIE I WANT TO CRY. DUSTY SPRINGFIELD SINGS THE SONG FOR THE MOVIE" KISS ME GOODBYE" AND SHE SINGS IT VERY WELL. I ENJOY THIS MOVIE AND I LIKED SALLY FIELD,JAMES CAAN, AND JEFF BRIDGES THEY ALL DID A GOOD JOB WITH THEIR ACTING I LIKED THIS MOVIE IT IS A LOVE STORY AND IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO LIKE LOVESTORIES 
 I had one of these years ago and just recently purchased a new one I can say without hesitation that the product really works.  Its great for martial artists, particularly those whose arts rely on grabs, chokes, and need strength in the hands.  These are also good for anyone needing general purpose finger strength, I havn't used one in ages but my friends still say I have some of the strongest hands they've seen and I attribute this entirely to the use of the eagle catcher 
 If Dover doesn't reprint this four volume series, they are missing the boat.  Or Dragonships 
 I am a personal trainer and this info is very good for anyone working with older adult, I recommend it with no hesitation.  I am french please excuse my grammar!!!  Thank 
 I teach 12 and 13 year-olds and have found I have less explaining of words to do with the CEV than with my previous favorite, the NIV.  The side notes are useful for them and the reference to certain maps and other mini-articles is a good learning tool.  The pictures are of good quality and their captions enhance the theme.  However, I miss an extensive cross-reference and concordance of the NIV study Bible when I prepare for leading an adult's Bible Study.  The adult participants are very impressed with the CEV and don't notice the lack of references.  And, there is no need for weight-lifting after taking this Bible out 
 Last month I went to drop my car at my mechanics and my radio was playing the Cover Girls-Greatest Hits. My mechanic said, "LADY YOU GOT CLASS!!! WHERE DID YOU GET THAT CD? MY WIFE ONLY LISTENS TO BRITNEY SPEARS". I love that CD so much! It takes me back when I was a teenager at New York going to Hearthrob's, The Tunnel, Emerald City, and the Paladium. Boy!Those were the great days! I also have the collection of the FREESTYLE-Megamix. Worth buying when you are a true freestyle freak, lol 
 I got this book as a gift, right after it was published in the late eighties. Since then, I've read & re-read it more times then I can count. It's just as much fun on the umpteeth read as it was on the first.  The entire Mick-Jerry-Bianca-Halston-Studio 54 entries are hilarious. It wouldn't bother me a bit if his diary was published in its entirety someday. I'd read all of the doggone 20,000 pages!  It was shocking when Andy died unexpectedly in 1987. Every time I read the book, it's like a clock ticking in my head as time, unbeknownst to him, runs out, and far too soon 
 This book by Oscar-winner Haing Ngor is deep, personal, and insightful. One can learn much about the character of the people of Cambodia and what led to the horrible genocide that the people committed to themselves. Read this book and travel to the depths of human psychology, depravity, and struggle. My parents were children of the Killing Fields, and I was born in the refugee camp that you will see Ngor work at in the book. His story was emotionally stirring.. 
 I'm a senior and I never embroidered.  I started looking at books for instructions and a friend of mine owns a copy of this book.  I borrowed it and after just a few minutes, I knew I had to own a copy.  I love the step by step instructions with pictures. The book gives you alternative names to stitches, hints and definitions of what the stitches can be used for.  The details are amazing, and each page is an education.  I'd recommend it to all beginners as well as the experienced embroiderer 
 I think this movie was great!  The actors were fitted well and the story line exciting, not just Another Plane Movie 
 Tom Berenger, Corbin Bernsen, Charlie Sheen, and Wesley Snipes star in this fun film about the woeful Cleveland Indians baseball team and how a group of misfits and castoffs came together to make the Indians pennant winners again.  Berenger stars as Jake Taylor, a former all-star catcher who has been toiling in the Mexican league.  He gets a call from the Indians GM to come to spring training to be the team captain and help mentor the younger players.  These players include Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes), a speedy outfielder who can only hit pop flys, Rick Vaughn (Charlie Sheen), a flame-throwing pitcher fresh out of the California penal league who possesses a blazing fastball but has no control, and Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert), a hard-hitting Cuban who defected for religious freedom.  He can crush fastballs, but nothing else.  He also has a shrine in his locker with an idol named Jobu. Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) is a high-priced third baseman who cares more about his investment portfolio than he does about baseball.  Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitten) has inherited the Indians after the death of her owner-husband.  A former showgirl, she is determined to move the team to Miami, where she will cash in on several perks from the city.  But to do this, the team's attendance must fall below a certain level.  Determined to get what she wants, she begins taking things away from the team, such as whirlpools, and even their private plane.  Soon the team is travelling to games by bus.  However, the team has Lou Brown (James Gammon) as their manager.  He is determined to make the Indians winners, regardless of what Rachel does.  The season starts off slowly for the team, and they are in their traditional last place position.  But the GM lets Lou in on Rachel's scheme, and things begin to change.  The players realize that the only option they have other than becoming free agents or being released is to win it all.  And that's what they set out to do.  I'm a big baseball movie fan, and this movie is one of my all-time favorites.  The story is excellent (being a Cubs fan, I'm glad the producers didn't pick them as their team to use), and the acting is tremendous. The choice of Bob Uecker as Indians announcer Harry Doyle was a stroke of genius.  His announcing and one-liners really add a great dimension to the film.  Rene Russo does a good job as Jake's on again, off again girlfriend Lynn Wells.  Its fun to watch their ups and downs throughout the movie.  There's even a take-off on the then-popular "do you know us?" American Express Card commercials.  I give this teriffic movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how a bunch of no-names and has-beens bond together for one magical season to become winners 
 One of the best films I have ever seen ---long - but worth i 
 the book was a mind opener.  I never knew to much about where cut flowers came from and now i know and im glad.. the book was very informant and well written.. my only concern was it got a little rambling in the middle, but stay with it and the end will give you a nice surprise.  
 i really like this tv program long long ago. i bought the first season. then i went on the internet and bought the other two seasons. 
 This devotional is well rounded, and very complete for day to day study. You can take a half hour or as long as you desire and it is truly food for your soul. I look forward to my devotional time and am so excited by the growth this book encourages 
 Having used the Supra locks which I like a lot, I found the Master Lock key safe and tried it out.  It is VERY heavy duty, and holds much more than Supra.  The combo is easy to change (takes seconds) and it is VERY weather proof.  I like it better than the Supra except you must leave the combination dialed in to close it.  Someone could see it.  The Supra does not show which button(s) were pushed.  All things considered, I will be buying the Master Lock in the future. 
 I read this book many years ago and to this day several of the short stories stick in my mind. So when looking for a good book for my wife to read, I thought this was the perfect choice. Unfortunately, I didn't have a copy. So I was overjoyed to see this book being reprinted and eagerly ordered a copy.  Look for "Who Goes There" which is the short story the movie "Thing" was based upon 
 I found this book to be an engrossing tale of the personalities and technologies that resided in Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)--some invented there, some developed more fully there, and many only being produced by other companies due to Xerox's short-sightedness. The laser printer, the mouse, windowing systems and overlapping windows, bitmapped graphics, computer processing of video images, the personal computer, Ethernet, email.  Hiltzik does a good job of presenting many faces in a large cast of characters and describing the alliances and clashes within Xerox PARC (and between PARC and the rest of Xerox). Of particular note is the greater detail on the story of Steve Jobs visits to PARC and how they occurred (Xerox was briefly an investor in Apple), in far more detail than has been given elsewhere (e.g., in Levy's Insanely Great) 
 If you're looking for speakers to flood your patio with nice background sound without raising the ire of your neighbors, the Audio Source LS400's are a great choice.  They are not the most powerful, but they provide excellent bacground music at a GREAT price.  Our home builder offers these same products through their installer, at about twice the price 
 This label maker works really well.  Here are the pros: 1) Can change style of text (bold, shadow etc) 2) M tapes are very cheap compared to other Brother series of tapes 3) You can print on two lines (so say your name and phone number) but the text is fairly small - good for labeling personal property 4) Very easy to use - I never looked at the manual  Cons: 1) Uses a bit of extra tape on the ends 2) Only 2 lines max 3) Tapes only come in 1/2 and 3/8 inch widths 
 I bought this toy for my son a year ago, when he turned 4.  He LOVES it!  Especially since Pirates of the Carribean came out.  He spends hours playing with the Island and the Battle Castle, which we also have and love.    There were a few complaints by previous buyers as to the amount of pieces and the fact that it falls apart.  There are a lot of small pieces that are accessories that we put in a little "treasure box" that we bought from Walmart. (Just a $3 box with a little buckle lock.)  Our son stores the small pieces in there and he hasn't lost any small pieces in a year.  When he wants to fully accesorize his island, he pulls them out and sets them up. (But he is a pretty organized kid.)  We love the accessories because it adds so much to the adventure.  The island is pretty compact if you follow the instructions and use the little 3 prong footers.  If you don't, it will fall apart fairly easily. Our son can pick the entire island up and carry it to another room without it falling apart.   NOTE:  If your child trashes things a lot or likes to hit, bang and smash their toys, then this is probably NOT the toy for them.  But if they take care of their toys and have a vivid imagination, this IS the toy for them.    All in all, we LOVE this toy and would definitely purchase it again!  He got the Battle Castle the same year (as stated earlier) and we just got the Glow in the Dark Pirate Ship which he LOVES!  We're going to get the Pirate Raider and Glow in the Dark Shark & Skeleton next.

 As a non-American it is astonishing to read the distortions of Layard's argument presented in several of the reviews of this book, distortions suggesting that many Americans view any innovative thoughts on government policy and taxation as "communism". Layard shows that unfettered economic growth and scientific change has led to not just rising incomes but to social breakdown in the form of increased divorce rates, crime and alcoholism. These things make people unhappy!! Poor mental health makes people more unhappy than just about anything.Critics of this book should themselves attempt to answer the question, why, above a certain level, do rising incomes not increase happiness rather than rant on about its "communistic" ideas 
 How to be a part of real Rock History without being a musician, singer, producer or someone in the music business? Answer: Make a movie as this one. Almost every serious Rock fan and rock star must have seen this movie or if they haven't, they had better see it before they go out and give another interview. Believe me, there are bands and performers who still talk and give interviews like Spinal Tap did in this movie. This movie is made for these guys. Like me, if you have watched countless interviews of rockstars, popstars and movie stars you cannot do without this classic. The Lead guitarist was my favourite. I could give him an Oscar for his brilliant performance. If Jimmy Page used a bow on his guitar you must wait and see what the lead guitarist of  Spinal Tap does.  These guys literally become Gods by the way they poke fun at Rockstars and their mannerisms particularly when it comes to giving interviews and playing live. In fact this movie is so well made that it puts to shame serious rockumentaries made for real rockstars and bands.   One of the most famous lines from the movie apart from "This one goes to 11" is when the band is asked about one of their deceased members for which the band mates tell the interviewer (played by the director Rob Reiner himself) that the bandmate died of choking on vomit but they didn't know whose vomit!  Hilarious and highly entertaining you'll love this DVD with tons of goodies which are worth the price of the DVD alone. There is so much extra footage on the DVD that is seems like Spinal Tap 2.    The extras are as good as the original movie. I couldn't stop laughing when the band goes to the zoo and near the chimps cage when they are talking their usual ridiculous lines they say things like "'..chimps can't talk but can use computers.." and stuff. You wonder how brilliantly the actors have come together to pull off something like this.     Neatly packaged even the liner notes are funny. Almost every move made and every line spoken is worth being labelled funny. One of the songs even caught my attention though the lyrics were insane.  A classic you cannot afford to miss 
 My kids love this book.  Only drawback is the lack of pronunciation guide, it's been a while for me...  Maybe it's in the teacher's guide, which I don't have.  
 I am a teacher in a daycare and I work with children who come from different backgrounds and cultures all over the world. I have probably read this book fifty times and it still makes me cry. The kids think I'm nut 
 get this one! I was forced into watching it by my girlfirend but after only maybe 10-15 minutes I was really interested in seeing what happened next. I have been forced to watch a few other romance films in my time and this one I actually enjoyed. If your girl has given you a list of romance movies she wants for gifts and you know your going to end up having to watch them with her, do yourself a favor and get this 
 My 2 1/2 year old loves this book!  We have taken it out of the library so many times, I have finally decided it is time to own it!  I think she identifies with the sweet kittens who get into trouble but then make amends  and get to eat the pie after all.  Both toddlers and preschoolers will love  this beautifully illustrated book 
 This was a cute movie.  My daughter loves to watch it over and over.  She can relate a little more with the Bratz babyz than the older Bratz 
 Primarily, this book teaches the proper way to write hiragana and katakana.  It excels at this because it gets you to practice, practice, practice and practice some more. Personally, I made photocopies of all the practice pages so I could more easily practice.  Secondarily, it covers basic pronunciation, reading, and writing sentances.  Just the basics, concepts are explained simply and it provides a good platform for further study.  I'm certain the authors intended readers to study other books for these skills.  Its one minor drawback is not including info on why machine-made characters sometimes look significantly different than hand-written characters.  
 This is an absolutly awesome book. Right away I was able to easily understand why some of my group policies weren't working and explained why it takes so long for some PC's to get assigned software. I highly reccommend getting this book if you are going to be creating Group Policyies. It's a must have!! 
 This book is well written, so that any layman can understand and use the info. it contains. I am pleased with it 
 I have been trying to learn the constellations forever...and have used lots of different resources to do so.  This is it..the intuitive and delightful presentation has fired up the entire family and we are all learning from age 4-46.  Great 
 Stephanie finally is getting comfortable in her own skin. In this episode, she decides that being a bail bondsman is not really "her." She's smart enough to know, however, that she doesn't know what is really "her." By the end of the book, she realizes that the problem is her zany life, and that she was actually pretty good at her job. It's about time. There are plenty of jokes, some of them the standard blown up cars, Grandma Mazur with a gun, etc., but the joke is no longer Stephanie. On a number of occasions she takes independent action, trumping the police, basically solving the murder, and dispensing a moderate amount of violence where appropriate. Good for her. The series had grown a little tired. Good to see that it's gotten a second wind 
 There's a good book for a good price. Review the technology of hearing impaired devices without parciality and with a clear language. 
 While on maternity leave from Cambridge University and with her husband away handling a legal matter in Los Angeles, Professor Cassandra James meets her neighbor actress Melissa Meadows and her spouse Keith Kingleigh.  Melissa and Cassandra share an affinity since both recently gave birth prematurely.  Kevin is going to direct a production starring Melissa.  He asks Cassandra to adapt the Victorian drama East Lynn, which she agrees to do.  As opening night beckons, Cassandra notices the cast seems extra nervous.  Later an anxious Melissa calls Cassandra believing that someone is stalking her.  Cassandra tries to calm her down.  The next day Melissa fails to appear for a rehearsal so Cassandra goes to visit her.  Melissa is gone without a word, but abandoned her six month old baby that she had shown so much love.  With her own fussy infant at her side, Cassandra wonders what happened to her new friend while unable to contact Stephen, dealing with the abrupt arrival of her first husband, and Detective Sergeant Vickers suspecting the professor killed the actress.  STAGE FRIGHT, the second Professor James tale (see MURDER IS ACADEMIC), is a fabulous amateur sleuth mystery that builds up the suspense slowly so that the reader like the heroine suspects everyone's motives.  Either foul play occurred or Melissa had played the role of a loving mother, but Cassandra cannot find a motive for either scenario while the evidence points towards her so that even the audience will believe she harmed or murdered the actress.  This is a fantastic English mystery in the Christie tradition.  Harriet Klausner 
 George is hilarious!  It's just as funny each time I watch it.  Love it 
 Trying to find great socks for a men's size 15EEEE foot is never easy.  These socks are absolutely great.  They feel good and come out of the wash nice.  They are a recommended buy for a big guy! 
 The Fellowes Gel Wrist Rest is very comfortable, and I award it five stars because it provides the best wrist support one can reasonably expect to acquire and keep.  True, it's pure joy to lay your keyboard across your lover's slim back and support your wrists on those smooth, firm, yet supple cheeks.  But a breakup is a high price to pay for a few minutes' pleasure, and unless your love is very giving and patient, I recommend the Fellowes Gel Wrist Rest instead.  It's not as beautiful, not at all, but it'll feel almost as good under your wrists 
 I LOVE this movie.  This movie is an blue print for all the revenge horror movies we have now.  Its a slasher movie with real characters.  Most slasher movies have characters who are over the top with whatever the sterotype that movie character is, and look like J Crew models lol.  With the looks of the cast, I can tell that the studio didnt do a tight cast call for the roles in this movie.  Unlike most slasher movies, I didnt want the whole cast to die, even though sooner or later they would have to face their fate.  Even Wendy was a pretty tame mean girl compared to some of other B***** in the newer slasher movies. They were actually likeable kids, that happened to make one little mistake LOL.  The ending sequence was one of the best and saddest I ever seen in horror movie ever (even inched passed "Carrie").  Main reason for that was one of the songs "fade to black".  Listen to the words and they actually follow the story line.  Yes, the soundtrack made this movie.  Every time you hear music it fits that scene perfectly.  I wonder what would happen if you did the dance number that jamie did at your prom. LOL I just wish it comes on tv more. I just ordered the dvd, and I heard word that a remake of this classic is underway sometime coming up REAL SOON. 
 Nova are a research facility that have just constructed five robots designed for war. After a lightning storm, their Number 5 leaves the group and heads into town, realizing he's alive. Is he alive? That's up to Stephanie Smith (Ally Sheedy) and Number 5's creator (Steve Gutenberg) to find out.  I found it a bit hard to sit through when I was a kid, but "Short Circuit" isn't too bad. The robot is cute and the plot is fairly engaging. Worth a look for fans of robots 
 This compilation of women's stories varies wildly from the single to married women, from traditional to anything but.  You will not have heard of most of the contributors, but the pieces are well written and honest.  It was encouraging to read stories that held bits of truth about my own life, and shed light on mistakes to avoid and risks to take.  I'm glad I bought it, and I will probably pick it up from time to time when I need female encouragement 
 Salon Kitty has good actors and plenty of erotic stage production. The elaborate costumes with nazi symbols all over them did a good job in conveying the nazi era and mind-set. The feeling of madness, anger, depression and fear was present in all the characters. The need for power and being a slave to lust was also conveyed very well. Altogether, an accurate account of decending into a living hell 
 This book was an easy read and really motivated us to contract our home on our own.  Has some great suggestions on saving money and planning a home build.  Read it before you get too far on your project.  Very enlightening 
 The workouts are very good, but as a previous reviewer stated-it is very 90's. I wish that I would have known that before I bought it. All in all, you will get a great workout 
 As a grandmother I find this easy and quick to warm bottles or baby food jars.  Heats in very little time and easy to adjust temperature by adding or removing water.  Wish I had this when my kids were little 
 If you look at every Three 6 album from Mystic Stylez to Most Known Unknown, each one is a little more polished and a little less raw than the last.  This is the one that gets the rawness/polish balance just right.  It still has that underground dangerous feel, but the production is far better than the very lo-fi Mystic Stylez.  The later albums Chapter 2 and When the Smoke Clears are great albums, but they are too clean sounding.  This is the first one that should be on your list 
 While it is not without it's flaws (particularly, the fact that it strangely tips it's hand so early as to the killer's accomplice), "Theatre of Blood" is not only one of the great revenge movies every made, but one of the best, if unorthodox, examples of Shakespeare on film.  Vincent Price, in the role of a lifetime, plays hack British actor Edward Lionheart, who goes to extremes to get revenge upon a group of smug theatre critics who denied him a Best Actor award.  Price is obviously having a glorious time as Lionheart (and his snippet as Shylock is so wonderful it makes one wish he had gotten the chance to do the entire play on film), but the film also features an incredible supporting cast as the critics, all of whom wryly represent one of the seven deadly sins each.  On top of that, there's the beauteous Diana Rigg in her prime.  Some of the murders are overly gory, one or two are overly spoofy, but even that can't detract from a terrific black comedy featuring truly stellar, Oscar-worthy work by Vincent Price.  There was talk of a remake in recent years, but really...who's out there today that could pull this off 
 We all enjoyed this chimp (bucky).  Wish it was softer, but overall would buy again.  
 This was my first book in Linda Barnes' Carlotta Carlyle series and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Carlotta is similar in ways to Stephanie Plum.  In this book she follows her "little sister" Paolina to Colombia where she believes Paolina's Father may have taken her following Paolina's disappearance from Boston.  I was totally taken in by Carlotta's adventures and the unravelling of mysteries. I look forward to Linda Barnes' next book to see what happens to some of the enticing characters she introduces us to 
 I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.   A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.   Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!   Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.   Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.   I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat "Bite me!"   I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it.  
 David G. Hartwell has been a rather well-known editor in the science fiction field for quite a long time, and in Visions of Wonder he collects quite a few fine stories and authors, which include such contemporary luminaries as Lucius Shepard, James Patrick Kelly, Greg Bear, Terry Bisson, and Nancy Kress, along with an older crowd consisting of Brian Aldiss, Algis Budrys, Kate Wilhelm, and Philip Jose Farmer. A series of essays (my favorite of which, probably, is Samuel R. Delany's) is also included in this book, which examines the state that science fiction was in, is now in, and postulates various theories about what science fiction might become in the future. Does the collection work as a whole? Generally speaking (with a few rough areas), yes. With standout stories such as "Mr. Boy" by the very excellent J.P. Kelly, this anthology includes some very interesting and genre-spanning fiction, and, in the end, is an anthology that I am very willing to recommend 
 I thought this book was wonderful!!  Susan Senator did a very thorough job and I will use this book throughout my son's life.  She gives excellent references to web sites that are extrememly helpful.  She also provides the reader with an excellent check list of what to look for when reviewing your child's IEP/school plan.  I love how personal this book is because you know the author truly understands what it is like to live with autism in your family and how to be proactive and positive.  Senator is also very honest and realistic about the highs and lows of dealing with autism.  Two thumbs up for a well written and resourceful book! 
 I loved this book so much that I am not even sure what i could say that hasn't already been said.  I was in love with Scott and Ryan from the moment I started reading and just loved them even more as the book progessed.    their story is so real and so vividly told.  Mark Kendrick did a wonderful job unfolding a story that is rich with heartwrenching emotion.  I felt for Scott and Ryan and I couldn't put the book down, not even for a moment.  My only issue with it was that it seemed to have a lot of typos in it...but i blame that on bad editting.  It didn't detract from the story at all and I will definitely be reading the story again at some point.  The sequel was amzing too,k i ended up reading that one in less than a day.  Everything was so vivid, right down to the sex scenes which were tastefully done and necessary to drive the story.  It gave the story more depth in my opinion and Mark Kendrick is to be commended.  It's so easy to get drawn in and you will like learning about Scott, Ryan and their friends.  a must read...one of the best gay themed novel i have read in a long time 
 This is one of the most engaging biographies I have ever read. Whether or not you are a Parker fan, this is a fascininating look at her life. I didn't know too much about her life prior to reading Meade's book, other than the common info about her drinking and suicide attempts. Everytime Parker headed for disaster, I wanted to shout "what were you thinking" but then her life wouldn't have been so memorable. This book is also a very interesting look at society and the role of women in publishing in the 1920s-1940s. Reading this biography will give any reader a greater understanding of Parker's work 
 I originally bought this for a clunky 17" CRT monitor about 2 years ago, and boy did it free up massive amounts of space on my desk!  Then when I switched over to a 19" LCD, I kept it and found it was still very useful, had enough room for my LCD plus a pair of computer speakers on top, and my cordless keyboard underneath.  Too many monitor stands these days have vertical supports at the front as well as the rear, which makes it impossible to slide your keyboard underneath when not in use...GRRR!  And just as importantly, I love the sleek, clean and simple design.  Mine was a dark brushed-nickel or titanium color, not sure if it's the same as this one listed as "black."  Too much of industrial design these days seems to be geared for the teeny-bopper bling-bling set, this one is obviously for adults.  It's too bad that Walmart no longer carries it, I'd buy another from them right now if I could for my new office!  
 Wilson's was a remarkable presence in a town that that has never gotten over the loss of the high-pay meatpacking firm.  Ms. Register wrote a fine and noteworthy account of a company town in rural America.  My grandfather worked there for many years chasing cattle up a four-story ramp to the 'kill.'  My father worked in the freezers after WWII and my uncle spent many years as a meatcutter.  I worked there one summer as did many of my friends and it defined the baseline economics of the union town and it defined what drugery  and workplace injuries were all about before we even knew the term carpal tunnel.  Beyond working there I witnessed the impact of the strike in 1959.      As a nine-year old I used to walk down the railroad tracks to the plant entrance and watch the rocks being thrown, cars being vandalized and anger controlled only by the National Guard.  One of my friend's fathers crossed the picket line to work.  He like other 'scabs' were labelled and treated as such for decades to come.  Ms. Register digs deeper into Albert Lea's labor past and unbeknownst to me identified an aunt as a striker at the local Woolworth's.  The effort of the local union to interject itself into other businesses defined the patrons that businesses would have (another relative who refused to unionize his small retail business found himself boycotted) and the success or failure to follow.   I'm surprised this has not been picked up as a movie.  Worth the read 
 "The Women's Murder Club", introduced to legions of new fans in "1st To Die", is an intelligent, plausible, modern idea whose time has come. It's also appealingly warm and cute without being the least bit trite, silly or cloying. Lindsay Boxer, a police lieutenant in charge of San Francisco's homicide division, Cindy Thomas, lead crime reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, Jill Bernhardt, assistant DA and Claire Washburn, Chief Medical Examiner, are four sharp, rising professionals in the field of law enforcement who have broken the proverbial male glass ceiling and have discovered the synergy of brainstorming their way to a solution of their mutual problems.  In "2nd Chance", our ladies are confronted with the brutal attacks of a serial mass murderer called "Chimera" who seems to be targeting black police officers and their families. While the thriller part of the novel is certainly not pedestrian nor is it the compelling, unique creative stuff which will draw gasps of shock and awe from any reader. What Patterson HAS done very well indeed is to put the apprehension of a dangerous psychopath into the format of an exceptionally well-crafted realistic police procedural that includes both the formal internal workings of the San Francisco Police Department together with the external informal deliberations of the four chums aka "The Women's Murder Club". There's more than enough of the stuff we've all come to expect - shoot-em-ups, twists and turns, red herrings - to keep the pages turning at a goodly clip! And the final climactic takedown of a sniper holed up in the bell tower overlooking Stanford University campus in Palo Alto is a real heart stopper!  What lifts this particular tale from the realm of ordinary thriller to the level of a much more thought-provoking novel is the realistic way in which the personal lives of the four ladies intrude on their professional lives (or is that vice-versa?). Jill Bernhardt deals with pregnancy and the loss of her baby by miscarriage. While she struggles with maintaining the personal detachment necessary to write a newspaper article, Cindy finds herself falling rather heavily for the pastor of the church that was the site of the first murder. And Lindsay struggles with the emotional trauma of meeting her ex-cop father who ran out on their family over 20 years earlier.  Patterson has also presented us with some very interesting philosophical discussion on the extent to which policemen have to tread that tightrope line between the law and the criminal. The concept of the "blue wall of silence" forms a chilling part of the killer's ultimate motivation and certainly stopped me reading in my tracks. The unanswered question that the Chief of the SFPD asks in the final few paragraphs revolves around this same question and provides an exceptional ending to a fine addition to Patterson's continually growing body of work.    "2nd Chance" is an exciting, well-paced thriller that includes good plot, great characters, realism and just the right amount of hope that the third installment in the series will tell us more about the personal stories of these new heroines on the literary scene.  Paul Weis 
 This is an excellent book for new gardeners and for old gardeners new to the biointensive method. Tells how to build a garden the right way, from the bottom up. If growing one's own food is the best way to stop the insanity of agribusiness, then John Jeavons is a mild-mannered but  effective revolutionary leader. He enlightened hundreds of thousands of us  with his 1974 groundbreaker How to Grow More Vegetables (than you ever  thought possible on less land than you can imagine) 
 This first book in the series is a favorite of mine and chronicles the story of an Irish-American woman and Irish man who meet in NYC, marry, and decide to return to their roots in the west of Ireland. They are both writers by trade and she is an artist, so it becomes a beautifully written story about their new lives, their new neighbors and the humorous things that happen as they readjust their thinking and attitudes. Each of us has probably at some time or other entertained the idea of "getting away from it all"--Christine and Niall have and share the trials and joys that come with living your dream.  As an aside, I met Niall Williams at a book signing in Chicago, and he is as personable and approachable as he seems in print. Be prepared to read all the books in the series 
 Homeport's theme is focused on the character of Dr. Miranda Jones and takes place along the coastal waters of Maine.  Enter, Ryan Boldari, a very handsome, exciting and extremely creative thief.  The story encompasses the world of art history and the Renaissance period creating lots of action and adventure as the world renown bronze, "The Dark Lady," disappears disclaiming Miranda's credibility as a top-level scientist in her field. Interesting dialogue on famous artists such as Michelangelo and their works are just added touches of enjoyment as Nora takes us on an exciting murder/mystery ride with romance and intrigue all mixed into one book.  I was captivated from the very first page and couldn't relax until I got to the end of the book to see how it all played out.  This, in my mind, is the main ingredient to a very good read. Once again, thank you Nora 
 Yunus tells a great story about his bank and its battle against poverty.  Outstanding business model for someone interested in micro lending 
 Absolute Power is Tech N9ne's follow up to his critically acclaimed Anghellic. Absolute Power is the result of many years in the recording industy, and in song's like "The Industy Is Punks" he shows his distain with the inudstry and the way it operates. Out of the two albums, I would say I like Anghellic a bit more because of it's darker, more personal feel, but Absolute Power is no less a great album. D-12 makes a great guest appearance on "She Devil" and you get introduced to Strange Music's own Kutt Kalhoun, Skatterman and Big Krizz Kalico on "Constantly Dirty," which is a great, slow paced song. I'm sure you've all read on many reviews that Tech is the most overlooked and underrated mc out there, but the only way to find out is to have a listen for yourself. I promise, you won't be disapointed. 
 I was delighted to stumble onto this book in a store called LuvDragons in Metcalfe Ontario over my holidays this year. This book covers a large selection of topics that many have missed, and introduces the reader to concepts rarely dealt with in similar books - such as Folkish and Universalist Heathenry. The author's unique approach of providing a suggested meditation for the Gods & Goddesses she covers is another great idea, and very helpful as a starting point for begginners. I was also happy to see coverage of deities rarely mentioned in other books, such as Hlin, and Fulla for example.  All in all, I think this is the best single book on Northern Heathenry out there today. The only topic not covered were the Runes, but there are so many books on this topic, I think this work stands solidly without it.  I plan to give copies of this book to any friends and family who are curious about my faith.  Is this a candidate for Northern Heathenry 101? It should be.  Well done 
 This is an absolutely fantastic read for simple-minded people.  If you are a simpleton, parrot, sheep, or otherwise unable to think for yourself and would rather have someone else do it for you, then you need this book.  I give it five stars for its appeal to base, primitive, thoughtlessness.      
 My results were fabulous. With that said, I was suffering from a back injury. By doing the movement prep only, I was able to return to my previous athletic conditioning. However, I am not a pro athlete and never will be competitive in the sports that I do (bicycling and running) 
 The mall was a big place for valley girls. Here comes their nightmare. When their not watching Miami Vice or going to a Poison concert, these teen mall employees have decided to party in the mall after hours...in a bed store, nevertheless. As you can guess, some drink beer and 2/3 of them have sex with their significant other. Remember you newlyweds, just because you have marital sex doesn't make you immune to horror death. Follow the rules, don't have sex in the same room as your friends, and don't sneak in the mall after closing time. While our friends are sinning the night away, the new mall security, technically advanced robots, were hit by lightning and are now murdering machines! Some funny scenes of the shadow of the mall doors closing with the robot in front, clenching its hand. An excellent death scene of the first blonde tart to go. That scene alone is worth watching no matter who you are. Corny, unrealistic, but heartwarmingly cheesy and memorable. A must for all horror fans.  December 18, 200 
 During my 15 years of architectural education and some years of practice (both as architect and as 'explainer' of architecture) I have not yet encountered a book on architecture which has changed my view on architecture so dramatically.  Juhani Pallasmaa's book makes an excelent argument for retrieving in architecture that which seems to have been lost for a long time: the lived intelligence of the bodilly senses. In his book Pallasmaa gives an overview of the development of the occularcentrism which is dominating architecture (and pretty much every cultural aspect) in the Western world for centuries and goes on to show how this leads to an impoverment of the architectural experience (and with that the impoverment of our daily lifes).   The mix of theory, practice and convincing examples (ranging from architecture, art, cinema to literature and poetry together with the size (80 pages) makes the book easily readable, even for the less theoretical inclined reader. My advice: read it!  For those of you who are as impressed with this book as I am: there's another book by Pallasmaa with the title 'Encounters'(published by Rakennustieto Oy Rati, June 2005). This book features a collection of essay's which were written by the author over the last 20 years. This book is also about the phenomenology of architecture but, due to its size (app. 350 pages), gives a broader overview of the thinking and writing of Juhani Pallasmaa. It seems it is not available at Amazon but I hope they will put is on there list soon 
 The first things that come to mind when looking at a book on sideshow freaks wouldn't be dignity, but that is what comes off the pages of Marc Hartzman's documentary.  The stories are wonderous and show both the fascination for these people and the oddness of their lives and careers but what you leave with is respect. Not only is this a fun book, it is a social document that reaches into what it means to be an American, and in broader terms, what it means to be human. Quite lofty stuff, but done grandly 
 I have owned this book since about 1995 when I was given a copy at my first inpatient program, White Deer Run, out in Allenwood, Pa. I was a hardcore heroin and coke junkie from the mean streets of Washington Heights who was also only 19  when the threat of jail or homelessness forced me into recovery. Of course, being the hardcore addict/hardhead that I was, I ended up both places and had to learn the hard way. I read this book daily in rehab and THOUGHT I had got it, but like it says in the book and in the rooms you have to WANT it in order to recover. Nobody can do it for you, recovery and surrender is up to the addicted person. This book showed up a handful of other times between the years of 1996-2005. Those years were miserable because I was in the grip of active addiction. But more or less, this book sat on my shelf for 8 years gathering dust while I slowly committed suicide. In early January of 2006 I picked it up once again, blew the dust off, and cracked it open. It still had a "new smell" believe it or not. I opened it up and a few minutes into it I broke down into tears. This was MY story, everything explained in the NA basic text is the life I have lived and have been living. I am FAAAAAR from a recovery thumper BELIEVE ME but what I can say is this much, this is the Bible for recovering addicts as the Big Book is to AA. I belong to both fellowships but it was NA and this basic text that saved my life. Within it, IF and the key word being if one is willing, are the steps and traditions and hope to stay clean, one day at a time. I have 79 days clean, a freaking MIRACLE for a junkie like me, and I attribute it to the basic text of NA and the fellowships. I agree with one other reviewer, even if you never touched a drink in your life but shot heroin or smoked crack or whatever, it won't hurt to pick up the AA "Big Book" as well. And I'll go on to say that picking up the CA fellowships Bible "Hope, Faith and Courage" is a good move too. Don't worry about mixed messages as my sponsor would say, all of the above have positive, life affiriming messages. But it is really the NA Basic Text which opened my eyes, over 10 years I owned and even read this book, but never really READ it until I was ready. If you are willing to surrender your addiction to the will of God of your understanding instead of your own selfish will, this is the book that you should have by your side. Another thing is that this is NOT a religious text it is spiritual, don't forget that! God simply means GOOD ORDERLY DIRECTION or can mean a million other acronyms, it is the SPIRITUALITY that is so prominent. There are Muslims, Orthodox Jews, Christinas, Buddhists, Taoists, Satanists, Scientologists, Agnostics, Atheists, and others too many to mention within the rooms who have read this book and found a better way to live. The other book one reviewer mentioned concerning Rational Recovery is pretty silly and I tell you why. YOU CAN'T DO IT ALONE! I don't care if your Tom Cruise or a bum from skid row, in order to recover you NEED fellow recovering addicts and you NEED the NA basic text.! It is just that simple, I tried recovering on my own and that was anything but RATIONAL. Again, I'm far from brainwashed by the fellowships, I just want to stay clean one day at a time and never have to shoot cocaine it into my arm EVER AGAIN. NA Basic Text= a GREAT way to start onto your new drug free and spiritual life! It is funny by reading this review I sound like the perfect NA poster boy but I have to drag my [...] to meeting half the time! Cracking open the  basic text, however, is ALWAYS a pleasure as well as a learning experience. Even if you are not an "addict" this is a very REAL and relatable book because it touches on LIFE problems as well. Reason being is that most addicts were addicted LONG before they ever picked up that needle, that crack stem, or that bottle, or the pill or the joint. Life goes on but through reading the NA text and working it's steps, it can go own CLEAN AND RENEWED and reading one page of the basic text is better than 1 gram or 1 kilo or 1 million!! The NA Basic Text can teach you things about LIFE and it is written for addicts, by addicts. The 12 steps and traditions are based on the 12 and 12 of Alcoholics Anonymous, the Grandaddy of it all, but back then in 1952 when Jimmy K founded NA as we know it today, addicts 9 times out o 10 were not welcome in AA. This book is all about CHANGE and RECOVERY. There isn't a better book out there about how to live clean and serene. Forget about picking up "Rational Recovery." I guarantee the author of that book never stuck a needle into an oozing abscess  becausee he was desperate to hit a vein. Sounds disgusting yes but this book "keeps it real" where other so called recovery books just fake the funk. All that aside, recovery has to be     WANTED and then this book can help you along that journey, one ay at a time.                  
 Well, first of all the viewers of this movie should not take it seriously.  Its not that type of movie. Its more of a campy/spunky type action film.  Yeah, it is a lot like Indiana Jones, and isnt Van Dammes best, but still has many high points to it.....at least I think. If you want Van Dammes best acting DONT start here, go to In Hell, Wake of Death, Lionheart, or maybe Timecop for that.  For his action/martial arts skills this isnt a bad place to go.  It has quite a few good action scenes in it. Van Damme is always cool as hell and has some good lines.  The ending is also pretty good as well. With the ending you get Van Dammes best kick(jumps and glides) out of all his movies he has ever done,even at his older age. The movie as a whole isnt nowhere near as bad as a lot of people think. Its just another action film that fans and MAYBE action fans should love.  But like I said its NOT TO BE TAKEN REALLY SERIOUSLY 
 My 2-year-old daughter LOVES this book and asks for it all the time.  The story is so sweet and simple, but with wonderful vocabulary and rhyming words.  A must have 
 I like this book much better than Wild at Heart, though I tought students from it for about half a year. The basic thing I've taken away from the books is that it teaches us to be open about our futures and grab some nostalga along the way. Waking the Dead like Wild at Heart focus on what most conservatives will call OPEN THEOLOGY. This approach to God creates a sort of open question as to the future and whether we have a hand in it. John frequently sets up statements that lead conservatives to view them as redefining God, His intentions and what scripture says.  While conservatives can tear apart these writings based on John's innaccurate portrayal of scripture, none I have spoken with have not liked the book. One man said they got him off his duff, out dating again, and on with his life - all good.  Scripturally sound, no. Biblically accurate, no. Encouraging and exciting and forward thinking, yes. It's a great read but just not to be reconciled for accuracy 
 I have read a few books recently dealing with economics and capitalism, and I have found this to be one of the best. It is certainly not a book that is without bias. Nonetheless, it is a refreshing reprieve from the   Keyensian /quasi-socialist values that imbue our society. Cox elucidates  the fallacies that drive economists, politicians, and average citizens to  believe that the government need only to attempt to manipulate the market  with regulations, taxes, and other ordinances in order to secure social  justice and prosperity. He disects such nonsense by displaying that the  market does not create inequity, it merely reflects it. Whether he does  this by showing how government interference helped cause, lengthen, and  deepen the Great Depression or how sacred cows of the American left such as  minumum wage laws and anti-trust statutes, the book always speaks in terms  the average reader can understand (though if not in format that is  sometimes a bit too brief). He also touches on many foolish economic  concepts of the other schools. This is an excellent introduction into  Austrian/laissez-faire economics, and it provides many suggested titles for  further inquiry into free market capitalism. Definitely worth a read 
 Of the many meditation guides I've tried this CD is one of the best. I return to it again and again for the soothing and relaxing effect. It helps me to remember to slow down and enjoy the little things more and let go of my control-freak tendencies. Good tool for our stressed out and over stimulated world 
 Stewart Lee Allen's delightfully crisp prose makes a trip through the history of food a rare treat. In this compulsively readable book, he presents the religious and social origins of food taboos - many of which have been carried forward to modern societies all over the planet. I found his insights into the derivations of many popular words and phrases to be fascinating. However, his irreverent attitude may be seen as heretical by people of various religions, Christianity being the main focus of his humorous finger-pointing. If you are not thin-skinned about hearing less-than-angelic things about your religion's history, I think you will find this book fascinating.  
 This film goes way beyond documentary into the realm of art.  As Herzog once said about a mountain, and as someone said about Herzog's work, it is "difficult ... dangerous ... ecstatic."   It begins as a more or less conventional documentary about airships and one man's attempt to design a smaller and more maneuverable ship, but as it goes, it turns into a meditation on what this ship, the "White Diamond," means to the people who encounter it, from the engineer who seeks redemption for his colleague's death, to the village children who cannot "see" it, to the local man who wants to fly to Europe to find his family and cease being "a lost brother, a lost son."  The airship is counterpointed with dazzling photography of the million swifts that fly in and out of a "Secret Kingdom" behind a waterfall, a flight that even the White Diamond cannot make. Other themes weave in and out -- levity, danger, and human emotion. The music is stunning.    A superb movie 
 I have had my Air-O-Swiss for 2 winters now. I live in the North East and the Winters are very dry. We only tend to turn on the humidifier during the winter times and so far the humidifier is working as good as new. I have not had the problems of the white powder that some reviewers have mentioned and I change the demineralization cartridge every winter. Cleaning is a breeze and I think it helps by the fact that I use Purified water for refills. Not sure if this is recommended but I do not see any lime sclae build up as a result. As already mentione dby others, the humidity level indicator is not accurate and as a result, I went out and invested a small amount of money to get a seperate indicator. I found a hygrometer for $5 in Sears and I tend to go by that reading rather than the built in one. I think that the price is costly but fair. You get what you paid for. A quiet, nice looking humidifier that is easy to clean and maintain 
 My wife and I had a blast watching this with our daughters (three and 10 months). The animation is fun and funky, and Molly Shannon is a hoot! Highly recommended 
 My husband and I purchased this gate to reduce damage to our walls and have a sturdy top of stairs gate, as we have a steep staircase with several stairs.  The gate is very sturdy, and overall is easy to install.  The only tricky thing about the installation is knowing how to properly lift and open the gate after tightening the screws. The gate does close on its own without having to lift the gate and handle as the instructions mention, but after looking at the packaging at how the gate is supposed to look after it is installed, and how to lift the door, we had to tighten the screws further into the cups on the wall to achieve the proper closure.  Would recommend this gate to those with small children, as it is very sturdy, but if there are elderly persons in the household, they may need assistance in opening the gate 
 Fortunately for me, this was one of the first books that I bought when I began learning technical analysis. This is probably the best book I own which touches on virtually every aspect of the subject. It is clearly written, and you can certainly read it even if you know nothing. Beleive me, we have all been there. And technical analysis can seem overwhelming when you begin.  My copy of this book is worn, is thoroughly underlined, and I have marked the most important pages. I still refer to it. If you want to get your money's worth, believe me, you should buy this book 
 While reading A Painted House, I had to keep reminding myself that this was a Grisham book!!  It honestly was not like anything else of his that I've read, and I was happily surprised.  The story of a farming family and the workers they take on that summer to help with picking cotton, is one that sweeps you up almost immediately.  The characters are so rich in description and the dialogue so compelling that before you know it you're thrown into the middle of the story that centers around a young boy who is trying his best to interpret the world around him.  In the meantime he's growing up a bit too fast.  The conclusion tied the perfect bow on this present of a story.  I'd definitely recommend this book to someone, especially Grisham fans who may have a bit of trepidation in reading something not centered around law.  
 More than any other poet I know, Jeffrey McDaniel proves that the phrase "good slam poetry" is NOT an oxymoron. In performance, McDaniel is unforgettable, yet his poetry is every bit as fresh, exciting and powerful on the page as it is read aloud. Jeff knows how to tie both language and logic into hiliarious, surrealistic knots, and how to plant little linguistic bombs that explode in almost every sentence. Yet his work also has a deep underlying seriousness, a disgust with the absurdity and petty cruelty of daily existence, which keeps it from being merely clever. If you are interested in getting acquainted with the best of America's younger poets, and if you like Beat poetry with a rock'n'roll edge, Jeff McDaniel's work is an excellent place to start 
 Learning Javascript gives a very thorough walk-through of the Javascript language. It doesn't just teach you how to use the language features that are the most convenient or popular. Powerful and advanced concepts (such as recursion and closures) are also covered in order to expose you to the entire language so you won't be surprised when you see it used in the libraries you may end up using. The book is filled with numerous best practices born of experience and historical anecdotes that provide valuable perspective. I've often wondered what the difference was between the various object models offered by the browser and this book answers that question.  The book is not designed to be a reference manual as it is not filled with tables that contain the properties of every object or function you may run across. It does, however, provide you with more in-depth information than you would probably be able to get from a reference manual. For example, it details the three different ways you can construct a function and provides information on when and why you may want to use each.  Each chapter of the book covers one aspect of the language. There are numerous examples that illustrate the concept being discussed. I really enjoyed seeing the author's depth of insight as she explains the various topics. You can tell she has been doing web development for a long time from all of the historical information she provides. This historical information has very practical value as it explains many of the idiosyncrasies of the language. I've often heard that Javascript is a very powerful and under appreciated language. This book attempts to expose that power and make it usable by all users of the language. I think the author has done a good job at doing just that. 
 My wife gave this film to me as a present a few years ago. I am a bit biased about this film. I give it five stars because I really think this is a very good film, and more importantly, it's so darn different from so many other films I have seen. I really like the acting of Koji Yakusho, and I wish more of his films were accessible here in the west. In fact, I would like to see him in more films. I think he is an incredible and underated actor in Japan. The film is a very strange one. The film starts with Yosuke Sasano (Koji Yakusho) being let go of the firm he works, and wondering where he will find a job at his age.   One of his friends is named Taro, who is a homeless old man, and he likes to revel in tales of his past youth. In one of these stories, and before his death, he tells Yosuke about a treasure of gold that he hid in a house near the sea in Noto. The treasure is near a red bridge. Out of work, with no idea as to when he will work again, Yosuke decides to leave Tokyo in search of this hidden gold. However, he comes across someone who has a very strange problem. The house where the gold is supposedly hidden also is the very house where this strange beautiful woman lives. Her name is Saeko (Misa Shimizu).  I don't want to give away her problem, as this will ruin part of the story for you, and the film. However, I will say that her problem is of a sexual nature. But the way it is treated is very hilarious and I might add, done in a happy sort of way. The Saeko's grandmother also lives in the house with her, and she is waiting for the man who left her, and promised to come back. However, that man was Taro, the homeless man who has since died. This is a delightful comedy that I really enjoyed, and I recommend that you at least rent it, because it is a charming film. High recommendations. 
 I have been reading Robin Williams' books since "The Mac is Not a Typewriter" came out. This author gives great, clear information that will help with the look of anything that you produce in print. (Or on the web) If you aren't a designer, or aren't particularly artistic, like me, you will benefit from this book because she gives clear examples of how to catch the reader's eye, and gives examples of pitfalls to avoid. There are also some who are a little too artistic for their own good. This book will help them avoid over-embellishing to the extent that their message doesn't get accross. A good buy for anyone who has to communicate in print. It doesn't matter if it's ad copy, a report for the boss, or your book, web site or menu. 
 but the company i ordered it from sent me a library book, I hope it was not taken. 
 I had always heard that this short story by W.W.Jacobs was one of the great classic Victorian ghost stories.  I was recently reminded of it when Stephen King mentioned it in his new e-book, "Riding the Bullet".   So, alas! - I finally got my hands on it, and it is indeed worthy of it's  acclaim.  A visitor brings a magickal talisman - a monkey's paw - to his  hosts' home; the macabre dismembered simian apendage is charmed with the  ability to grant wishes.  But the visitor who leaves the object with his  hosts, also leaves their premises with a strong warning of the outcome of  the things wished for 
 It is a really great book about SPC methods. Clearly written, Dr. Wheeler's book explains the dos and don'ts of SPC techniques. I found Dr. Wheeler's style of writing simple, but always reaching SPC target.  If you are looking for a sound and understandable information about SPC, read it. It is worthwhile book 
 One of AC/DC best that any rock group has to offer. Other groups have either sweet guitar rifts, or good vocals this one has it all. Buy this album and become a real ROCKER! 
 A thoroughly researched and well written book. Explaining to all how the French "Kopeks" and British divvied up the Ottoman Empire and how their actions has and will affect this region for centuries to come. 
 I had such bad hypothyroidism that went undiagnosed for so long, I almost died.  I finally found a doctor who diagnosed me and is treating me with Armour.  He studied and trained with Dr. Barnes.  If it weren't for Dr. Barnes and his unconventional methods, I'd probably be dead today.  My hair turned gray overnight, I gain 110 pounds in three months and hadn't changed the way I had been eating all my life yet I gained all the weight so fast and at the time I was doing aerobics and suddenly I no longer could because of the fatigue and joint pain.  I starting falling asleep during the day.  My immune system went bad and I ended up with bronchitis and pneumonia several times.  My cholesterol and blood pressure skyrocketed and I ended up with heart disease.  I became clinically depressed and felt suicidal.  I had short term memory loss and couldn't remember to do my work, pay bills, couldn't remember where my car was parked, couldn't remember hardly anything any more.  I almost lost my job and my life.  I had one foot in the grave and I was only 30 years old!  Conventional doctors and methods failed me.  Read this book!  Get on Armour and do the body basal temperture taking.  Some people are hypothyroid, but the TSH test doesn't even show it, like what happened to me.  If you think you're hypothyroid, but your doctor and the TSH don't agree, read this book, go to the Armour web site and find a doctor in your area who will prescribe Armour and forget about the TSH, do the body basal instead.  Armour is natural and has all the hormones that your thyroid natural puts out.  The synthetic stuff only puts out T4, your body needs more than just T4.  Some people like me, their body doesn't convert T4 to T3 so the synthetic thyroid medicine doesn't work well.  I first tried the synthetic stuff and felt horrible.  I then tried Armour and within hours I felt like a new person!  Now my life has completely changed for the better and I have Dr. Barnes and my doctor to thank.  Read this book and save your life 
 This movie is a classic. I put off buying the dvd and stuck with my vhs copy till a special edition was released. I was very glad when I found out about this upcoming special edition dvd. I plan on getting this and That Thing You Do when they come out the same day. Tom Hanks is a genius 
 I just recently used this book as part of my study to gain continuing professional education credits for my CPA license. I found it to be an excellent source for anyone who is currently planning his or her family's financial future. It's easy to understand, direct, and written with common-sense language. I will be recommending this book to my clients 
 I really enjoyed reading this book and I highly recommend it to any one who wants to read a well written and sweet novel. The principal character is Molly Gibson who is the daughter of a small town doctor. The story is mainly about what happens with Molly and those she loves when her father remarries and his new wife and stepdaughter come to live with him and Molly. The story is simple, but at the same time enchanting. Mrs. Gaskell's excellent writing will keep you reading even though some parts of the story are full with details and past stories of the characters. But at the same time, it is these background stories and details which allow the reader to really understand who each character is in the story and how they feel. So I don't don't agree with those who sugget that the book needs editing.  The novel is full with very interesting characters and all are presented in a way you'll end up feeling close to them, and caring for them. Even Mrs. Gibson and Lady Cumnor, who are mean and selfish, will claim your sympathy at some point because the author has the ability to present her characters not as good or bad, but just as human. She has an incredible way of describing regular people. And only this characteristic makes the book very enjoyable.   The book is long and does not have an ending... nonetheless, it is so beautiful!!!... I really recommend this novel because you'll never get bored. Even more, you'll learn to enjoy each of the things and stories that are going on in Hollingford (the little town where Molly lives)!. And although this is not an "addictive" reading, there are some parts in the novel where you cannot stop reading and for a hundred pages you won't be able to put it down. I think this is a novel to enjoy, not to read in an afternoon.  The fact that this novel is unfinished could be a drawback for some people, but the story is almost complete and you can tell what will happen at the end. Besides, all novels end at one point, and no matter how much the author tells us about the story, we readers always want to know more. So, I think that you can easily imagine what will happen in the last chapter in the same way that you can imagine what will happen with Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy at the end of Pride Prejudice (even though Jane Austen never wrote about that).  I agree that there is some similarity between this author and Jane Austen because both authors have the same sweetness in their writing. However, Mrs. Gaskell provides more details about the setting and the characters of the novel. So, all and all I would recommend this novel to the Austen readers and to all of those who enjoy romantic and classic novels. 
 I am a neuroscientist PhD candidate and this book was what originally made me interested in neuroscience!  
 "Barton Fink" a quirky film with a bizarre storyline conjured up by the talented and creative Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, is buttressed by a multitude of outstanding acting performances.  The film abounding with symbolism is one that probably should be viewed more than once.  Barton Fink played with a proper measure of neurosis by John Turturro is a New York playwright who has tasted his initial success in a well regarded 1941 Broadway show.  He parlays these sterling reviews into a position as a screenwriter for a movie studio in Hollywood.  He makes his way to Los Angeles ensconsing himself in a decaying bastion of an art deco era hotel serviced by wacky bellboy Chet played by a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi.  The hotels long and desolate hallways are symbolic of Fink's solitude in the unknown environment of Hollywood.  He meets studio mogul Jack Lipnick played in stupendous fashion by character actor Michael Lerner who assisted by Jon Polito as his gofer Lou gives him an encouraging pep talk.  Returning to the hotel Turturro immediately experiences writers block trying to create a plot for a wrestling movie starring Wallace Beery.  It seems like every little noise creates a distraction for Turturro's train of thought.  He soon meets his hotel neighbor the schizophrenic but sympathetic insurance agent Charlie Meadows played wonderfully by the corpulent John Goodman.  They become friends and Goodman helps soothe the nervous Fink and allay his anxiety.  Fink is encouraged to seek advice from other writers around town by director Ben Geisler played by fast talking Tony Shalhoub.  He meets eminent writer W.P. Mayhew an alcoholic Southerner played nicely by John Mahoney who is ably assisted by his secretary and secret ghost writer Audrey played by Judy Davis.  Turturro is discouraged by Mahoney's demeanor but is attracted to Davis.  Desperate for help with a writing deadline rapidly approaching, Turturro coaxes Davis to come to his room.  They have a romantic interlude but Turturro awakens the next morning to find her inexplicably lying next to him in bed dead in a pool of blood.  The plot gets dicey from this point with Goodman helping Turturro to get rid of the body and hide the crime.  Goodman is forced to leave town for business reasons and soon L.A. detectives come knocking on Turturro's door.  He soon learns that Goodman may have depraved dark side.  All the excitement however serves as inspiration for Fink who commences to bang out his script.  The movie concludes in fantastic symbolic fashion with Fink caught between the Coen brothers conception of Hollywood hell and heaven 
 I own Kama Sutra- it's one of my favorites in my movie collection.  I too, thoroughly enjoyed this movie and agree with many of the ratings other consumers posted, however, if I was looking to purchase the movie, I don't think I it would be neccessary after all the specific detail given up in the review section.  The idea of a review is to rate the movie and state your opinion, not give an in depth, written, scene for scene tell all.  What's the point of buying it, when so many customers have simply given away the entire film in an attempt to review it?  Please people, practice some restraint, I share your enthusiasm, but really what's posted here is TMI.  Too much information, don't ruin it for those who haven't experienced the adventure of Mira Nair's Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love 
 My son was diagnosed with a severe articulation disorder with possible apraxia. I didn't really understand this or know what to do with this information, especially when my insurance company told me they wouldn't cover speech therapy. Thanks to this book, I was made aware of free alternatives provided by my county school system. It also has some fun ideas for parents to work with the child at home. I would recommend this book especially for those who want a plan 
 King did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one.  There were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing.  For the most part, not bad.  Would make a good movie 
 I love this series.  Watching the antics that Amelia and her brood get into is so entertaining.  There are a number of years between the action in the previous book and this one, but not a lot has changed.  Ramses appears to have spent quite a bit of time roaming around on his own, and he has matured quite a bit.  Amelia and Emerson are just the same, and they are as hilarious as usual.  If I have any complaint it is with the character of Nefret.  As much as I love all the other characters in this series (and they are all like old friends to me after reading all the books up to now), I just can't get myself to like Nefret.  Her character does not ring as true as all the others.  She is a spoiled little girl who tries to act like Amelia, and fails miserably at it.  Anyway, this book is full of the usual villains, forgeries, tomb robbers and assassins.  There is enough action to keep any reader happy.  I can hardly wait to read the next book in this wonderful series 
 After buying a pair I purchase more.  These are the greatest for comfort.  It is like going without, but better 
 If you live in Texas and want to garden organically....this is THE book for you.  I have been gardening (as organically as possible) for decades, and found tons of information in this very thorough tome.  LOVED IT 
 This earlier production of "Bleak House" is more true to the spirit of Dickens' novel  than the remake, and the mood and ambiance are far more poetic. No production, no matter how ambitious, can capture every detail and character of Dickens' rich and prodigious novel, but this production should not disappoint even the most dedicated reader. There is no insertion here of contemporary attitudes, which often mars the remake. Diana Rigg and Denholm Elliot were superb, and for this viewer, Suzanne Burden was the perfect Esther. But if you think you like Dickens--read the book. It's incomparable. 
 This is Carey at his best. This movie is hilarious and the special features are awesome 
 This was one of the first The Firm workouts I bought.  I was disappointed with the warm up, I don't think even now that she does enough on this, especially with the amount of climbing and squatting that is done. I just learned to do alittel additional stretching beforte I started.   That said, the rest of the workout is pretty good. She transitions well from one move to another (some of the other video's it seems you aren't quite where you need to be for the next sequence, or you just aren't where you need to be) giving it a pretty good flow. She alternates upper and lower body with aerobics making it fun to do.   If the warm up isn't great the cool down and stretch is one of the best and I incorporate some of the stretches into other video's. I still use this workout even though I have others that are newer. My biggest complaint about the Firm is that for every new video I buy I have to get a new piece of equipment, I wish they would incorporate some of their old equipment into new workouts.  
 "The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea" is truly one of the classic works of late 20th Century world fiction, written during the final years of Mishima's life. As a harrowing tale of wayward youth and the sailor who does indeed fall from grace with the sea, this slender novel is such a riveting exploration of human relations and emotions that the reader does not need to know anything about the author. But knowing that Yukio Mishima was a staunch idealistic militarist who sought Japan's renewal and spiritual redemption from its "glorious" early 20th Century imperialist past, committing seppuku (ritual suicide) as a public protest of Japan's pacifist leanings certainly is quite useful in informing the reader about Mishima's intentions and perhaps his raison d'etre for writing this novel.  In "The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea", Mishima sets up a riveting, unexpected climax between the sailor and a young boy who idealizes him at first for his masculinity, before discovering the sailor's "weak", almost feminine, side to his personality. The young boy is a member of a band of vagabond boys who share too his enthusiasm for the sailor at first, and who help set in motion a fascinating series of events which will have dire consequences for all. Mishima excels in exploring both the Western and Japanese notions of male-female bonding, especially in his description of the boy's relationship to his mother, and to her suitor, the sailor. Rarely have I've come across a novel as intriguing as Mishima's slender tome; its gripping tale will linger in my memory for a long, long time 
 It doesn't matter if you have heard of Alice Munro or not.  This collection of short stories by one of the best short writers in the world bespeaks of sensitivity and a high mastery of the craft of writing.  The stories are about women and love in all of its forms.  Deceit, trust, love, desire and regret.  The protagonists in each story are well thought out individuals, not a false note in any of them.  Alice Munro succeeds in telling a story without slipping into a basket of clichs, rather telling stories as they really do happen in real life without a twinge of regret for having done so.  Her characters are introspective while very much being a part of the world they inhabit.  They are strong, weak, they have faults, in essence, they are believable which is the highest compliment a writer can receive.  Anyone wishing to learn the craft of writing short stories would do well to start here.  
 This book was wonderful. I passed it on to friends who normally don't enjoy reading. They loved it. They couldn't wait to tell me what part they were reading about and how excited they were. That's what they get for not reading. Also make time to read Master of the Game. Another 5 star book 
 From the inventor of step aerobics.  You know that Gin knows what she's doing and how to do it.  She invented Step Reebok so she does know a thing or two.  I love this workout.  It's all the step classics here.  She doesn't use fancy dance steps, but the intense moves you do in this are designed to maximize results.  She makes this fun with tempo variations and directional changes.  It's really well designed and her cueing is clear and precise as always.  There are straddles and repeaters etc etc.  All the good moves to make you sweat and fit.  Enjoy.  You'll feel this for a day or two afterward 
  "Fatal Justice" concerns the so -called Green Beret Murders, which occurred at Fort Bragg, NC in February, 1970.  A young Green Beret Captain, Jeffrey MacDonald was eventually convicted of killing his wife and two infant daughters. There were several doubts about the Government's case: Among them was mishandled evidence the night of the murder, a hostile trial judge, the accused's selection of a presumptively inappropriate defense attorney and the refusal of the court to entertain exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, there had been an extraordinary delay in brining MacDonald to trial. The Fort Bragg Provost Marshall had refused to recommend a court-martial. Since the proceeding rendering that decision was labeled a "criminal investigation" and not a "judicial proceeding", CaptainMacDonald was eligible to be charged in a civil court free of double jeopardy. His appeal based on lack of a speedy trial was denied. MacDonald received three life terms in Federal Prison and there he sits to this day. In the early 1980s, the popular novel "Fatal Vision" told the MacDonald story to the country. It raised considerable doubt about the quality of the conviction. Yet this reviewer believed, as did many Americans, that justice had likely, if not definitively, been achieved. A TV movie with Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint solidified that sentiment.  Fatal Justice turns the entire MacDonald affair upside down: FJ is the most disturbing true crime report this reviewer has read. It was hard for this reviewer to remain calm! FJ denotes in great and painful detail how MacDonald was railroaded to the jailhouse by a lying, duplicitous, dishonest prosecution that first decided on his guilt and then made the evidence fit their case. There was wholesale direct or indirect suppression of evidence. Other witnesses who could have cleared the Captain were not allowed to testify-including one man who admitted to the murders! Disclosures from the ubiquitous Helena Stoeckley would have blown the case open! The Captain's original claim that drug crazed intruders committed the act, which seemed so far fetched at trial, now appears exculpatory. A strong defense could have raised so much reasonable doubt with a fair- minded jury!  Yet after years of research by the authors, not to mention teams of MacDonald lawyers, the courts have ruled that it is too late to introduce new evidence! MacDonald's attorneys should have exercised due diligence and discovered the surpressed evidence back in the 1970s! How does one discover evidence that, for all practical purposes is surpressed?  It is safe to assume that those interested in the case have read FV. These folks owe it to themselves to also read FJ! Everyone is entitles to their own opinion but this reviewer questions how anybody who contemplates FV and FJ can fail to agree that MacDonald is innocent. The expectation of a fair trail, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, the concept of reasonable doubt in determining innocence, the guarantee of speedy trial, the convicted's due of a just and impartial appeal, redress against prosecutorial misconduct, the right to have exculpatory factors admitted as evidence are all outrightly assaulted by the MacDonald murder case. Any of the amazon community can suffer from an over-zealous prosecution someday. FJ is deeply serious food for thought, regardless of one's opinion on the specifics of the Green Beret Murder Case. Critics may carp that FJ is sometimes repetitive.  The view here is that the authors are good lawyers  driving home their points. Messrs. Potter and Bost should be commended for their dogged research and pursuit of the truth. 
 I have used this book in my practice as an OB-GYn Nurse Practitioner and have recommended it to many of my patients and friends with daughters about to enter puberty.  It isn't the dry, clinical text seen in earlier works  and the illustrations make it fun.  I believe the best chapter to be  "What if...?" as it was written in collaboration with the  author's 15 yo niece 
 I had the privilege of seeing Mr. Stewart perform this live in New York City several years ago.  It was an amazing experience - I walked out of there absolutely convinced that there were at least 40 people on stage with him even though he was alone.  This recorded version is wonderful because you have the magic of his voice which is all you really need.  Put this on, have some egg nog and decorate the tree 
 I read Highlight Magazine faithfully when I was a child.  Now I am a mother of two (2nd grade and Kind.).  I just got a tip from a teacher at school - the writers of the Highlight (Harcourt) also write the exam for the 3rd grade state test in New York state.  
 This book will most certainly teach you the essentials of creating a quiet garden space for thought and reflection. The range of ideas is extraordinary and the photos will inspire you. However, the text is at times rather "sappy", i.e., a bit too sentimental and too tritely philosophical. I found myself racing through the prose to get to the design elements but was very satisfied with the useful content, once found 
 May your feet always be swift,  May you have a strong foundation When the winds of changes shift. May your heart always be joyful, May your song always be sung, May you stay forever young, Forever young, forever young, May you stay forever young.  Bob Dylan's song, Forever Young, serves as one of Dave Kindred's melodic themes in his wonderful book, "Sound and Fury". Sound and Fury is a biography of Muhammad Ali, Howard Cosell, and the relationship between them.   Sound and Fury carries the reader along as Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay, and Howard Cosell, born Howard William Cohen, burst like stars upon the public's imagination in the 1960s and takes them through their respective heydays and then to their inevitable fading away.  Kindred, a sportswriter for close to forty years, began his newspaper career at The Louisville Courier in Muhammad Ali's hometown.  He covered Ali since his earliest days, his glory days. It also seems he was one of the few print reporters that Howard Cosell respected and liked. They stayed in close touch with each other until Cosell's death.  But, although it is quite clear that Kindred admires and respects both men, and with feelings toward Ali that are powerfully affectionate, even loving, Sound and Fury is no hagiography.    The book takes us quickly through Ali and Cosell's early days.  As Kindred alternates between Ali and Cosell's struggle for success in their respective fields one can see the similarities between the two, particularly a single-minded determination to achieve their goals.  Ali and Cosell came together in the public imagination after Ali's conversion to the Nation of Islam and his decision to refuse induction into the Army after being (finally) classified as draft-eligible. Ali's famous line "I ain't got nothing against them Viet Cong" made him something of a marked man. Ali was stripped of his title, denied the right to box, and convicted of draft evasion, a conviction later overturned by the Supreme Court.  Cosell was one of the few to stand up Ali and it was this stand that helped make Cosell as controversial as Ali. Kindred does an excellent job covering the evolution of the symbiotic relationship between the two men. Kindred points out that Cosell was always very careful never to endorse Ali's views about religion or the war in Vietnam. Rather, Cosell always made it very clear that he argued only that Ali had a fundamental right to hold those opinions and no one had the right to deprive him of a livelihood simply because he held unpopular views.  Kindred, for all his respect and admiration for both men, is quick to point out those instances in which Ali and Cosell acted badly.  Ali's treatment of his original religious mentor, Malcolm X, after Malcolm was tossed from the Nation of Islam and then killed is covered as is his brutal and unfair characterization of Joe Frazier (calling him less than a man and an Uncle Tom when in fact Frazier had grown up in greater poverty and experienced more racism than Ali had).  Kindred does not hesitate to take Cosell to task for his vaunted insecurity and his callous treatment of those around him, particularly print journalists whom he considered to be inferior beings.  Kindred's coverage of Cosell's stormy tenure on Monday Night Football is both informative and balanced.  Kindred is at his finest in describing the twilight of each man's career, Ali's descent into a Parkinson's syndrome induced shell of his former self and Cosell's withdrawal into retirement, seclusion after the death of his beloved wife Emmy, and eventual death.  Kindred comes close to capturing that which cannot truly be captured: the ineffable feeling of loss that someone experiences when time has passed them by.  This feeling must be particularly intense in the case of those who once were the center of worldwide (Ali) and national (Cosell) attention.  That indescribable notion is set out in the second melodic theme that marks "Sound and Fury". Cosell's favorite poem, one he recited at length with or without prompting, was Keats' Ode to a Nightingale and one which Kindred cites often in his book.  If Dylan's Forever Young serves as a theme for Ali and Cosell's early days, Keats' Ode serves as a mournful and extraordinarily apt coda.   Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget  What thou among the leaves hast never known, The weariness, the fever, and the fret Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;  Dave Kindred has written a wonderful account of Ali and Cosell and their lives spent at the intersection of sports and the media.  It will satisfy sports fans and non sports fans alike.  It was a great read. 
 Nasty, incisive polemic on the insidiousness of the State, whose nature changed over the years. The State is essentially an anti-social entity which provides the political means for a faction or factions to enrich  themselves at the expense of others. All sorts of eye-opening arguments  here, including a reexamination of American history.  Astute criticisms  that you don't always understand fully until you read them again and begin  to "absorb" them 
 You can read the reviews to find out how moving and real this film is.  Jane Fonda, Jon Voight and Bruce Dern are all perfect in their roles. Since the soundtrack doesn't seem to be available, I am going to share with you the songs played on the soundtrack so that you can compile your own soundtrack.  They are organized by group.  Happy Viewing and Listening!  This is a film not to be missed.

 This book is a history of the number concept (with emphasis on the concept of infinity) from ancient days to nearly the present. If I have one complaint about it, it is that the book is very thin and could have said more on a few topics that I think are important; for example, the treatment of Robinson's "non-standard analysis" is very brief and would benefit by expansion. Still, it is an interesting read, and belongs in the library of anyone interested in the subject matter.   Since much of the calculus depends on the concept of the infinite (and the infinitesimal) this book is particularly recommended for those interested in the origins of the calculus 
 Anyone who wants to understand computers should read this book. It describes the intellectual pre-histroy of the computer, and blends biographic vignettes in with the technical information. You'll learn alot, and enjoy it too 
 As a writer, and as someone who reads 100 books a year, I can usually spot where writers are going before they even get there. I've read several of Kellerman's books, but this one is not predictable and never gets old, and is so skillfully written that no matter how many times I read Over The Edge, I can't figure out how he ties everything up in such a neat package and ends the story with such a meaningful last sentence, which makes me cry every time I turn the last page.   As for the plot: How could the imprisoned and nearly comatose (when we first meet him face to face, and for most of the novel) Jamey Cadmus have strangled and mutilated a handful of prostitutes? But all the evidence points toward him. When we eventually find out why he is the only suspect, we have uncovered some of the rottenest, meanest forms of inhumanity towards the most vulnerable in our society.   Kellerman has filled Over The Edge with larger than life, colorful characters, even the secondary ones: Tully Antrim is kinda hip and cool; the art store owner has a major attitude; even the players in the Mexican restaurant seemed to have full lives beyond their short scene. I imagine Kellerman had a lot of fun with the two cops and all their scenes; I crack up every time they show up. As for the major characters, Alex Delaware is always a delightful pleasure to meet and get to know; Milo is a sweetie; Robin is a pleasant mystery; and Jamey, every time we meet him, is an uncomfortable reminder of whether or not he is guilty of extreme violence.  Kellerman tapped into some of my deepest fears: I was considered highly gifted at an early age, was aware of the term "genius/madness" shortly thereafter, and subsequently terrified that something horrible would go wrong with my brain, as happens to Jamey. The ride Kellerman takes me on every time I read this is frightening, thrilling, interesting and ultimately satisfying. I will never forget Jamey's story 
 I purchased this book about a year ago (different cover photo from that illustrated at the moment) and within a few hours I was able to do some card tricks that impressed my wife and kids. In a book this size you are going to find everything from some self-working tricks and kid oriented tricks to very convincing sleight of hand with coins and cards. There is even a section on more elaborate magic with big props and disappearing people.   My mother-in-law, who grew up in NY City in the depresssion and saw a lot of people hoodwinked on the street w/ shell and card games, was not convinced that what I was doing was impressive. But when I asked her to explain how the tricks worked she could not. A true test I say!  This is a great book for any child just starting out to an adult who has always wanted to learn a few card and coin tricks. In my opinion this is a better introduction to magic than any of those box sets that are so ubiquitous in the toy stores. Some final thoughts, be sure to practice because as soon as folks know you are learning magic from a book they will dismiss your "magic" as simple tricks and look *very* closely at your moves adding additional pressure. And make sure you have a good excuse for not giving away the secrets... everyone wants to know how it was done 
 Marcia Wieder's latest book is upbeat,user friendly and wraps it's arms around you as you read it.I know Marcia and have seen her in action many times. It is wonderful to see her creative and heartfelt energy that has  helped thousands achieve their dreams, captured so brilliantly in this  book. I believed I could create my dreams more and more as I read each  page. I was especially impressed with the ease and flow I found as I went  through the exercises. The stories of how other people created their dreams  by using the many tools this book offers, was very inspiring and so  believable that I was moved to say to anyone that has a dream,large or  small,this book is a must 
 What a read!  Like Miss Koen's other historical novels, I couldn't put Dark Angels down 'til I reached page 530. I was so totally immersed in the court life of Charles II and the story of Alice,his Portuguese Queen Catherine's lady-in-waiting, I barely came up for air. Trying to speed read was impossible because every paragraph was filled with details and action that was not to be missed. Court life was so different from our lives today, the book makes for fascinating reading and not a little history in the passing, fictional or non. But I might say that at the last, it's as though the author got tired of writing her novel and decided to zip it up. The story came to a sudden and predictable ending, leaving many questions of "what happened to". Could this have been Koen's way of setting up for a sequel? Let's hope so 
 This 213 page book is just full of an endless supply of full color photos of everything Disney for the past 100 years. You'll learn all about Walt's early life and how his ideas created worldwide Disney worlds.  Each chapter covers a decade from 1901 to 2001 !!  Many of these pictures are archival and never made available before. The book provides many memories for "children" of all ages. It's a keeper. Enjoy  
 Superbly directed by Menndez for PBS's American Playhouse, "Stand and Deliver" is a cut above most motivational storytelling, because it bypasses sentimentality in favor of a more complex, authentic tone. Olmos is a marvel as Escalante, a brilliant but idiosyncratic educator, and he deservedly nabbed an Oscar nomination. Among a dynamic supporting cast, Lou Diamond Phillips also impresses as the troubled youth who faces a choice between gang life and academic glory. 
 That's what J-14 stands for. It's for teens pretty much yes. If you like gossip, posters, and info on your favorite celebs, music,and movies. I just started collecting them last September and I think their good. I don't care abou the gossip that much but I like the rest of it. I'm sick of seeing those kids off of High School Musical though. I wish they would take them out of the magazine. Especially Zac Efron...blech. Their good magazines though 
 This book is a mixture of mathematical history and basic statistics and probability with examples of their use. Bennett writes lucidly and succinctly. I would have liked to see some topics, such as paradoxes of probability (e.g. the Simpson's paradox) explained in greater detail. Sometimes the book tackles a topic very briefly and then drops it rather abruptly. As a result, it may be difficult to grasp the importance of a topic and to see the connection between topics. All in all, however, the book is a very good reference manual for a beginner. This is essentially a handy long encyclopedia article on a fascinating and important subject 
 Wynton was still in his twenties when he made this album, but he certainly got it right.  Terrific solos (by him and other members of the band), fantastic composition, and wonderful production make this an important recording to own.  My favorite tune?  Melancholia.  The shortest tune, yet the one that touches my soul the most 
 I've read this novel four times now, and it grows in strength each time.  I only award it four stars because there is, presumably, a five-star novel out there existing in the minds of the Olympians.  The only more perfect novel I can think of is Gustave Flabuert's "Madame Bovary."  Let me say this about my first reading of "Crime & Punishment."  It was my senior year of high school.  My teacher, Harriet Balle of University City High School in San Diego, was largely a waste of time in terms of her ability to teach us anything useful about the book.  Fortunately, she had the good taste to recognize Dostoevsky as a author worthy of teaching to 12th-graders.    Upon starting the book at the time -- keep in mind I had read most of Shakespeare's plays, Graham Greene's "Power and the Glory," as well as Solzhenitsyn's "The First Circle" -- I thought it an immense waste of time.  In fact, I can honestly say that I read through the bulk of its 400 plus pages without batting much of an eye until the very end, when Raskolnikov, such a [..]through most of it, suddenly begs the forgiveness of Sonya, the prostitute.    That's when I wanted to get down on the floor myself.  It was quite unlike any other sensation I've ever experienced before or since, and no other art form has ever produced it in me.  It was a "riding to Damascus" experience, and I, like St. Paul, had suddenly been knocked off my horse.  Other Dostoevsky novels have almost, but not quite, replicated the sensation of shock that this one produced in me.  
 Excellent reading for anyone trying to start or get a business going 
 	A Long Day's Journey Into Night by Eugene O'Neill is a short, autobiographical play that acts as a single snapshot into O'Neill's childhood. Focusing on issues rarely addressed in its day, A Long Day's Journey depicts the struggles within a family over alcoholism, drug addictions and the sickness and death of children. These subjects were frequently brought up in O'Neill's childhood, as his father and older brother were both alcoholics and his mother was addicted to drugs. O'Neill, himself, suffered from tuberculosis as did the character Edmund, who closely represents O'Neill in the play. An interesting detail to note would be that within the play, Edmund's mother and father talk about a son, named Eugene, who died years previously. It seems as though O'Neill tried to write himself out of a play he wrote about his childhood. 	 A Long Day's Journey has four main characters: James, the father, Mary, the mother, Jamie, the older brother, and Edmund, the younger brother. The play begins and ends with all four characters conversing together, but the middle of the play focuses on conversations held between only two or three of the family members. This allows the present characters to speak freely about the absent ones and gives the audience a disturbingly real view of how characters feel about each other. This also makes the play, though autobiographical, unbiased in the information it gives its viewers. If the play were written from Edmund's point of view, we would not hear the other characters talking about him. This unbiased view is important in maintaining the realism of the play; every character gets to voice their fears, doubts, and opinions when others are not present, ensuring that the audience gets the raw truth. 	 O'Neill's play is full of the raw truth. His father really was a famous actor and his mother was addicted to drugs. His childhood was spent, as mentioned in the play, traveling from hotel to hotel as his father toured the country. The complaints and arguments within the play were probably exhausted in O'Neill's childhood and he probably had many opinions of his own; but he still managed to leave himself out of his work, allowing his character to be represented without his person beliefs overruling those of his family. By giving each character opportunity to speak without judging what they have to say, and by writing himself in without making himself the star, makes this autobiography truly unique. A Long Day's Journey Into Night is a simple yet elegant snapshot of family life 
 Short, literate stories, each with a moral, allowing a child to get the idea of drawing a generalization from a story. The brevity makes them understandable as wholes and a manageable size for older children to read (my four-year-old child finds them interesting enough to motivate her reading and short enough to permit success). My favorite editions of these tales place one fable and illustration per page.  More at strongbrains.com 
 This honestly written books gave me goosebumps.  The first two chapters are the most riveting 
 The law is there for a reason, and there's no good reason that Jane escaped it. 30 years is nothing, and whether she's sorry or not is meaningless in the shadow of facts. Letting go because of time elapsed is not justice and not a sufficient argument for disdain of this well written book 
 I will never forget the first time I picked up this book. I was wandering through the shelves of my local bookstore and, seeing the title (which was uncannily similar to the title of a heinously bad '80s movie), I decided to glance through it.   The last thing I expected was one of the funniest, cleverest, most absorbing books I'd read in ages. I have to say that this and Connie Willis' To Say Nothing of the Dog vie for supremacy in my mind for the funniest work of speculative fiction. The second story, especially, made me laugh so hard I had to put the book down and take deep breaths. The characters are marvelous, and the situations they find themselves in are deliciously outlandish.  Go out and buy this book! I promise you won't be disappointed, as long as you leave your expectations for the genre at the door. Escape from Kathmandu is nothing if not unconventional. 
 When I bought this, I got the "oh great...more stuff that won't ever get used & will clutter up my house" look from my husband, which I reminded him of tonight.  I did buy it prematurely- our almost 3 year old wasn't remotely interested in using any potty, so it did sit around for a while.  But ever since she started using the potty (first hers, now ours w/ her seat), we have taken it with us everywhere.  Not just for the sanitary reasons, but every bit as much for the size.  We also use it with the pottys at her grandparents' houses or my husband's office potty which we're the only ones that use.  The couple of times (tonight included) that we've forgotten it & she had to go in public, it is a nightmare.  First there's the layers of seat covers, then and even worse is trying to position her little behind on that enormous seat with the big ol' opening in the front which means her legs have to be out at an angle so she doesn't end up right there.  Then she says it hurts from all her weight being in the two places where the seat goes across her.  Yes, I pinched myself in the beginning when we were in a hurry & I didn't have it down yet how it folded, but it was well worth it in my eyes.  Bottom line- I love it, I highly recommend it, I would be totally lost without it.  So worth three times (and more) what I paid for it 
 I saw the series back in the 80's, and enjoyed them then. My wife, daughter and parents-in-law did not, but on viewing it now they became instantaneously "addicted" to it; that much we had to view one episode every day during our X-mas vacation. My father in law (85 years old) particularly likes the historic accuracy. We alle like it because of the integration of drama on a personal and family scale with events worldwide. All the attention for detail (eg in requisites) makes watching extra worthwile. 
 Some writers are trashing this 10th offering and accusing the author of having someone else write for her.  So What!  I laughed and smiled a lot as this book kept me company on my long daily commute.  Have fun, buy it.. enjoy 
 I purchased this book after missing the second cut in a tournament that I roll in every year.  John Jowdy's reputation speaks for itself. After reading the first four chapters on the free armswing, leverage point, hand grips and follow through, I bowled my first ever 700 series in league play (I currently have a yearbook average of 175)and I broke my personal best score twice in the same week (269 followed by 278 two nights later). Anyone, and I mean ANYONE who is serious about improving their game must buy this boo 
 I'm no audiophile, but I definitely am a music lover and listen to a wide and diverse selection.  For the price and size of these baby's, I am thoroughly satisfied, maybe even a little surprised at the clarity of sound and range from deep bass to high treble.  So as far as I am concerned, these definitely exceeded my expectations.  They're solid 
 I enjoyed every chapter and I especially appreciated the author's hand drawn illustrations. I also learned a lot about how forests develop and the importance of biological diversity. I think that I will now see a lot more when I walk in forest. Like the other reviewer, I feel inspired to acquire some acres of logged out land up North and let the forest grow 
 Not like most biographys. Not indepth enough. Does not really explain how the deals really happened. Would like for someone else to give a go at another one 
   Hill's book is extremely insightful.  It's very descriptive and chocked full of authentic Italian recipes and stories from Hill's gangster life.  The recipes range from very simple to somewhat complicated, depending on the reader's preference.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about the real-life, but old style of Italian cuisine 
 Whether you are a beginner photograher or you having been taking photographs for years...there is a lot in this book that im sure you never thought of when you snapped your picture.  It has a lot of great information in it 
 This movie's villian, Cylack, was brilliant. Also, who can forget the moving scene where Neely elicits the location of the medalions from the dying con? This scene was brilliantly acted, full of emotion and pathos. In  short, the villians Cylack and Neely made this movie superb 
 Dr. Richards' otherwise excellent book about the Mughal Empire is marred by his failure to pay very much attention to its women.  Gulbadan is mentioned but once, Jodh Bai, Shah Jahan's mother, not at all, Nur Jahan  and Mumtaz Mahal only peripherally.  Are the Mughal chronicles themselves  similarly silent about these women?  Since Gulbadan wrote her own, one must  say no 
 Monica Grady is a world renowned expert and is probably best known for her edited volumes,  Catalogue of Meteorites, which have generated rave reviews.  Dr. Grady's text, Astrobiology, is a wonderful little book, which provides an excellent overview of the field and which contains numerous photos.  It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and is this book is well worth reading and would be of interest to anyone desiring a brief but thorough introductory overview of the field of astrobiology. -Rhawn Joseph, Ph.D. author of: Astrobiology, the Origin of Life, and the Death of Darwinis 
 In Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking Of The Global Food Supply, renowned environmental activist Vandana Shiva charts the impacts of globalized, corporate agriculture on small farmers, the environment, and the quality of  the food we eat. Shiva writes about genetically engineered seeds, patents  on life, mad cows (and sacred cows), shrimp farming, and more. Stolen  Harvest is a passionate, articulate, highly recommended "wake up"  call to the public regarding the role of genetic engineering in commercial  agriculture, the growing domination of agribusiness with respect to world  food supplies, and the need for sound environmental thinking with respect  to feeding the burgeoning populations of the world 
 As an American boy growing up in France, we had only to hop it down to the local grocery to find the very best terrine.  Massimo Montanari, author of a new compendium of his food columns, has written an exciting book about how and why people (especially in the Wrst) became interested in eating as an aesthetic proposition.  Just yesterday here in San Francisco, I had the strange experience of having one of Montanari's columns come to life, as at a festive Thanksgiving dinner, someone brought a heaping box of cranberry flavored biscotti, explaining that the Italian bakeries of North Beach made them only at Thanksgiving and Christmas, for there's no market for them at other times of the year.  Exactly, Massimo Montanari would exclaim.  One of his chapters shows how once a dish is associated with Christmas, you never see it the whole year round, and some foods (gingerbread for example) have been unfairly stigmatized with this "Christmas branding," although anybody could enjoy a nice piece of gingerbread in any season except that culturally, it would revolt us and most of us, even if we were starving, shipwrecked with Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Sun and the rest of the cast of LOST, on a desert island, most of us would turn up our noses at gingerbread.  Brillat Savarin said it best, "Tell me what you eat anbd I'll tell you what you are," but canny old Massimo Montanari turns the good Frenchman upside his head to produce a slew of new apercus.  He knows his history backwards and forewards.  When, for example, did Europeans introduce the custom of providing salad, sherbet, or just plain still water between courses?  Montanari knows!  And, he theorizes: would you ever suspect that the popularity of McDonalds is at least partially due to its providing the atavistic thrill of eating with one's hands, a practice that has been gradually taken from us since its heyday in the Middle Ages?  Even if you think you're not interested in food, this book will make you wonder how much of it is you, and how much of you is it 
 At last I was able to find a book about espionage that could keep me awake after 30 minutes of reading late in the night. The topics include a wide range of operations, some well known and some others not (like the Israelis' succesful attempt to purchase 200 tons of uranium from Belgium through a German firm in 1968 in order to build their nuclear arsenal), the writing style is simple but excellent and Volkman knows well how to keep the reader fixed. Surely, some subjects deserved to be better analyzed in greater details, but the book is only an introduction to the espionage operations and it must be considered as such. It certainly fired my interest 
 I recommend this book to rock music aficionados who hunger for deeper analysis and more thoughtful work than is the typical fare for books about this genre. It helps to have some interest or fond memories for glam rock, but the chapters about performers one may not know that well or never cared for (e.g., Suzie Quatro, for me) are as compelling as those about ones personal faves. While some of the discussion may be a tad academic for the casual reader, I urge the casual reader to read on, because he will learn something and be entertained. The author is well aware that writing a book is a performance of sorts, and does not ignore his obligation to keep the reader entertained even as some sophisticated and/or obscure concepts are dealt with.  Full disclosure: the author is a college friend of mine and I am thanked in the credits for having read over a few chapters in draft.                   - Peter Shapiro 
 I loved the way the author approached the alphabet by first telling what the article was in its beginning, i.e. A is for seed, tomorrow's Apple 
 This book is very important.  It is not only important so that we can understand the negativity of prejudice, but important because it helps us understand the importance of love towards a child and the significance of  nurture in adulthood.  This story is not only a true story, but it somehow  shows the importance of understanding the psychology of individuals.  The  Elephant Man proves that once a child is reared with love and care, that  there is no room for hostility and hate.  the child will be capable of  loving and being a happy individual 
 `Interiors', written and directed by Woody Allen, is by far his most serious work and his biggest departure from his earlier comedies, yet, as the film he did between the major award-winning `Annie Hall' and the comic, but much more serious `Manhattan', it was probably one of the more important milestones marking the changes in his writing. It certainly gave rise to the entire popular and critical hubbub about preferring his earlier, `funny' movies; an attitude Allen parodies himself in `Stardust Memories'.  In spite of the fact that I can detect not one hint of a joke in `Interiors', this does not mean Allen has abandoned his core subjects of sex, death, creative freeze-up, parents, and relationships between partners. Diane Keaton, for example, plays a character almost identical to her role in `Manhattan', a New York literary figure. In `Manhattan', she is a successful book editor. In `Interiors', she is a successful poet married to a less successful novelist and teacher, very similar to the character played by Michael Murphy in `Manhattan', to whom she plays mistress. One of the many little subplots which spills over into sexual misdirection is Keaton's husband, played by Richard Jordan, virtually raping Keaton's actress sister, played by Kristin Griffith.  The story is incredibly spare. Aside from two suicides and the rape, practically nothing happens other than dialogue. Unlike so many of Allen's other movies, even the location is anonymous. While a keen eye will spot some unobvious New York City scenes and the suburban locations are not hard to assume to be Long Island, `New York' manages to stay out of this movie as a character. The very spare set decoration is an essential part of this story, as part of the sense of the title, `Interiors', comes from the occupation of the central character played by Geraldine Page, whose role is the mother of three daughters (Keaton, Hurt, Griffith) and the wife of a lawyer played by E.G. Marshall. Marshall's character creates the basic situation driving the movie when he announces he has decided he needs to live alone, apart from his wife.  Of course, the movie would be incredibly shallow if the whole story was about living in bare white Manhattan co-ops and equally spare Long Island beach houses. The relations between the eight star roles are certainly enough to spin all sorts of symbolism meaning this, that, but I will try to keep speculation to a minimum.  While the parents separation and Page's suicides are the external forces driving the story, the `interiors' story seems to be the fact that with the possible exception of Maureen Stapleton, Marshall's post-separation girlfriend, not one of the characters interact with any of their family members with any empathy or feeling until the suicides precipitate an external need for action. Stapleton's difference from the other characters stands out in that she is the only lead character who is not part of this family of highly disconnected people.  I am hard pressed to think of any playwright or filmmaker with whom to compare this work. It is totally free of the kind of energy common to most American filmmakers, who, except for my other hero director, Stanley Kubrick, seem to be uncomfortable if more than ten seconds goes by without strong words or action showing up on the screen. It is also totally free of the kind of obvious imagery we see from Bergman or Fellini. We may not know to what they are alluding, but we are darn sure they have hidden a message somewhere in those wild strawberries or that giant fish. The closest I can come may be some of the plays of Eugene O'Neill and Tennessee Williams. I am less familiar with Ibsen, but I suspect there may be some influence from that quarter as well.  If for no other reason, this movie is a delight to see the workings of such a great ensemble cast perform together. This is by far the youngest appearance I recall seeing of Sam Waterston and we probably see far too little of Marshall, Stapleton, Page, and Keaton in really serious work.  Other reviewers have amply commented on the great skill and beauty of the cinematography. I will interject a small concern that some of the scenes were a bit too dark, not that anything but the dialogue was very important in most scenes.  This is a very hard movie to recommend. While Allen has done other movies with very serious themes such as `The Purple Rose of Cairo', `Crimes and Misdemeanors', `September' and `Husbands and Wives', this movie is about as far from his center of gravity based on humor as you can possibly imagine. Therefore, if you are simply amused by his movies, you may want to take a pass on `Interiors'. On the other hand, if you like the way Allen treats his core subjects, you should really see this movie at least once. For died in the wool Allen fans, you probably need to watch it about once every two years to see what new insights it gives on Allen's art. 
  This is one of the best smooth jazz CD's Ive heard, particularly the duet with Mel Torme. All of the selection are excellent and the back up group, especially Gerry Mulligan is superb.  A must have CD 
 I have been trading for 15 years (full time) and I have my own trading system which I have developed. I find this book to be one of the best books ever written on the subject 
 Anyone even remotely associated with analysis, as either a patient, friend of a patient, or an analyst himself, should read this very informative and fascinating book.  Clear and well-written, Masson does a wonderful job of  exposing the clique of therapists who get rich by deceiving their patients,  pretending to care and asserting knowledge they simply don't possess.  A  very engrossing book that explores a heretofore closed society 
 Don't get me wrong, I found a lot of Relient K's earlier music fun to listen to but I think this is the album that helped them stand out from many other cookie cutter Christian Bands out there.  Their lyrics have improved greatly from the more juvenial themes on the previous albums.  I believe this is the way Christian Music should be... not over preachy and dealing with life issues from a Christian perspective.  I do enjoy worship albums that sing about God but it is nice to also have groups like Relient K that deal with the day to day things we all go through.  It is also nice that this album is accessable to a wider audience then just the Christian subculture.  I think the youth of today need more artists like Relient K as role models to counter what the music industry has been puting out in recent years.  Also if you like this check out the "Apathetic EP" it follows the same style plus includes accustic versions of some of their hits.  
 In this very readable book, John Randolph Price discusses the secret  school, the master teacher and the inner classroom where you can win your  wings. He shares insights received from within on issues like  self-realization, wholeness, the ego and the raising of consciousness  individually and worldwide, also proposing ways in which the reader may  write their own textbook through similar dialogues with the divine within.  Uplifting and inspiring reading and contains a variety of useful  meditations 
 A very compelling read.  My wife and I both read it and loved it.  We picked up another novel by Mr. Iles and are looking forward to it.  It is definetely worth your time 
 Thank you Dr. Hale for an excellent text on an issue of critical importance! This is a great text for teachers, administrators and parents 
 You get Trent Tomlinson's aptly-titled COUNTRY IS MY ROCK.  Some songs on here, you can picture being covered by Metallica.  Others harken straight to the days of Merle Haggard and George Jones.   It's a grab-bag where every prize is a lyrical/melodic treasure.  Tomlinson's got the right mix of attitude, tenderness, and just-don't-give-a-damn to pull off a country/rock album of this caliber.  Country music has always been based upon a turn of a phrase, and Tomlinson and his co-writers have a definite knack for it.   "The sunbeam hit the Jim Beam and ricocheted off a bottle of coke," he sings on "Angels Like Her" ("send guys like me straight to Hell").   Later: "I ain't gonna do that, no not 'til the next time."   Even the slightly-cliched title track ("Give me some Hag, give me the Possum, with screamin' guitars on top/'Cause country is my rock") has a deeper subtext, if you wanna listen that closely.  I reccommend it--good country music has always been about subtlety.   Great country music, however, has always been about a blend between catchy melodies and thoughtful lyrics.   That's where COUNTRY IS MY ROCK falls (or, if you will, soars).   Certainly one of the strongest debuts in quite a while (following on the heels of Ray Scott's MY KIND OF MUSIC and Jamey Johnson's THE DOLLAR), Tomlinson's debut record is about to become a hit-maker.   But more than that, it is a true, honest, genuine country record, with enough rockin' attitude to make sure you crank the speakers way up, roll the windows down, throw your arm around your girl...or put another quarter in the jukebox and hold tight to your beer.   This is an album you don't wanna miss 
 I like coltrane and i like some "smooth" jazz...this album for me is the perfect balance of both sounds.  branford and nem bring an honest, hard-played effort to this recording...they did an outstanding job of creating some music that is fresh, invigorating and spirited but still remains withing the realms of what passes for Traditional. i cant compare this to coltrane and i wont compare this to boney james...but i think both of them would greatly appreciate much of this album. REQUIEM is an excellent cd...i enjoy it immensely. comparing this to his other recordings, this is the best one to my liking, so far 
 Solomon Kane is a religious adventurer, who has dedicated his life to battling evil in the name of God.  He is an eccentric who carries pistols, rapier (sword), and an iron bound Bible.  Solomon Kane is Robert E. Howard's most famous charactor after Conan the Cimmerian.  Solomon travels all over Europe and Africa fighting vampires, sorcerers, and insane psycotics.  This issue of Baen's R.E.H. series is the longest, but it is worth it.  "The Wings in the Night" is my favorite story, about Solomon Kane fighting harpies from ancient Greek mythology.  Other good ones are "Hills of the Dead", about flying vampires, and "Red Shadows".  All of these books are worth buying because Robert E. Howard is a good writer.  If you enjoy this book, try All the others in this series 
 Sidney Hook analyzes the two philosophers utilizing opposition among Hegelian and Marxist theory: ethical idealism, dialectics, and continuity. This allows the reader to adopt the differences between the two influential  authors,thereby introducing major theories written by Marx and Hegel. The  remaining chapters interject comparisons between Karl Marx and esteemed  German philosophers who studied Hegel, contributed or correlated with  Marxist philosophy. Overall, the text forms an essential basis to the  understanding and development of Marxist philosophy, and the struggles of a  young-Hegelian in the nineteenth century 
 maybe not as practical as it comes off.  We love the idea of standing back and watching kids grow and learn completely at their pace and in their own manner.  After all, they figured out how to roll over, stand up, walk, etc. at their own pace and without any intervention or instruction from us. However, reading (not necessarily in this book) about children who do not figure out how to read until ten, eleven, or even twelve (with the argument "but then, man, what readers they are!"), is really quite upsetting.  And you can't intervene, even this once, because you could upset the self-esteem of the kids.   I'm just not so sure about that.  Oh, math and cooking, history and computer games, those do seem to be great ways for kids to encounter the subject material and truly learn it out of fascination.  But not to be able to read for all those precious years?  I don't care how voracious you then turn out, you've missed quite a bit. Having said that, unschooling figures into our curriculum plan in that the children have a say.  If they want more dinosaurs, so be it.  Worms are boring? Just one week, then. It's an interesting book to read.  The author is powerfully enchanting and persuasive.  I don't mean to dismiss the book as a whole.  I intend only to warn against too much unschool 
 This is one of three books assembled by Emery based on material generated during the production of the television series "The Directors" on the Encore Movie Channel. The others are The Directors: Take Two and Directors Take Two: In Their Own Words. Emery's role was to posed the questions to which the directors responded and then edit transcripts of the given programs televised. Literally, the directors speak for themselves. That is to say, Emery (wisely, I think) eschews the standard Q & A format. Some readers will be especially interested in specific directors; others will be more interested in specific films; still others (I among them) will be interested in both the directors and their films. Predictably the quality of the various directors' responses varies, sometimes significantly. For example, in this volume, for whatever reasons, Spike Lee's and Lawrence Kasdan's comments on their individual films are far more insightful than are those of Robert Wise and Sydney Pollack. However, because Emery also poses several specific subjects to which directors are asked to respond (e.g. "Why [Wise] Decided to Produce His Own Films" and "How Does [Pollack] Choose His Projects?"), Wise and Pollack are able to share with the reader perspectives and opinions that are probably otherwise unavailable. I was especially pleased to learn that Richard Donner considers Inside Moves (1908) "one of my greatest, dearest films." Featuring John Savage, David Morse, Diana Scarwid, and Amy Wright among an ensemble cast, this film is one I include on my own list of the very best which few people have seen or even know of. One of Emery's most effective devices is "The Conversation," a section which introduces each director in his own words. I am grateful to Emery for not intruding (as editor) on the flow of information provided in each chapter. Sure, several portions of the book's narrative could have been "tightened up" but, in that event, I think the book would have lost much of its flavor and, worse yet, its vitality and spontaneity 
 This was one of the better books I've read on marriage.  The chapters are short and cover a variety of topics on improving your relationship, particularly as a wife - not just, if you do this, he will talk, but rather helpful lifetime suggestions for treating your spouse with the upmost respect and admiration.  There is much to learn from this book and I appreciated the 'realness' of the authors.  Thanks for being upfront with wives Connie & Nancy 
 I had to read this for my English/Theater class, and I found it to be extremely compelling and profound.  Our teacher told us that Brecht doesn't want to evoke an emotional response, but even so, I was strongly moved by  the events that transpire, and Kattrin's ultimate sacrifice.  I also had to  compare David Hare's version with the translations of Manheim and Bentley,  and I found that Hare's was the sharpest because of the way he distills the  dialogue down to its core.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in  theater, literature, or life 
 Let's face it.  This is a great lens. But, I want to warn you about Adorama. I highly recommend that you choose a better vendor.  Adorama is SLOW. They don't respond to emails. They took a week to ship my lens when they said it was in stock. Their customer service is non-existent. Their prices are no better than anyone else. Almost every time I've ordered from them they have contacted me to try and sell me more stuff. (Which further delays shipping) A totally unprofessional organization. I for one will never order from them again. Good luck if you do 
 This is phenomenal. I've seen Kamelot twice, and both times the electrifying energy and stage presence was incredible, so I thought it'd be impossible to capture that kind of experience and properly reproduce it, but I was wrong. Khan sounds fantastic as always, and Kamelot put on a stellar show. A must have for any Kamelot fan, or any metal fan in general! 
 This is the first serious book i have read about race and I learnt alot about the early evolution of ape and man and how the development of DNA testing proceeded to reach its current accurate stage of been able to differentiate not only individuals but races. This book covers 3 basic topics in order- 1) a historical account of how ancient civilizations like Aztecs, Egytians and Romans etc recognised and treated the racial groups in their empires.    2)Early anthropolgy and its disputes between its famous scientists, leading to DNA methods that prove the birthdates of man-ape and modern man. 3)Showing how real race differences exist today, in sport, medicine and measured IQ. Also examples of how race can be integrated into modern societies by either Meritocracy, Affirmative Action or EthnoStates. The author Sarich? is occasionally a bit glib in some of his remarks but there is nothing controversial or heretical in this book.  Both authors do get a bit personal with their ideological opponents but anyone with any interest in DNA/race is aware of the ideologies that some vehemently proscribe to in the name of denying race. I really enjoyed this book and although i would have liked it to contain more data on the modern race groupings it really brought my understanding of race and evolution into the new millennium 
 I had no idea how to program, but in just three days after reading this book I was able to accomplish such a task.  I loved the classroom setting.  The feedback from the other students in the class were very helpful.  Sometimes I would say "man that person is an idiot", while other times I would be like "good point".  While reading this book, I even raised my hand a few times.  :)  If you read this book and don't understand every concept, you should find something else to do 
 This is a very sad (and very funny at times) story told through an uplifting voice of a resilient child.  It left me with a little more faith in the human spirit.  The audio book read by the author is also very very good.  You can actually hear the songs and how people talk in the story 
 I was totally amazed with this movie experience. "Piccadilly" was released in l929, just as talkies were coming into vogue, but when you watch this beautifully restored movie, you'll be amazed at what genius/producer E.A. Dupont and his cast and crew did. Cameraman Werner Brandt and set designer, Alfred Junge, stun the viewer with the intricate camera shots and movements. The camera passes over a row of women in the club's dressing room as they put on their make-up...then the camera tracks former Ziegfeld hotcha dancer, Gilda Gray, as she performs her routine. Later, you see Anna May Wong, dancing down in the scullery of the club, and to no one's surprise she is transformed into an Oriental beauty and becomes a smash hit. While all the attention from film buffs and historians is being lavished on Wong, I thought the voluptuous, beautiful and sexy Gilda Gray was just as good. She was famous/notorious for her Shimmy Dance and which made her millions before the Great Depression wiped her out. Here, you watch her in ravishing gowns, dresses, jewels, hairstyles, furs and she comes across bigger than life. A real woman and not one of those flat-chested flappers who were all the vogue at the time. Wong plays the quiet, deep ShoSho with fascinating mastery. In many shots, she looks exactly like Louise Brooks with her page boy hairstyle. The movie itself is enormously expressionistic, surreal and lit magnificently. Each scene is like a painting by a master. One of the extras is the clumsy, akward ten-minute spoken prologue--a nod to the talkies. The movie begins with striking elan as the credits are painted on the sides of double-decker buses in London's Piccadilly Circus. TimeLine has done another masterful job of bringing this long forgotten treasure out into the real world. Another extraordinary movie treasure presented by TimeLine is "The Olive Thomas Collection," another must-see for fans of all persuasions--whether you're a silent buff or not. Bravo to Gilda, Anna and Piccadilly 
 I read this book in a day and a half.  It was an unusual way to approach a book about scientific research, because it really reads like a novel.  I am fascinated with this story, and I would reccommend anyone interested read it 
 My personal opinion is that this book will be forever a classical deed. It is not just a unbiassed philosophical interpretation. Much more, with this book the reader can grasp the whole picture which include and the social-economical, political, religious or military circumstances under which a particular philosophy has flourished.  Previously I read this book in Macedonian and Serbian language. This is my third time reading it. This book is my Bible 
 I wanted to re-read Salems Lot for some time, and finally did so recently. Imagine my surprise when I discovered how good it was! It's been maybe 25 years since I last read it and I still enjoyed every page (well, most of them). I must say that Steve's early stuff-Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Shining, The Stand--are still some of his best. His style is tighter now, and deeper, but the early stories were just genuinely creepy 
 This is a wonderfully evocative book of the times of Moses the man.  It parallels the awesome "THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years" by Richard Patton.   Both these books create a reality around the historical figures that is sadly lacking in the traditional texts.   Both these books are rich food for thought and highly recommended 
 Georgia Magistrate MacLaren Yarbrough is visiting the Scottish Highlands for two weeks but her companion is not her beloved husband Joe Riddley but her friend Laura MacDonald.  Joe thinks it is safe to take a fishing vacation with his son and two grandsons because Mac won't have any mysteries to solve or trip over dead bodies.  Little does he knows that his worst fears will be realized when a heartless killer tries to murder Mac.  The mystery begins when Mac overhears a person on their tour arguing with the brother-in-law of the laird of Auchnager about a business deal.  Before that incident that argumentative individual acted like he was another tourist on a holiday jaunt.  While visiting a local church one of the tourists is found lying in a coffin inside the holy facility, the victim of murder..  Mac immediately assumes the laird's brother-in-law did the deed until that poor soul winds up in a second coffin.  Without meaning to, Mac observes her fellow tourists and asks questions to try to bring the culprits to justice though she ends up feeling sorry for them even though they killed somebody.  Patricia Sprinkle's latest Thoroughly Southern mystery, although placed in the Scottish Highlands, is still a down home, at times hilarious cozy. This is a mystery Agatha Christie would be proud to claim as her own.  The intricate plotting and the eccentric cast of characters are just two of the reasons that DID YOU DELIVER THE CORPSE? is a one sitting reading experience.  The heroine is eminently likeable and her homespun wisdom instantly endears her to the audience who will want this grandmotherly person to adopt them.  Harriet Klausne 
 I originally purchased this product as a gift for a friend from Anthropologie and I am glad to see it is not a unique as I first thought. It has great color photographs of almost every cupcake and is entirely devoted to cupcakes! The recipes are easy and simple and I would highly recommended this book for cupcake lovers and cake decorators. 
 As a speaker Im interested in books on the topic and this is kind of that as it is for people before the public who want to get noticed and as the title says 'win the crowd'. The author details many of his techniques as a magician and he is obviously qualified to talk on the subject. I found the work pretty interesting, at time fascinating but for most of us not sure how relevent. If you're interested in the topic though it is worth taking the time to read. 
 ... this the best book I have read in my entire life and I am not just saying that because I am a BIG Plus One fan!! Lets just say that Jason is a man after Gods own heart, just like David in the Bible. This book has touched my life in an unexplainable(sp.) way!! .. 
 Reason cannot be labeled conservative or leftist.  Nor is it an extremist libertarian magazine like Liberty, fawning over Ayn Rand.  It bases its commentary on the assumption that, if we have some faith, our chaotic culture will lead somewhere good.  But if we try to monitor and control it excessively, we will dampen human creativity and end up muddled and conflicted.  Reason takes on all aspects of culture and assumes an international perspective.  Its arguments are laid out carefully but contain a percolating sense of indignation at our increasingly repressive environment.  At the same time, they are more informative than polemical; each report is grounded in specifics - quotes, anecdotes, studies.  This is the most intelligent and inquiring "political" journal available.  If only it came out more often 
 Besides the bible, no other book has had a profound impact on my life. This was a reccomended reading for one of my bible classes. I came to understand the message of the cross like never before. I dissagree with the comments that gave it a one star. The Cross will never been the center of performance based religion, but still there are several legalist out there that believe that we should preach the law and use hell as a scare tactic to get people converted. To say that this book is bad is propersterous. Many evangelical Christians would dissagree. I have read several books and if I would recomend one book to read in your life, this would be it. Read it and you will be amazed!  
 This is the old father, the old artificer, of all 20th century short stories.  Each story is a gem, and together they tell like a rosary.  "The Dead," is by itself a masterpiece which resonates long after you've finished it.  Dubliners is Joyce's most accessible work, readable and enjoyable without losing any of its deeper nuances.  
 Bones is one of my favorite TV series. This one episode I missed so I had to get it to keep on track. Great show even if you have never seen it from the begining 
 same ideals I have read time and time again,. nothing new and it cost to much 
      Ever think about how much time most of us spend taking care of our skin?  We use potions, creams, and masks on our faces to keep complexions glowing but often neglect our hair save for a quick shampoo and blow dry.  Then, all of a sudden, we look in a mirror and realize these tresses need a treatment!        Let's face it, blow drying, hot rollers, curling irons, coloring, the sun all take their toll on even the healthiest of heads.         Hair Mask with Shea Butter is both a treat and a treatment for dry, lifeless, lusterless hair.  Shea Butter is, of course, the key ingredient, working its magic to restore lackadaisical locks.          It's simple - work a palm size dollop through damp hair and leave on for up to 20 minutes.  Then shampoo and rinse hair well.  I'd also recommend using Fekkai's Apple Cider Clearing Rinse.         The results are immediate - what a difference you'll see and feel.         - Gail Cook 
 This powerful documentary is a wonderful tribute to the four young girls whose lives were cut short in the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama on 15 September 1963.  First and foremost, it focuses on their lives, those who knew them, and the events going on in Birmingham while they were growing up.  It doesn't put the entire or primary focus on how they tragically were murdered, although naturally the bombing, the funerals, and the (rather belated) trials of the sick excuses for life who carried out the bombing are covered.  It's a celebration of life, not death.  (There are some brief graphic shots of the post-mortem photos, but as disturbing as these images might be, they carry home the impact of what really happened.)  It really is amazing that their friends, neighbors, and family members were able to retain such dignity and composure even when talking about such sad events and calling to mind people who had such short lives and who died in such an unnatural way.  While they'll be mourning for the rest of their lives, they haven't let the racist murderers destroy their lives.  They've bravely carried on as best they can.  For many young people today, be they white or African-American, the events of the Civil Rights Movement are ancient history.  This documentary brings that struggle to life, using great archival footage and making clear how long these injustices had been going on, showing how the authorities let people get away with discrimination and often even cracked down on nonviolent protests themselves.  They would even turn on people who came to these events as observers, like one photographer who wanted to take pictures of the Freedom Riders getting off of the bus.  We're also treated to footage of an old and decrepit George Wallace claiming he wasn't a racist, that he's changed, that his best friend in the world, whom he's travelled all over with, is African-American.  (This guy, Ed, did not look or act like someone who were Wallace's best friend when he was coaxed on-camera; the footage of Wallace claiming he'd changed was pretty unconvincing and seemed as though he were patting himself on the back and rewriting history.)  It really makes the struggle these brave people went through seem real, significant, meaningful, not just something that happened in the distant past and which is no longer relevant.  It's hard to believe that these things were going on only a few decades ago.  The opening and closing segments are very, very moving and powerful, and really give the viewer a sense of all that was lost that September day.  These were beautiful promising young girls who were loved by all and who loved everybody, and they were caught up in the middle of a racist society that hated and wanted to kill those who were different, murdered by people who were so filled with hate that they would even murder children.  They could have been doctors, lawyers, human rights advocates, teachers, writers, scientists, or just ordinary people who made a difference in their communities and who lived fine upstanding lives.  Instead they're remembered as civil rights martyrs, and people are left to ponder what might have been 
 Another great season and performance from Carroll O'Connor and the gang.  I hope Sony continues to release the rest of the series, including Archie Bunker's Place 
 I just bought my fourth copy of this book -- I've given away my others and I had to read it again.   "Traveler" is not the kind of book that will change your life with its insights,  but it does so completely capture an ordinary man's crazy quest to finish the right book (he starts 10 different beginnings of books!)  and is so astoundingly creative that it  feels fresh and relevant, even after multiple reads.   There is really no other book like it.  If you like unusual books and have better-than-average patience, I encourage you to give this book a try.  
 Dodge does an excellant job explaining warfare and tactics of the period. He doesn't focus on the personal peculiariaties of the people involved as do modern books. Excellant primer on Alexander's conquests and warefare of the ancient world 
 After hearing Tech was coming out with a new cd, i was thrilled. And i'm glad that i got this cd. Every song on this cd was awesome. The three hardest songs on the cd to me were "Come Gangsta", "Caribou Lou", and "Running Out Of Time". I have to say, having just about every other Tech CD, I think this one was his best effort, Tech is one of the realest in the game and it's a shame that he doesn't get the respect he deserves because of his appearance, because he is an individual.   If you like this CD, you'd prolly also like a few of his old ones, "Anghellic" and "Absolute Power"  Don't Hesitate to buy this CD! you won't regret your purchase 
 When many people think of hip hop today, they think of boring, annoying mainstream rap artists such as 50 Cent, Chingy, and Nelly. I cant stand any type of rap played on MTV or the radio. In fact, I dont really even consider myself much of a hip hop fan. My cd collection is mostly just rock, and filled with cds like CKY, In Flames, H.I.M., Killswitch Engage, Malevolent Creation, etc. Still, Del the Funky Homosapien is not a rapper to ignore. Although this isnt as good as the masterpiece 'Both Sides of the Brain', its still a must have with great songs. Although this is a bit of an old album, it was ahead of its time, and holds up remarkably well even today. In fact, its one hundred times better than the junky hip hop being played today. No wonder why it has had such an awful repetutation lately. For anyone with an open mind, though, this is a must have. I would check out 'Both Sides of the Brain' first, though. 
 Lust for Life has been and remains my favorite book.   A fictional biography of Van Gogh, the great artist who 'cut his ear off', is not only well written, but a great motivator.  Stone's sensitive and entertaining of Van Gogh's life helps provide some anchors in a search for meaning. What is truly impressive is that Van Gogh, despite his near 'silver spoon' origins and strong family connections with the art World, persisted in doing his own thing. He used to starve, while using his allowance for canvas and paints. And that too without knowing that he will be one of the Masters. This belief in self was truly insane.  I am not courageous enough to follow such a path, nor have a comparable passion (or talent) to focus on. But this book helps in defining what life can be aimed at, and hence provides a meaning to life. 
 My daughter got this as a gift for her 2nd birthday. Not only does she love putting the puzzles together - and double the fun being two-sided - her 4 yr old sister also enjoys it. It is useful to teach more complex concepts to our 4 yr old, such as 2 triangles make a square, 4 triangles make a rectangle. Both girls really enjoy this toy, as with all Melissa and Doug toys, it is very well made and will withstand abuse. Just wish it was easier to fit the plastic cover on, we can't seem to fit the shapes neatly to close easily, especially in a hurry. A minute inconvenience. A great toy 
 I really enjoyed this book. It was very moving, sad, and inspirational. It was well written and organized and I continue to wonder about how they are doing today and if they are all OK.   
 This book was recommended by none other than Stephen King, his best book pick for 2005 in Entertainment Weekly.  His last Best Book pick was Vernon God Little, so I had some trepedation going in.  Readers should not be put off by the first 22 pages.  They come off as a fey literary novel about English sisters.  Boring, right?  But the book picks up speed from there and has everything a good book should: 1) Intersting characters, 2) Great writing, & 3) a sense of humor.  Atkinson's writing is top notch while her characters continue to surprise.  Jackson Brodie, a PI with the same bad luck as any American PI including a troublesome ex-wife, somebody out to kill him, and investigative problems, is a sympathetic character who we don't even meet until Chapter 4, 45 pages in.  That's the beauty of this book, there is no hurry, characters are developed as you go, yet the story moves along at a nice pace.    
 I remember my father listening to these songs way back in the late 70s. After hearing them over and over, I got to like them too.  Whenever I hear them on the radio now, it always brings good memories.  My favorites "Easy," "you bring me up" and "Sail On."  These songs are classics.  Excellent melodies and vocals 
 No sophomore jinx here - this entire collection is stronger than the debut!  I remember Sade debuting the smashing lead single IS IT A CRIME during the Live Aid concert.  This song is one of my favorite Sade singles - it just grabbed me from the opening refrain of the horns and builds until Sade's emotionally climactic ending.   THE SWEETEST TABOO - this was the biggest hit single off of the album if I'm not mistaken & with good reason - it's a catchy love song with a strong beat that makes one's head bob  WAR OF THE HEARTS - melancholy song about being in love but knowing that you have to let the person go, very moody track    YOU'RE NOT THE MAN - sad love song in which the title aptly describes the disillusionment of being in love and discovering that the person is not who you thought he was    JEZEBEL - like the Sally track on the debut album, this song tells a story about a young girl from the wrong side of the tracks & what she does to survive    MR. WRONG -  I love this track, it's very groovy (for lack of a better word), love the musical production & the fact that the song is short, sweet & to the point    PUNCH DRUNK - beautiful instrumental track, flows so perfectly with the rest of the album    NEVER AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TIME - another really groovy track, the music makes you want to dance, this single was also a big r&b hit    FEAR - very thematic song, excellent storytelling within a song    TAR BABY - probably my least favorite song on the disc but again the music production makes up for that  MAUREEN - catchy tune & all these years later, I'm still not sure if Maureen was a friend or truly an old car  I'd highly recommend this disc as this is a strong offering of songs from Sade and is a "no skipping required" cd in my collection. If I had to make a choice, I'd recommend this disc over the debut to those unfamiliar with Sade because the songs are stronger. 
 This is a good cd, not quite as good as other Christopher Lawrence titles, but decent all the same. I see a few reviews claiming the cd is copy protected, well it is, but it's very easy to get around. All tracks currently reside on my pc and my ipod. 
 My 11 year old almost missed the school bus this morning because he just had to finish this book.  If you have a son that likes sports books, this is a sure bet.  My son kept saying, "This is awesome!" and "I hope there's a sequel." all the way through 
 Absolutely the best of the four (you can guess the other three) books we took, because this on focuses on the off-beat and the green.  Use it to locate the indepth Costa Rica, the one that gets you away from everyone else and makes you feel happy about it 
 Ms. Meagher's book is well documented, insightful and detailed.  She skillfully takes the reader through discrepancies in the Warren Commission report and lays it all out for the reader.  Her conclusions are based on facts that are very clearly presented, and on common sense.  At no time did I get the impression that this book was attempting to influence my views on the work of the Warren Commission.  Ms. Meagher spells it out for the reader step by step 
 THE WRONG MAN is the first novel I've read by John Katzenbach.  I thought it was a very effective thriiller.  Katzenbach is plainly a very skilled writer and I thought he did a very good job building the tension.  This is a good page-turner, albeit a slightly verbose one.    The plot of THE WRONG MAN concerns a stalker who grows increasingly violent, eventually threatening the family of the young woman he's obsessed with.  This admittedly sounds like a very familiar plotline.  Indeed, the first 350 pages of this novel are relatively predictable.  However, for the last hundred pages, Katzenbach takes this plot into a direction that I did not expect.  Eventually, the family hatches a remarkably convulted and unethical plan that I will not reveal here.  I personally didn't find this plot development to be particularly credible at all -- I couldn't imagine such a plan working in the real world.  This is also a rather odd novel in that the three main characters are each experiencing a mid-life crisis.  Katzenbach devotes a lot of prose to their inner thoughts and emotions -- too much time, in my opinion.  I understand that Katzenbach is trying to make a point here about the emptiness of suburban, middle-class life, but this theme has been done to death. I eventually grew rather weary of these characters, who struck me as somewhat humorless and unhappy about their lives.     Overall, though, THE WRONG MAN is a good literary suspense novel.  If you like this book, you might want to consider the work of Peter Abrahams and Joy Fielding, who write in a similar style 
 The author is to be commended for an intelligent and fair-minded work  about the apparations at the Grotto of Lourdes, and the events which took  place for the 50 or so years after that event. It's difficult in this  extremely secular time to present a cogent history of a time and place  where faith and miracles appeared to be nothing out of the ordinary, such  as this backward region of France in the mid-nineteenth century. Like most  Catholics of my time, I knew some general things about events at Lourdes,  but the detail included in this book is astonishing! At times the work is a  bit tough going, but it is always interesting and informative. The author  maintains a carefully-orchestrated neutrality during the entire course of  her book, and that alone is commendable. It's worth reading if for nothing  else than to see how entire lives were immersed in religion and belief in  the hereafter and the manifestation of God's benevolence towards the world  through the intercession of His mother. You don't have to be of any  particular religious persuasion to be awed by the simple faith of many of  these people, and the trust they had that there were still times when  miracles happened. I envy them their belief, and I applaud the author for  not condescending to them. She has done a marvelous job 
 This book was amazingly helpful in my therapy class. It really brings to life what I shortly hope to be doing for my career. It does not read like a typical text book and is easily understandable and applicable 
  I have learned so much with this book. I recomend it highly to any who gets a gray 
 I'm a long-running Virgin customer, but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry, and so I've had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier (including non-US). Previous Virgin phones I've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255. My 8610 still works, but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.  Let's start with the positives:  -Very compact design. This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet, I sometimes forget it's there.  -For the cost, it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support, 10 MB for downloads (32 total), speakerphone, web capability, comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices. Very long battery life, and fast charging. For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight. It might have... interesting... effects.  -Uses the Sprint network. I've found this to be very reliable in my area, and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors.   -Call quality is good. Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell, which was also good (my old Kyocera, on the other hand, was garbage).   -UI has a solid, standard design. Predictive text included for messaging. The phone's graphics are a bit odd, but not necessarily in a bad ways.  -Durable. UTStarcom knows how to build to last. This handset is no exception.  -Good library of games, ringtones, and graphics available. Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on...  -Virgin is a very low cost provider. It's no good if you want video on demand, 3G, or whatnot. But for just making calls/texting now and then, you simply can't beat $20/3 months. No annual contract as well, which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well).  On the downside:  -Keys are a bit small. This is typical of ultra-thin handsets. They are a bit stiff as well, which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily, bad because typing is more of a pain).  -Virgin's web browser is lame. Their web service costs extra, and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). You can browse basic html, and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.  -No bluetooth built-in, though this is to be expected.  -No camera either, also to be expected. This can actually be a good thing, since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.  Bottom line: this handset is great for the price. There are flaws with it, as with any phone, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. I've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone, but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. This isn't a $200 Samsung T519, and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. Considering the costs, the Slice is an great handset with excellent service, and that is that 
 My husband and I bought this CD after hearing Jane Monheit featured on our local jazz station.  The clarity of her voice on "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" is astounding;  to learn that she recorded this song in one take is even more astonishing.  We enjoy the first half of the CD almost on a daily basis.  The second half of the CD contains some "non-standard" or "non-traditional" tunes, however, and while they are lovely, too, they don't seem to fit in with the rest of the CD.  So, after your mood is set by tunes like "Waters of March" (my absolute favorite song on the CD) and "Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most," you're thrown into a different state of mind with numbers like "A Case of You."  It's just a little jarring, I think.  I'm giving this CD four stars instead of five not because of the quality of Monheit's performance, but for the odd combination of songs.  My husband and I are kicking ourselves for not seeing her live when she was in town last month;  by all accounts, she is an incredible performer -- as good (or better) than she is on her recordings 
 Whether the Earth revolves around the Sun or vice versa should not have been a religious issue such as it was in Copernicus time.  Similarly, whether global warming is due to anthropogenic activities (CO2 emission from humans) or volatility in natural trends should not be a political issue.  But, it is.    A fair warning to reader, this book is extremely data and graph intensive.  Other reviewers have indicated being uncomfortable with that.  Michaels also extrapolates trends (straight line) from extremely volatile data lines that many reviewers  did not believe or understand.  His method, though, is sound.  He uses linear regression to derive the straight trend line to clear out the fog from the data volatility.  Any advanced user of Excel knows how to do that with Excel graphic function.   From Michaels analysis, we gather a few key points you don't read in the press.  First, humans impact on global warming is and will remain small. This is because CO2 has a very small greenhouse effect that is 10 x less than water vapor.   Also, CO2 effect on temperature is logarithmic.  This means that greater concentration of CO2 have a declining incremental impact on rising temperature.  We know that because old fossil records indicated that in the distant past, CO2 concentration was 15 x greater than now; yet, temperatures were only 10 degree Celsius higher than now.   Second, over the next century temperatures can be expected to grow slowly and linearly by no more than 1.5 degree Celsius.  This increase is more a function of long term natural trend than any anthropogenic effect.  Third, ocean levels will not rise much if at all.  The Arctic is loosing ice mass.  Being floating ice, it will have no impact on ocean level.  Meanwhile, the Antarctic is actually gaining ice mass.  And, Greenland ice mass is in balance with stable temperatures.  Any warming at the poles has occurred in the Winters.  Summer temperatures are unchanged (when melting occurs).  Fourth, the weather is not becoming more volatile.  The respective volatilities of temperature,  precipitation, number and intensity of hurricanes, floods, and droughts remain within the norms depicted in long term trends in climate data.  All the above are not just vapid assertions, but the result of thorough referenced data analysis.  Michaels contrasts his data analysis approach with the global warming scaremongering from the press, environmental groups, politicians, and a majority of climate scientists who derive their livelihood from supporting the status quo.  In chapter 10, he cuts apart "The National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change"(also called the USNA).  The USNA selected the two most extreme climate models to develop their scenarios.  As a result, it comes up with temperature and precipitation scenarios that are so far off what is even possible.   Michaels is in the minority as a global warming skeptic, but he is not alone. Michaels has edited another excellent book on the subject "Shattered Consensus: The True State of Global Warming" with 10 other scientists contributors.         
 A Girl Named Disaster was a very good book. In fact it is a Newberry Award Winner. It lets you travel to Africa without leaving home. The book is about a secret murder and a forced marriage, causing a young girl to flee to Zimbabwe. What should have been a short trip turns into a long journey with many challenges. By using the spirits of her elders the young girl finds her way. I liked this book because of the facts brought into the story through writing. Also I became very attached to the characters and beliefs. This is an awesome book and I recommend it for people of all ages 
 I found this book to be very readable.  I disagree with the reviewers who found it to be a "McBook."  It is true that, like most authors, Grisham doesn't always deliver -- but he certainly does in this one!  I couldn't put this book down once I had started.  It is the story of two boys, who see something terrible -- a suicide.  But before that, one of the boys is told something dreadful by the man -- a secret that the mob wants, the police want, the FBI wants.  How the eleven-year old boy deals with that, and the folks who help him, is what this book is about.  It would make a great movie (if iut hasn't already been made into one!).  I enjoyed every word of it 
 This is the perfect toy for ages 1-5.  My nephews love these things and the price is a steal 
 I have been reading some of the reviews online for this CD and I am wondering for the P-Funk haters with the state of black music on the radio what do you people expect? I like this double CD because George was going for the old & new sound of today's overproduced and water down sound.The songs I really liked were "Bounce 2 This" a funk jam for the ages,"Inhale Slow","Never Ending Love","Su,Su,Su","Something Stank","Viagra","Paradigm","Gyspy Woman","Whole Lotta Shakin",and "Goodnight Sweetheart,Goodnight".There were some songs I didn't care for songs like "I Can Dance" which went on for too long and "Butt-a-Butt".I wish Mr. Clinton would brought some of his trademark characters to this CD:Sir Nose,Starchild,Dr.Funkenstein,the monkey,The Horny Horns,etc.In short,this is a very good album better than the pervious P-Funk albums in the 90's.This CD is a good start 
 It has only been once in a great while that a thin little tome has taught me so much, and been so much fun.  Before Quantum Physics by Alastair Rae, the last one I remember was Richard Feynmann's QED.  I now feel like I have at least a near understanding of Bell's Theorem, EPR, SQUIDS, and an assortment of things and concepts that were tantalizing but vague until now.  Thank you, Alastair, you're a good teacher.  And, the little surprise at the end, Prigogine's possible answer.  I'd always found him intriguing.  Now I know why 
 If you are a professional MT, I would recommend this book to get some deep tissue pointers and ways to save your body. Think I might get the DVD series too 
 Joyce Meyer strikes an important cord - with a message that inspires regardless of one's religious affiliation. Moreover, Ms. Meyer is herself an example of how a well-positioned sense of self-confidence leads to success. Although I am committed to a different faith than Ms. Meyer - she is a wonderful role model.  I believe strongly that ALL religions and societies need women like Joyce Meyer who have the ability to lead. Ms. Meyer brings a message of faith and strength to women. She is a reminder that women have both the ability and responsibility to play leading roles in all walks of life: At home, in religion, in our communities, in politics, in our schools, and in business. (The reviewer is author of "Top Cops: Profiles of Women in Command" and "Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU." 
 I used this book for a 7 day trip to Shanghai in September 2004.  It gave an excellent overview of the city: what to see, where to go, however, the maps and phrasebook were a disappointment.  The maps lacked the Chinese characters for the street names (the book listed everyting in "pinyon", the Westernized lettering of Chinese words) and since very few people in Shanghai speak English or recognize the Western lettering, we couldn't just point to where we wanted to go.  Instead, we had to get the hotel concierge to write down where we wanted to go, which was very limiting when heading out on day trips.    In addition to this book, be sure to get a good map, complete with Chinese charaters.  Also be sure to pick up a copy of the Rough Guide Mandarin phrasebook, which is an essential resource for ordering in restaurants, getting around town via taxi, asking directions, etc 
 Anyone who is already a fan of Bradley Trevor Greive will not be disappointed by this book.  Using his tried and true formula of combining amusing and unusual pictures from the animal kingdom, along with thoughtful commentary, he manages to convey the deeply profound mixed with a his usual dose of humor.  I bought this book to give to my daughter for her 13th birthday, but ended up giving it to her early when we lost a treasured family pet.  It proved to be a comfort to her, providing perspective and allowing her to smile again.  I highly recommend The Blue Day Book to anyone who's ever had "one of those days" -- and haven't we all 
 I wish I'd had this book years ago when I was raising my children. I tended then to make decisions without even being aware of other options (sometimes, I still do!). The author spells out many options and gives us a framework to think about them. It's too late for me with regard to raising children--but not too late for my children! I will give this book to my adult children, and use the concepts to apply to other decisions in my life 
 Materena Mahi is a professional "house cleaner" struggling with mother-daughter conflict. Materena has always forged the middle path between Tahitian custom and modern pragmatism but struggles when her daughter appears to want to leave the Tahitian part of herself behind. Materena is a matriarch of sorts- friends and relatives avidly seek her opinions because of her commonsense wisdom. But when Leilani takes up with the motorcycle-riding Hotu, gets a job, and applies to University, it is Materena who needs emotional support.  Some reviewers have panned this novel as slow and reinforcing of trite island sterotypes we've seen in Gaughin's Tahiti. In fact,  this book is slow because Tahiti is slow-or at least slower than a lot of places. You'll have to adjust to island time to enjoy this book. If you want a fast paced Grisham novel, this isn't for you. If you want to slow down, authentically experience another culture, and imagine you can feel the South Pacific on your toes, this is a good book.  The islands are a simpler place. It's inhabitants struggle and many of them really do live in fibro board homes and eat the bananas that grow in their yards. I found this book delightful because it stuck to that wonderful reality rather than alluding to a Tahiti that exists on the cover of travel brochures for Americans.  A good read 
 This book was written by a TV comedian on exposing the truth on current affairs.  In Book One, he documented with details how Bush won in the battle of blue and red.  Book Two told of Chalabi was convincingly led to the Iraqi Liberation with sweets and flowers.  	Al presented his finding in an entertaining way.  Our President has the determination to protect American people from terrorist harm with different patriotic measures and acts.  The homeland is safer five years after 9/11 despite the horror plots in Asia and Europe.  This book gives the truth on record with jokes so that readers can check, evaluate and judge the reality of state affairs in the war on terrorism.  Reading this book may help find the answers. 
 Hacking Exposed Cisco Networks" (HECN) by Vladimirov, Gavrilenko, Vizulis and Mikhailovsky is the first book of it's kind to focus entirely on hacking the Cisco product line. The book offers a novel concept, and goes into some undocumented areas, but please do not expect to be seeing the enable-mode router prompt by page 50.   My first impression of Hacking Exposed Cisco Networks is that the book was simply 'rushed' to market. The book begins with an intro by Michael Lynn, who made a name for himself at the 2005 Black Hat Briefings by 'publicly demonstrating the ability to reliably exploit buffer overflows on Cisco routers.' My feeling is that after the Black Hat Briefings, a rush was put on HECN to have it published simply to ride on this wave.   The book is divided into 3 Parts and 1 Appendix and includes a total of 14 chapters.  The first section, Foundations, gives a review of Cisco design models, different security elements (firewall, IDS, VPN and AAA) and examples of real world security issues.    The second section (and the main section of the book) is titled `Hacking the Box' and dives into various methods of penetrating Cisco devices.  The first chapter in this section discusses using different information sources to develop a profile (what to search for on a web search engine, autonomous system discovery, Internet routing servers and tables, etc..).  Next, a 50 page chapter discusses enumerating and fingerprinting Cisco devices.   Subsequent chapters discuss password attacks, SNMP community string attacks, wardialing, IOS exploitation and password cracking.  After penetrating a device, the next chapter shows how to exploit and preserve access.    The last section discusses protocol exploitation, which needs not be focused solely on Cisco devices; most of these attacks are common across all vendors.  This includes chapters on exploiting Vlans, GRE packet injection, EAP-LEAP cracking.  The last chapter discusses routing protocol exploitation including exploits for RIP, EIGRP and BGP.   The Appendix includes listing undocumented Cisco commands.  While these commands can also be found on the web, the book discusses ways to use the commands in context of a hacking exploit.    Some of the items I found useful from HECN:  * Chapter 4 provides a respectable list of AS profiling techniques. Starting on page 108 is an excellent introduction to a tool to help sniff routing updates (the autonomous system scanner).  * Chapter 5 provides a great chart on Cisco specific protocols (page 124). The chapter also has a very good discussion on Cisco fingerprinting.  * Chapter 8 provides a one-of-a-kind discussion on IOS memory dissection. I was extremely impressed by the discussion on stack heaps. The TFTP buffer overflow on page 281 is a great example of where the future of Cisco IOS hacking may lie.  While some believe buffer overflows are soooo 2005, I think believe there is amply room to further explore this within the context of Cisco devices.   HECN also has some weak areas:  * page 24 - mentions all routers support NTP - not true, some of the lower-end IOSs only support SNTP.  * page 28 - mentions `extra flags' for UDP connections. UDP has no flags, but certainly TCP does.  * page 133 - mentions a tool, the "ST-divine tool", as available on the book's website, but the tool is not listed at the book's website.  * Chapters 1 and 3 really don't offer anything new, and only distract from the overall quality of the book.   These and other such typos/editorial mistakes don't distract too much from the overall focus of HECN. The book tries to be a proof-of-concept with many different exploits. One feels that the authors were huddled around a few Cisco boxes, trying whatever exploits they could find to bust the box.  It would be very easy to rack up some routers and switches, copy the configurations provided in the book, and follow them page by page as they perform various hacking techniques.  As an owner of over 50 books dedicated to Cisco, this book goes into an area not covered by any other book in my library.  And, for that fact alone, I have to respect the book.  However, I have to believe that if HECN had only gone through a further round of editing, that the overall structure of the book would be much better.  In the end, I do recommend this book, simply because of the novelty of the subject and due to the amount of effort that is apparent throughout the text.       I give this book 4 pings out of 5: !!!. 
 i dont even know where to begin.   first, the entire thing is written as if it were the denoument. every page feels like the last. it unfolds at breakneck speed with the feeling of a shocked recollection piecing things together as it progresses. the prose is solid and seamless. the story is engrossing and told with incredible uniqueness. we gloss over it again and again, each chapter is like another layer. instead of telling a linear story, faulker tells the same story from each point of veiw, in each dimension, revealing and completing more and more everytime. just brilliantly wrought. A must read for Sound and The Fury fans, this brings you even deeper into Quentins soul than you may be able to handle.  read this book. if you dont want to buy it, read it.   ps. Thomas Sutpen is the shi 
 This review is not probably going to be what one would think for someone who loved Ronald Reagan, because this book was written for people who ignorantly thought he was "the most dangerous man in America". That is the focus of this book in being 'Legacy' which was what his family, friends and administration were dealing with in releasing this book. We knew President Reagan was brilliant, wise, caring, God fearing, moral and a world leader who only comes along in a generation to transform the world, but these letters were meant to convince the narrow minded how wrong they were about him. For someone who adores this gentle man, I found it startling in reading he names Jane Fonda and her husband a traitor, how Democrats lied to gain power while the nation suffered in mirror image of what just happened to Bush 43 and his insight that Jimmy Carter would be a disaster and was a phoney before he even took office. The reason that was startling is Reagan was right about Star Wars, was right about how to topple the Soviet Union without a nuclear war and was right how the key to eastern Europe's freedom was religion, so Reagan being always proven correct has deeper meaning for all of history in his naming people traitors and phoneys. His greatest warning in his letters today are the dangers of a national health care system which will ruin American health care and how it is only a power grab by socialists to gain more control over America for their rule. It will be the 2008 election and Hillary Clinton as part of her agenda is to implement that national health care. Reagan's voice rings eternal in warning America of what is right and what is wrong. I would have enjoyed the book more if the letters would have have been his living legacy of God given wisdom more and less of the facts in trying to prove to ignorant people he really was a good soul. I already knew that like most Americans and we didn't require convincing. The book though proves Reagan was the genuine person on camera or off. He and his lovely wife, Nancy, endured more from their children and petty personalities than anyone ever should have to. Americans owe them an eternal thank you and an even more deeper gratitude to God in guiding this American's life who revolutionized America and the world and whose "shining city on a hill" is still moving the entire world. That is legacy a generation later and I still love that old man 
 I read a lot of spiritual or metaphysical books but this one is definately one of the best, most personally useful ones. I just started it yesterday and although I am only half way through I am so excited by the information within I could not wait to rave about it and recommend it to family and friends. It is so enlightening to me in explaining my negative thought patterns and how programming from childhood has influenced my entire life. No wonder Louise Hay is a guru to so many new age type authors. I am reading sections aloud to my husband. I am underlining passages to re-read later. I see myself so clearly in the examples given as well as other people I love in my life. Although I did not buy this book through Amazon like many others I've read, I would most definately purchase it again for a gift or advise somebody I really cared for that could use this kind of revelation to buy it. My copy is the earlier printing (1984) so I can only assume more recent re-printing dates are at least as good or improved. Do not hesitate. You need to read this book. You deserve it and can really benefit from it 
 The ribbon is very easy to install and produced high quality text on Sony DVD media. One ribbon usually prints a little more than the 40 DVDs stated in the documentation. 
 A terrifically interesting, detailed and well researched book, as it should be since it took 25 years to write.  Clearly, however, the authors fell in love with Oppenheimer and seem to have lost balance and objectivity.  A little like a 1930's cowboy movie; Oppie and friends all wear completly white hats while the enemies are all misguided, ruthless or worse. Nevertheless, it is far and away the most complete and well written biography of Oppenheimer available 
 This album is good, not great, but good.  The late Prince Lincoln, dealt with and was committed to producing thoughtful lyrics and heartfelt melodies.  His solemn yet distinct voice captivates this album, that tries not be typically roots sounding, but offers the elements that make roots reggae a profound sound.  With binghi drums fluent and skanking throughout, some cuts also verge on disco/reggae.  Lincoln offers his own originality throughout.  This album gets 4stars because of the accompanied dubs that are well put together and compliment the lyric versions well. Standout cuts, For Once in My Life, Slave Driver, Blessed Are the Meek 
 Udine Spragg = Becky Sharp (and a damn sight nastier too). 
 I first read this book when I was about 11 and loved it. I thought it was so cool these guys had all these great ideas and equipment to pull them off. The book now reminds me of a simpler time when kids knew how to have fun with their imagination instead of a $400 video game.  I was so glad when I found the book available again. I look forward to when I can give it to my nephew and hope to instill in him the same sense of wonder books such as these instilled in me 
 Great, simple patterns for adults, babies, rugs and more. I especially enjoyed knitting the baby hat in this book 
 I play classical music in the morning at work.  This CD has had more people ask me "What CD is that? - Where did you get it?" than any other in my rather large stack.  This CD's music slips into the background  and provides an atmosphere that is great to think by.  You can have a  discussion while it plays and it doesn't interfere.  The perfect CD for the  working environment 
 In a time of corporate, political and religious scandal this book is an outstanding book about the balance of truth and grace. More importantly it helps provide you confidence to be true to God's purpose and work in you. Read it, think it through and make a difference. The truth is not always popular, and grace is not always the right thing to provide. Read this book, observe life for examples of grace and truth misplaced, tolerance for lies from our leadership, and who is really the victim of unforgiveness. It will shape your perspective and your heart 
 If you are at home and don't want to walk outside (maybe the weather is lousy), this is a perfect 2 DVD set that takes you from a 1 mile walk to a walk with hand-held weights for bone-strengthening and intensity. It can all be done in a small room in front of your DVD player and television.  This is absolutely perfect for anyone getting started in exercise, as it is low impact and takes up no space. Other than possibly wanting to buy two exercise balls which are listed for sale inside the dvd set at about 10 bucks before shipping, you need nothing but this dvd, good shoes and a dvd-player and TV or even just a computer.   When the 1 mile workout is too easy, you can step up to a 2 mile workout. The advantage here is that the PACE and the DISTANCE are set by walking with Leslie and her team. You will know you did the right workout rather than guess if ambling around the block really got your heatrate up and was the right distance for an effective workout. Needless to say, if you don't like walking in bad weather, this is a great thing to keep at home for crummy days with rain, snow, heat or cold. 
 The only thing they forgot to do is put "Love's Holiday", definetley ESSENTIAL for every EWF Greatest Hits Album. But overall, best Greatest Hits Album I've bought 
 This is a quick read of 20 different stories that have historically and tremendously impacted all of us.  This book is inspirational and instructional in content, and although I had heard many of these stories before I gleaned many ideas for my own business.  The other issue I noticed is that these stories impacted the world and they all took place right here in the US, yet they continue to influence globalization today 
 Bobby Brown's third album features some of the best songs to get your groove on to.  Silky Smooth "Good Enough" is my fav on this album.  "Humpin Around" is what always got the party bumpin' while fresh tunes like "Get Away" and "Two Can Play That Game" kept the ladies on the dance floor.  I feel bad for Bobby in what he has gone through but I still think he is the king of hip-hop and R&B.  I wish he would come out and release another album or perform on TV or somethin.  Haven't heard from him in like 5 years.  Why isn't he makin another album?  He was on top and just stops makin music.  Bobby should get back to what he's good at, to help get rid of all the bad attention he gets.  Your still the man Bobby Brown! Don't you forget that 
 I first heard of them when i herad the song "Kryptonite" which i am sure everyone has heard. I liked that song right away. This is a great album. My favorite tracks are Let Me Go, Be Somebody, Right Where I belong, and The Real Life. Give those tracks a listen and you will like this CD too 
 Worth the price for two songs, 'Nicodemus' (left off the original release?) and 'Ark of the Covenant', truly some of the very finest reggae ever made.  All of it is.  
 Nancy Friday asked women from around the world to send in their sexual experiences and fantasies. The result was some of the most provocative reading ever published. If you embarrass easily, this book is not for you. Just about every sexual taboo is mentioned in this book and in great detail. But beyond the fantasies and experiences of these women, are the comments and observations of Nancy Friday herself. This book can be an awakening for any man or woman. An awakening in that, if you have had a certain type of fantasy or experience and feel that you are the only person in the world who has had such, you may learn of others who have had similar ones. Or you may be awakened to fantasies you have never thought of, but after reading the book, find yourself thinking about them, or desiring to do them. I have owned a number of copies of this revealing book only to have different individuals borrow them and never return them. I recall once when I was in a snack bar reading the book, some women noticed it and inquired about its contents. I told them what the book was about and they said, it's very good on my part to be interested in what women think about. They then wanted to read a page, just to see what it was all about. But they didn't end up reading only one page. They kept on reading and reading and reading. I finally had to ask for the book in order to get it back, and half of them were blushing. This isn't a porn book by any means, then again no porn book is even in this ones league!!! For various reasons, I don't own an edition of this book now, but, one reason I don't is that if I did, I know it would only be a short time before someone would want to borrow it, and I'd never see it again. If you enjoy reading about women's real sexual fantasies and experiences, you will want this book 
 I really enjoyed this book, it wasn't completely comprehensive but did give a good overview of Buffet's investment style.  While it didn't go heavily into the analysis of stocks that I would have liked it did describe who influenced Buffet, thanks to this book I was able to pick up some Fisher and Graham and have learned quite a bit.  All in all I would reccomend this book for someone interested in a light biography of Buffet or a little insight into how he makes decisions 
 This book demonstrates the evolution of the Bible as we eventually wound up with it. This is NOT a book for people in possession of a conclusion searching for a premise. It will definitely offend Christian and Hebrew Fundamentalists, but then they have an enormous stake in maintaing their sense of place and livelihood with the status quo. Buy this book for an IMPARTIAL look at the history of what constitutes the bible 
 Incredible acting by the entire cast.  Fabulous passion. Love. Heart ache.  Heart break.  An ending that brought me to tears of joy. You won't be disappointed. 
 Fannie Flagg has written a "Christmas" novel that provides year-round enjoyment. Down-home, Southern hospitality and humor is at its best when Fannie sets it on paper. I was so delighted with "A Redbird Christmas" that I read it twice... once on my own and once aloud to a dear friend with vision impairments. I might just have to find someone else to read it to, because part of the magic of this book is sharing it with someone special 
 This DVD set is amazing. I saw one episode and decided to see the rest. Just seeing what art meant to ancient civilizations captured me. Nigel Spivey presents each civilization in a way that all understand and can relate to. I would recommend this to anyone interested in art or art history, or anyone for that matter 
 A memborable, witty, more realistic twist on the Cinderlla Fable.   A MUST for everyone's DVD library!   Even my husband STILL loves to watch this.... and he's not much into these types of movies!!   Drew does an outstanding job portraying Danielle with spirit,wit,kindness and vulnerability.   Anjelica Huston is perfectly wicked.  Both daughters steal their share of scenes and so does the likable friend-who's-a-boy, of Danielle.  EVERYONE plays their parts will skill and are all memorable.  LOVE the addition of Da-Vinci and his charm.   This DVD will be replaced, when I wear out my current one... 
        I have to say I love this book! It is awsome! I had heard it was boring, slow getting into, stupid and about everything else bad about it you can think of. Those comments were and are the understatements of the year!           I like this book so much because you can relate and feel like your being the character. I also like it because it has something for everyone for kids their is a young character, for men their is a war story, and for women their is a love story.          The story is strong because it has so much agony and yet the family holds through it all. It holds through death, suffering, and through war.          Overall this book is very wishy-washy but it is good none the less!!!  
 An Excellent exposition of the history of astronomy and astrophysics. Mr. Ferris writes with a lucidity and thouroughness not often found in books on this fascinating subject 
 I don't usually listen to country music much, but this CD is the exception. I'm impressed with the vocals and the fact that this man WROTE HIS OWN SONGS. I'll definitely be checking him out live. He is one to watch 
 This was a very good book.  I just kept turning the pages.  This is the first I have read by this author and I was very impressed. After about the first 100 pages it really takes off.  I am glad a friend loaned it to me.  To bad it tok me over a year before I opened it.   
 Kate Atkinson is a masterful writer and this is her best book.  She interweaves the case histories of the title so cleverly that when you finish the novel you are amazed by her skill and rare ability to bring diverse and sometimes eccentric characters vividly and compellingly to life.  Her new novel, due this month, promises to bring some of these characters alive again. Writers today rarely combine suspense, characterization and plot with such brilliance 
 This film is treated something like the lost child in the canon of director Woody Allen's career.  As if he would have to apologize for this instead of, say, "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion".  What Allen attempted here in his directorial debut is groundbreaking.  This is the first example I can recall of a director telling his film in mock-documentary style, later employed by Albert Brooks and perfected by Christopher Guest.  Allen proves himself to be not only a great comic visualist but there are great verbal puns here as well.  The conceit of the film is a gas.  We're supposed to believe that Allen's Virgil Starkwell, an inept dweeb of a criminal, if not among the FBI's most wanted does cause Mr. Hoover some sleepless nights.  The gags here are rapidfire but I wouldn't spoil it for those who are uninitiated.  My favorite being,though, is Virgil orchestrating a prison break with a gun he's fashioned out of soap during a rainstorm.  All this failed effort leaves him with is a hand full of soap lather.  Also, noteworthy in the cast is the late Janet Margolin as Virgil's faithful wife.  Margolin basically plays straight woman to Allen but it's a shame this gifted actress who was so good in "David and Lisa" didn't have a more substantial film career 
 This whole CD is so totally fulfilling and then it is topped off with a beautiful vocal by Barbra... and my favorite Pavarotti!  I listen to this so often I'm afraid I'll wear it out.  I highly recommend it.  Barbra has  once again put her heart and soul into it's beautiful score.  You will love  it. Kudos also to Barbra's longtime friend Marvin Hamlisch.  What a team! JMHO //(*_*)\ 
 Even though I like the first album even better, this Montrose best-of is still the best place to pick up some of the forgotten songs from the group's later years. Montrose, along with Nazareth, Head East, Ted Nugent, Mountain, Grand Funk Railroad, Bad Company, Foghat, Humble Pie, Robin Trower, Free, Blue Oyster Cult, and all of the Southern Rock bands, provided the groundwork for what we now call heavy metal. Sammy Hagar is in the best form of his career, and Bob James is pretty terrific, too. Ronnie Montrose himself really pours it on all over and is more influential than most people ever realized. This really is the ultimate Montrose anthology 
 You all know him. Bun B is one half of the Underground Kingz, better known by the acronym of UGK. The other half of UGK faced multiple legal troubles, leaving Bun B to hold down the fort while Pimp C was doing a bid. In order to keep UGK's name alive, Bun B guested on almost every Southern hip-hop album to come out since 2003(that is NOT an exaggeration), all while preparing his own solo debut. Trill is the outcome of that; so how does it fair when compared to other classics in UGK's catalogue?  Incredibly well. This is one of the best albums I've heard in quite awhile, and definitely one of the most solid Southern albums I've heard in years. While some Southern artists only get over because of their beats, some get over with their swagger and charisma, and even a select few get over with superb lyrics, Bun B managed to combine all of those three things into one outstanding album. Is it classic? Difficult to judge at the moment, only being a year old; will it be classic in time? I think I can safely say it will be. This is not only an amazing solo debut for Bun B, but it's also one one of the best UGK releases overall.  Though I love Pimp C, I can't lie when I say Bun B is definitely my favorite of the two; and one of my top five Southern emcees. He is really a perfect rapper in every sense of the word; the wordplay, the flow, the diction, the presence, the ear for beats. Hell, Bun B even gets considerably deeper than most of his Southern contemporaries, and is most definitely one of the most underrated lyricists in the game.   Tracks like "Get Throwed" and "Draped Up" were classic anthems instantly. However, they're most definitely not the only highlights to be found on this album. "I'm Fresh" has an infectious hook, and beat provided by the man who is fresher than a brazilian banana, Mannie Fresh. "Pushin'" features two of other favorite Southern emcees, Scarface and Jeezy, and is one rap song Rick Ross should've studied while he was preparing his album. "Trill Recognize Trill" with Ludacris is an awesome track, with these two Southern heavyweights going back and forth, and Luda going for a more hardcore route than usual. "Bun" is the first full-length song on the album, and is a great into for this star-studded album. "I'm A G'" with T.I. is another highlight, and these two work well together on any collaboration. "What I Represent(UGK)" and "The Story" also show Bun B isn't afraid to get personal, as he tells the story of UGK's career in the former, and the story of Pimp C's incarceration in the latter. The "Draped Up" remix with all of the H-Town all-stars is also one of the best collaborations I've heard in quite awhile.  In the end, this album is one of the best to come out in a long time, and most definitely one of the best of '05. Bun B is criminally underrated, as he's not just one of the best Southern emcees, but one of the most solid emcees you'll find in any part of the game. Get this album immediately; you won't regret it 
 Warner Bros. has assembled a superb group of films derived from the plays, a novella, and an original screenplay by the immortal Tennessee Williams. Each film has been given a stellar presentation, with the finest of them all, his masterpiece, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, given the Warner 2-Disc special treatment. Filled with documentaries, commentaries, screen tests, and outtakes, this set is really an amazing assemblage of much of Williams' best work. At last we also have a remastered CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, which now looks stunning, following a rather faded and pasty DVD in the early days of the format.  Not content to rest on their laurels as others would, WB has unearthed a relatively unknown motion picture that will be a treasure to those who love this man's work.  A Canadian documentary feature from the mid '70s called "TENNNESSEE WILLIAMS' SOUTH" has been rescued from limbo, and how wonderful to have it included as an exclusive bonus in this collection. Not only does it contain rare interviews with Williams shot over the period of a year in both Key West and New Orleans, but it also contains scenes from his plays performed by some of our greatest actors, including Maureen Stapleton, Burl Ives, and most importantly, Jessica Tandy re-creating her performance as Blanche DuBois. A miracle to behold 
 I think milllion dollar baby was a great movie and good book to read. maggie did a outstanding job, but the book is better to me because it tells you more. mainly it's about how a young lady want to be boxer clint eastwood who playing frankie was the trainer at first he didn't won't to train a girl,but he seen the desir and will power out of her.all she won't is to have a little bit frame in her life. it a great book to read to your kids and family and the movie is good to you got see it and read the book to. 
 This was a great purchase.  It was shipped promptly and I was notified often ater I ordered it and after it was shipped 
 Another hot record from Brian Setzer, a mix of rockabilly, doo-wop & country! His masterpiece. This album is recorded by Brian Setzer Trio (John 'Spaz' Hatton is on bass and of course Bernie Dresel on drums). "Sixty Years" is a bluesy number, "Don't Trust a Woman (In a Black Cadillac)" is a great rocker, "When The Bells Don't Chim" a traditional country, "That Someone Just Ain't You" is a prom-dance ballad, "Rat Pack Boogie" is another Brian Setzer instrumental, "Ring, Ring, Ring" and "Drink Whiskey and Shut Up" and "Smokin' 'n' Burnin'" are beautiful rockabilly numbers, "To Be Loved" is beautiful doo-wop number, "Wild Wind" is Wild West ballad. This is one hell of an album. The bonus disc contains one song only "Luck Be A Lady" by Brian Setzer Orchestra 
 At recent times, lots of book about new public management and reformist movements have been published by varied writers. The most important flaw of the propositions given and models created was the ignorance of the politic realities. And most of the models has been based on pure rational/economic assumptions. Therefore, none of them was completely applicable for public sector organizations. This book gives us some insights about the politic "realities" of the public sector and its relationship to the democratic context of the society. All contradictions the popular public management propositions hold are explained in the book as clearly as possible. The author of the book puts forward arguements contrary to the popular public management propositions. If you are getting bored due to the myriad popular books and models this book exactly is for you to read and gain an interesting and deeper understanding about the essentials of public administration. Strongly recommended 
 A National Book Award finalist, this book is now all too little-known. It's a great story and Jon Agee's illustrations of loving woodchuck newlyweds and loud messy toddler convey humor and tenderness. A winner for kids eight to ten.  carolweston.co 
 Wonderful as content based novel in SS instructio 
 Now a book that shows two sides of slavery that all white people were not all for slavery .Like Dr.martin luther king was saying that slavery was not about black against white ,but justice againt injustice.Because if all men and women are not free then we are all in chains.Books like this one has giving us a balance look at one of america darkest sides. But men like Garrison showed us that their were men and women that were a light of hope that all men are created equal . And  being a black man I must say thank you to all the blackmen and women and white men and women of the past for fighting a fight that many of us still fight for today .And that is for an opportunity to live as we were when God created us in the beginnig as, a human being thank you 
 For a Batman Beyond episode, this was entertaining, action-packed, and it even had a good storyline, good villain (of course) and even a good Batman like the old Batman Animated used be.  the new Batman, Terry McGinnis, was far better in this movie than he was than when he first donned the Mask.  He used his BRAINS, his skills and his Bat-like reflexes which made you believe he was the rightful replacement for Bruce Wayne's Batman.  Sure, he's no Dick Grayson, what Dick might have been as "Batman", or even Tim Drake....but this movie made it convincing that McGinnis wasn't a bad Batman.  However, a few complaints:  Kind of a convenient way of getting rid of an unpopular Robin.  I mean, doesn't Bruce Wayne always put tracking devices on EVERYTHING and EVERYONE? the original Batman was kinda old, slow and stupid in this one.  HE should have thought out WHERE Robin was held captive the entire time.  HE would have figured it out in the old animated series!  And, McGinnis knocking over that huge lava lamp, without the Bat Suit? That smacks of Indiana Jones or the old Batman.  No way is that possible.  And, if someone did that to me, I would be running for my life, not still going after him!!  However, the match up between the new Bat"fake" as Joker calls him, and the Joker is superbly well done, believable and amazing.  It was nice to see Mark Hamil go at it one more time as the Joker.  There will be no other Joker in my mind. It was also good to see some "uncut" violence that you know the JOKER would do! It's too bad McGinnis' villains don't make him into anything but a guy in a suit, because the Joker placed him on a higher pedestal; as he did with the original Batman.  If the producers and directors of Batman Beyond had been able to write better villains for McGinnis, the new series would have been able to endure for a bit longer.  All the good episodes of BB always crisscross with Bruce Wayne's old enemies.  Blight, or Derek Powers, one of the few interesting McGinnis villains should've been fleshed out more.  All and all, though, this movie was one of the better Batman movies since Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.  I wish they would continue Batman Beyond, they cancelled it just when it was getting better.  Perhaps they can make a NightWing series, that would be interesting in itself.  yeah, yeah, I know, I spend too much time watching "kids" shows.  But, hey, you gotta do something when you're not writing ! 
 Hansel and Gretel is my fav fairy tales. Almost all stories of Grimm have moral values and this one is no exception. Fairy tales were told as form of entertainment too. They show the kids the right way to behave. However, If pondered over, Hansel and Gretel is one fairy tale with Biblical resemblance. The kids view their parents house as a place of security.The two children are wandering through the woods and are hungry, tired and alone.  This closely resembles the passage where Jesus wandered through the desert for forty days.  He too was tired and hungry and completely alone.  During this time, Satan tried to tempt Jesus with food.  Satan told Him that if He were the Son of God, then He should turn a stone into bread for food (Luke 4:3).  Jesus did not get tempted but here in the story, the children saw the gingerbread house and ate parts of it until they were full. The children continued to eat pieces of it even after they were full, which is gluttony. And Gluttony is one topic in Bible is seen as one of the seven deadly sins, if I am not mistaken. Than the final part, Gretel traps the witch inside her own oven, right before she was getting ready to cook Hansel.  The witch is burnt up.  This resembles the story of Satan.  At the end of Satan's reign over earth, the Christians will be saved from the fire and Satan will be thrown into the fiery pit of Hell, where he will be tortured forever. In end, there is rejoicing; very similiar when the satan (witch) dies,the children reap the rewards and rejoice to 'live happily ever after' Moreover, the tale show abandonment, hunger, fear,friendly sibling example, family unity - issues that startles kids minds to pause and think. It makes the kids dive into imagination and with the very good illustrations and very well re-told classic, this book is a wonderful Pick for all Children - Best of the Best Fairy tale to read and instil moral values in kids 
 This is a very interesting book because show us of the simplified way how is possible to learn about lean manufacturing . It's important to highlighting that language of this book is very simple and your reading bring us a lot of pleasure  
 If you're looking for something fast paced, this book probably isn't for you. There are elements of suspense and action, but not a lot. That's not its purpose.  However, if you're looking for something that lets you know, "If he can make it, I can make it", then this is a must read. A strong spiritual thread is interwoven in the life of a man, who like Job, keeps comin' up against it.  There are finely drawn characters who I would like to meet, and a setting that feels grand and raw at the same time.  I'm proud to add it to my collection 
 I got the item fast and in great condition, just as I expected 
 This is the first of a trilogy of films written and directed by Deepa Mehta.EARTH is the film that sets up the following films by telling us the history of the breakup of India from British rule.For 250 years Hindus,Muslims,Sikhs and Parcees had all coexisted under British Colonial rule.Now,in 1947 Britain,as it is pulling out,divides the land into India and Pakistan.The best of friends and families are forced to choose where they will go and where their loyalties will be.Nine year old Lenny-baby.a lame girl from the neutral Parcees,witnesses this calamity as the story is told from her innocent viewpoint.EARTH sets up the conditions that existed in India at the time to prepare you for the following FIRE and WATER.EARTH is an excellent companion movie to GANDHIand A PASSAGE TO INDIA as it sets all of the historical facts into place,yet telling the story with great pathos.EARTH is the most action oriented of the Deepa Mehta trilogy.FIRE and WATER are much more introspective and reflective.THIS IS A TREMENDOUS THREESOME OF FILMS THAT ARE ALL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
 An enjoyable quick read that brought back memories of a very entertaining talent rich team.  At that time the Mets were available in Massachusetts on cable and I watched a lot of their games both because the National League is a better brand of ball and Tim McCarver a top notch analyst.  The local Red Sox are something that I try and ignore.  Thus the final match-up was a no way can the Mets lose thought.  Of course without the interesting umpire calls Houston would have beaten the Mets.  Mayber that is a subject for a book as there have been numerous out and out bad calls in all sports.  The sadness of exceptional squandered talent, i.e. Gooden and Strawberry along with the inside perspective on the players with their warts keeps the book both informative and entertaining 
 This is an intelligent sci-fi thriller that doesn't disappoint.  It's a bleak and distubing look at the world, two decades from now.  Chaos has erupted everywhere as people are overcome by an overwhelming hopelessness.  This fear is generated due to the fact that no child has been born for eighteen years.  It's a countdown to extinction. Theo(Clive Owen) is asked to deliver a young pregnant girl out of the tumultuous country.  To the casual viewer this may not seem like much of a task, unless you can really submerse yourself in the context of the volatile situation.  I totally got caught up in the effort, completely absorbed by the significance of this mission.  The action really kept me on edge. I was expecting the movie to get too preachy with apocalyptic themes, you know--hell, fire and brimstone.  Any religous fanatics would definitely have some valid points.  This is touched on periodically, but doesn't go too over the top.  I also liked the sarcasm evident when some idiot spray painted a sign that read "Last one to die, please turn out the lights".  There's always gotta be a prankster. Overall, I thought this was a great movie--action-packed, original, and insightful 
 I've heard about this book for several years and it is truly a must read, everything I was led to anticipate.  It is loaded with facts and experiential info.  It's also fun to read.  Don't be intimidated by how much info there is.  Just use it and keep going back into it as you get more familiar with Michael's approach.  I teach at The Meeting School, a little Quaker farm school in southern NH.  I'm definitely using this book with my students from here on in.  Happy orcharding 
 I have been working on java development projects for many years as a project manager.  I came up through the business side and over the years, techies I have worked with have taught me quite a bit about software development.  Anil recently came and made a presentation at the company I work at and I was very impressed.  He outlined a development approach using Agile processes and as part of the developers toolkit, he spoke about Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse.  I have experience with Agile, but the techie tools were new to me, so, I picked up a copy of Anil's book for a deeper explanation.   The book does a really nice job of explaining how to use Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse with the agile development process.  The Agile information was short and concise and framing it around the development of a real application was helpful.  There were a lot of code examples about how to use the tech tools - some of the examples I could follow - others I could not.  However, the benefit from reading the book was that I can now follow my developers discussions when they talk about Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse.  While I couldn't write the code, I can at least participate 
 I just finished reading this and I want to convey how impressed I am with this author. Not only does he talk about straight edge from a personal/biographical viewpoint, he incorporates direct quotes from other individuals in the scene, especially the Denver sXe scene, into his very well organized book. Moreover, he doesn't just leave his findings un-analyzed. Haenfler looks at the inherent contradictions in straight edge in light of gender roles, militant vs. positive straight edgers, and more. He really looks at straight edge in relation to what other ethographers and sociologists have said about subcultures and other non-mainstream movements, including punk, teeny-boppers, and skin heads, to name a few of the comparisons. As I said in the title of this review, this is truly an intelligent and complete ethnography; Haenfler looks at straight edge from so many social and cultural angles, really getting to the core of the movement, while still exploring the implications of the widespread variation amongst straight edgers. I'm really hoping to be able to use this book for a writing seminar I'm in at the moment...how cool would that be?  On a more personal note, this book solidified my pledge to being straight edge and really made me feel proud of that decision. Haenfler mostly discusses straight edgers in the hardcore music scenes in Denver, NY, and Boston, but I've never been a member of any real straight edge "scene." It's got to be easier for straight edge kids who have a support group to keep them on track, but I've never really had that. Reading this book made me realize that I've come to the same sort of progressive conclusions about life, society, and politics that other scene-straight edgers have, but all on my own. So in that sense, this book really connected me to the global straight edge movement.  Haenfler also provides a good historical analysis of straight edge as well by discussing in relative detail the music that was and is so essential to the scene. He gives a well-balanced and well-intermingled look at straight edge hardcore music as well as the other social implications of straight edge. He clearly knows a lot about the music too.  Thanks to Ross Haenfler for writing this book. Seriously, it is so frickin good. And it made me feel so good about the world. Sweet deal 
 I used this book in its 4th edition as an undergraduate and I am very glad I kept it, because I used it extensively in my graduate theory class last semester.  Ritzer makes it easy to understand and appreciate the classical theorists and I would highly recommend it as a good general book for students 
 James "Nick" Rowe personifies what being an American is all about.  He chose to serve in the Army and answered the call to serve in Viet Nam.  For five years he endured unbelievable hardships but his parents and West Point instilled in him the courage and determination to never give up.  His story is one that should be a reading requirement for all Americans so that they might uderstand how much they owe to those who serve.  His book is simply stated but so eloquently meaningful.  At the end I shed happy tears 
 I at first got the more current version (not the one I needed), but with a couple of emails and return of the first item I received the correct version very quickly!! I really appreciate the effort and caring service! 
 The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.  It's great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper 
 Twenty-seven-year-old Echo Brennan feels as if the life she's dreamed of since she was in her teens is slowly slipping away, as her life is stuck on pause. For instance, instead of chasing the job of her dreams at DISC Magazine, Echo is stuck writing for the small-time Brooklyn Art & Times (aka the BAT) Newspaper, where she spends her days listening to indie albums, searching for an up-and-comer who can truly take the world by storm; and her nights helping her struggling musician boyfriend, Matt, overcome his four-year long writer's block. Matt Hanley was once the hottest newcomer on the scene, but since he began dating Echo, the most he can do is compose music. Now, with a record deal hanging over his head, Matt knows that he needs to produce something ASAP to please the head honchos at the label, and make his name chart-worthy once more. But things just aren't working out as he planned. Which is why Echo kicks him out, and decides that it's time to put herself first for once, and work on finding some personal success, as well as a boyfriend who brings some stability to the table. However, once Echo and Matt split, Matt suddenly finds exactly what he was looking for all these years: a muse. Echo's quick turnaround feelings about him have left him broken-hearted, so he does something unforgivable...he writes a collection of songs claiming what a horrible, unsupportive girlfriend Echo was - using her name in each and every one of them, and making her the most hated woman in rock and roll. Now, Echo's life is being showcased for the world to see. Suddenly, guys are scared of her, and she can't find a job anywhere. As if that weren't bad enough, Matt's music begins making her question exactly how supportive of his career she truly was; and rethink how she's going to survive in this Echo-hating world. After all, when your reputation in New York becomes tarnished, the only thing you can do is create a new one.  As a music lover and writer, as well as a chick lit fan, I was absolutely ecstatic to stumble upon Melanie Murray's GOOD TIMES, BAD BOYS, which took the best of both worlds, and blended lyrics together with shopping, partying, and New York nightlife, to create a refreshing new addition to the world of chick lit. Echo is a hilarious character, whose mixed feelings for Matt and his music is relatable, while her complaints regarding her big hips, and penchant for over-eating anything sweet is hilarious. The secondary characters, from Matt himself, to Echo's glamorous older sister Thalia, and her Park Avenue Princess best friend, Alicia, bring their own dimensions to the hard rock fairytale, and offer a nice contrasting bit of dialogue. Murray has proven that she has quite an ear for music, and knows her oldies rock and roll quite well. Her descriptions of writing for a magazine, the inner-workings of a record studio, and the nervousness some musicians experience before a show are not only in-depth, but prefer a nice backdrop to the various situations Echo is forced to suffer through on an almost daily basis. GOOD TIMES, BAD BOYS will rock your world!  Erika Sorocc 
 This was absolutely a brutal read; however, it was more or less a paradox described as painfully interesting. The mind of Adam Smith is incredible, and I encourage an interested reader to duke it out as you'll most certainly come out of the book more informed. I would recommend Wealth of Nations to anyone who has a mild interest in Economics.  Brian Ole 
 I disagree with a previous reviewer's comment about Sara. I identified with Sara so strongly that I was driven to email the author herself (who was very gracious, but that's not relevant here). I think it was wonderful that Sara was indeed a very bright academic but also was a vulnerable romantic who hadn't yet quite found the strength to define herself. So she did what a lot of women do in their early twenties--she defined herself in relation to her relationship with a man. Commendable? No.  Understandable? Absolutely. Stay with her, though. She comes into her own.  It's a wonderful book that made me laugh out loud. You have to read the bit about allowing pre-consumptives shape your attitudes about love. It's hysterical. It's honest and vulnerable and funny and sad and for me, very real.  What more could you want 
 I like the book layout and content.  I learned a lot from it, knowledge as well as wisdom on investing.  I definetely recommend this book 
 This a well written book, easy to ready and contains wealth of information for any Linux enthusiast or on IT professional.  Whether you're studying for your Linux certification, learning Linux administration from scratch, or just need a solid companion in the world of Linux administration - this book is a must have!  It's a 4edition and it must tell you something, at least.   What makes this book a steal is the variety of information presented.  Don't be alarmed by its 600 pages.  Every bit of it is important.  As in many Linux books though, some topics are so complex they require additional information, especially if you need more in depth knowledge.  However, whether it's Samba, LDAP, FTP, Apache, Kernel compilation - the information is presented in a very well organized manner.   You must note though, this is a Beginner's Guide.  If you are a seasoned Linux admin, this book is probably not for you.   5 stars 
 An essential book for any instructional designer's library- especially for beginner designer 
 After having my son five months ago, i never worked out again.  While pregnant i workout all the time.  It has been hard to find time to workout or when i start 10-20 minutes later i have to stop. I bought this tape and have been thrilled with it.  I can workout for 10 minutes at a time while my son is entertained or napping.  i highly recommend this video for a mom that needs to get back into shape 
 Who doesnt love the Wind in the Willows? great book for children, I love it even now as a college student. I brought it with me and keep it on my bookshelf in my dorm room. The sweet little mole, the wise old badger, and of course, the silly and carefree toad-what charming characters! everyone must read this book at some point over the course of their lifetime, and will most likely chose to read it again soon after. 
 As a Lost in Space fan since I was a youngster, I have enjoyed watching the episodes over and over again. There are part of my teenager years. 
 The ideas John Holt gives in this book How Children Fail are somehow true. A lot of his points are true but not all of them . This book is a great book for ideas and advice. John Holt's book should be recommended not only for students but for people of all different ages.It is a great lesson for  students  to learn how to behave in school and for teachers how to communicate with their students; it's also helpful for parents with relationships with their children. You will really enjoy spending time reading this book 
 Shelby Foote is obviously a well known Civil War Historian, but the story told by C. Stuart Chapman makes Shelby Foote's legacy everlasting 
 Thorough coverage of accounting and financial management topics make this a must-have resource for business students! You will find it valuable for reading up on areas that may not be covered well in your course's textbook. The clear, concise style of Corporate Controller's Handbook makes reading the book a pleasure; I recommend it without reservation 
 This is a most relevant book. It is the story of two cousins who consistently and relentlessly clashed over just what kind of nation the United States would become.  Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall were political polar opposites. Jefferson, the Republican, was a fervent believer in State's rights. He held forth strongly that unguarded concentrations of power within the Federal Government would ultimately lead to the destruction of the United States. He was right.  John Marshall's views were just the opposite. Marshall subscribed to a strong central government. He passionately believed that left to themselves, each State's regional self interest would lead to the destruction of the United States. He was also right.  Therein lays the conundrum that faced the early republic and led to the formation of the first political parties. Both sides were right and both sides were wrong. Both men lived to see their fears of unchecked concentrations of power in the Federal Government or in the States lead to exactly the assaults on liberty that each feared. But in a larger sense both men, probably without realizing it, truly lived the concept of checks and balances both subscribed to and cherished within the Constitution.  This is an amazing story of continual, unrequited confrontation. Make no mistake; these men did not like each other. Each defined the other as what was wrong with the early republic. Ultimately, John Marshall prevails in his bid to establish the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of the Constitution and the authoritative voice for the constitutional supremacy of the federal government over the states. More than 150 years after Jefferson's and Marshall's deaths, their words and achievements still reverberate in today's constitutional debate and political party battles. You will be fascinated by this work. Theirs was a confrontation that continues to define just what kind of nation the United States should be. 
 As guidebooks to Hawaii go, the Rough Guide is a reasonably comprehensive resource with solid, middle-of-the-road information about all the islands. The challenge in covering the whole state within a single tome is that author Greg Ward has to pitch his research at a necessary cursory level and spends approximately 60-70 pages on each island. Consequently, if you choose to focus on one or two islands, as most travelers do, the book ends up being somewhat lacking on the details that really can separate a good vacation from a great one.  Beyond the color maps in the middle, the book is all text, so it does require concentration to absorb much of the information presented. However, Ward provides helpful information on preparing for your trip, choosing accommodations and eateries, and exploring the more popular attractions. What's missing is the off-the-beaten path insight that, for example, Andrew Doughty provides in spades in his book, "Maui Revealed". The other gap is a vivid perspective on what the must-do activities are. Consequently, this is not an all-encompassing resource but one that needs to be complemented by other books that specialize on the islands you visit or the personal research you need to conduct on your own. Regardless, it's still a solid resource 
 Excellent and easy to use. A must for people who feel that the body has the power to heal itself from inside and are tied of the medical professions inadequacies 
 Cynthia Rylant is a fantastic author who writes wholesome books that boost confidence, self-esteem, respect, responsibility, friendship, support, and basically the "Golden Rule" of love one another and treat others as you want to be treated, which is how each and every one of us should live.  Her cobblestreet cousins' books are lovely interactions between cousins with family support, the importance of marriage commitment, and respect.  
 As the reviewer below mentions, this is a collection of articles that Kloppenberg has published at different times over the years. I agree with the reviewer below that there is some overlap between the articles. In fact, the whole argument would have been greatly strengthened by just rewriting the articles as a new book. Kvetch, kvetch, kvetch. Yes, it could be better but what we have here is one of the strongest combinations of historiography and actual history possible. There are so many virtues to this book that to complain that it could be better would be downright inane of me. Kloppenberg is exploring several themes in the course of these articles. The first is that the past is messier than it is usually presented as being. There is a tendency in much historical writing to want to simplify that messiness in order to argue a particular point. Thus the whole republicanism-liberalism debate. Kloppenberg wants us to accept that our founders drew from multiple traditions including Protestantism, republicanism, an early liberalism restraint by natural law and the Scottish Enlightenment. They themselves saw these traditions as largely compatible. They were not interested in intellectual consistency as much as working through the issues of the times within the institutions they were trying to create. They tried to balance competing values and interests. Gosh, just like we do. His second major theme is the centrality of religion to all American thought but especially to our political thought. "The language of religion...was pivotal in enlisting the allegiance of eighteenth-century Americans to the republican cause. Thomas Paine was an American hero when he sprinkled Common Sense with biblical allusions...he became a pariah when he attacked Christianity in The Age of Reason" (p.62). Christianity later sustained the abolitionists, the woman's movement, the Knights of Labor and the progressives.  Kloppenberg wants to claim that perhaps the major reason liberalism seems to no longer speak the majority of Americans is that it has become aggressively secular. Finally, Kloppenberg wants to assert the centrality of pragmatism to both historiography and political and cultural practice. In fact, pragmatism becomes the method by which we balance competing claims of all kinds. The pragmatic method is presented as being an ongoing balancing act between competing values, between knowledge and faith, between the rights of the individual and the responsibility of the individual to their community. I want to emphasize a couple of points that Kloppenberg makes here. He quotes the following from Walter Lippman's Drift and Mastery:   "Everyone is compelled to omit infinitely more than he can deal with; everyone is compelled to meet the fact that a democratic vision must be made by the progressive collaboration of many people" (p. 130). This is a difficult but important point and gets to one of the paradoxes of Kloppenberg's approach. The idea is that politics is never-ending and is constantly being revised. Everything is open to question by the democratic community. This is where my review title comes from. The location of our responsibility is in submitting honestly to this type of political practice as constant critique (p.89). Not only is our knowledge provisional but it must also be seen as contextual, i.e., as the product of a particular time and place. All of our cultural values are as well. Our rights such as free speech or "the duty of mutual respect" are the result of centuries of hard and sometimes bloody "cultural labor"(p.159). I mention that particular duty because I am often dismayed by the tone of reviews of political books on Amazon. Mutual respect may be a value we are losing and we are the smaller for it. I greatly admire Kloppenberg's learning and approach to these issues. I think he is absolutely on the right track. My major issue with his approach has to do with the dialogue between fundamentalists (of all kinds- scientism, religious, political) and those (like myself) who see tolerance as being a sine qua non for democracy. I recognize that tolerance for a fundamentalist is a very questionable value. If you really believe you know the truth why would you tolerate falsity? This seems to me to be the major challenge facing any form of deliberative democracy- how do you get everyone to agree to play by the rules? I would like to make one last compliment to Kloppenberg. This is an incredibly learned man. He seems to have absorbed so much of not just our cultural tradition but that of France, England and Germany's that it is a little bit scary. If you are curious to see more of his methodology at work or some of that learning on display take a look at his Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought. It is one of the great works in intellectual history in the last twenty years. 
 The first couple in the series were hard to read.  She writes very formally.  British style.  But I must admit, the characters are addicting!  I can't wait to read the next one 
 Set in the world of championship dog shows and cast with kooky characters who strive to have their pooch named top dog, BEST IN SHOW is a hilariously funny film that will easily have you laughing out loud.  Though there is a scripted premise, most of the dialog in BEST IN SHOW is ad-libbed by comedic greats that include Christopher Guest, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Ed Begley, Jr. to name just a few.  The gist of BEST IN SHOW is simple: five dogs whose owners have virtually nothing in common with each other, travel to Philadelphia to enter the Mayflower, a prestigious championship dog show, loosely based on the Westminster event.    Beatrice, the emotionless Weimaraner is shown by an uptight yuppie couple (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey) who are nervous wrecks, read the J. Crew catalog like it is a work of great literature and constantly bicker with each other about their dog's mental health and the subtle differences the colors putty and ecru.  Rhapsody in White, the highly coiffed Standard Poodle is owned by a 90 year old kajillionaire's trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) who is having an affair with Christy Cummings, the dog's severe lesbian trainer (Jane Lynch).  Winky, a spunky Norwich Terrier is adored by a former party girl (Catherine O'Hara) and her nerdy, two left footed husband (Eugene Levy) who at every turn is forced to confront his wife's promiscuous past and her sloppy bookkeeping skills.  Miss Agnes, the fluffy white Shih Tzu is the prized pooch of two gay men, played brilliantly by Michael McKean and his campy live-in boyfriend (John Michael Higgins).  Hubert, the sad-eyed Bloodhound is shown by a single country boy, played by Christopher Guest, who created the series of mock documentary films that BEST IN SHOW is one part of.  There are far too many hilarious scenes in BEST IN SHOW to recount.  Particularly great ones include the scene when Winky's owner and her husband check into their hotel and are offered a room in the storage closet by a stiff inn keeper who you may or may not recognize as Ed Begley, Jr.  Another great scene is when a very inappropriate color commentator (Fred Willard) reels off one bizarre observation after another about the dog's trainers, the judges and the clothing of its owners.  But perhaps my favorite scene is when Winky's owners visit an old friend who works as a hostage negotiator and announces almost demonically that when people are on top of a building and threaten to leap to their deaths, "they all jump."  BEST IN SHOW is a highly recommended DVD from the same mock documentary genre of This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman.  With star performances by some of the most talented comedians of our time, this movie will have you laughing out loud from start to finish 
 WE ARE ENJOYING THE MOVIE.  WE COULD NOT FIND THIS MOVIE IN OUR CITY, SO GLAD YOU HAD IT ON LINE.  THIS IS A COMEDY WESTERN AND VERY FUNNY.  WE GET MANY GOOD LAUGHS WHILE WATCHING IT.    
 How would you feel if you had to go on two manhunts, two years in a row, while knowing there is a slim chance of catching the men? In 1999 there was a huge manhunt in the canyons of the Four Corners, which are in the southwest of the United States. They never did catch the two men. Now here they are one year later doing the same thing. 	Jim Chee is a man of the law, and he worked on the first manhunt in '99 and tries to stay hidden from his boss so he doesn't have to go on this manhunt. When the FBI gets in on the hunt he definitely doesn't want to go to work, because they get all the nice stuff and headlines in the news. Ex-cop Joe Leaphorn sticks his nose where it doesn't belong and comes up big for the case. Leaphorn was Chee's old boss and a good one at that.  	I really liked this book. If you like mysteries and suspense then this is a good book for you. This is also a very good book for young-adults and older. I would strongly recommend this book for readers who like an easy to read mystery.  -Ada 
 one of my three favorite byrds albums (the other two being "mr tambourine man" and "the notorious byrd brothers"), this is like a crossroads for all the byrds leanings in sound. the 12-string guitar is still present, the heavy psychedelia is in full bloom, and there are touches of country shadings. all in all, though, this is their most hippy oriented outting (the notorious byrd brothers album does give it a run for its money), with all the psychedelic trappings present, including reversed tapes and all that jazz. the songs are top notch, and the whole recording has a fresh playful quality that time has not diminished. this album is a must for all fans of 60's music, and highly recommended to all lovers of pop/folk/rock in general. the remasterd version is highly preferrable in sound to the first cd version, so buyer beware. the six bonus cuts could well have been left off. they add nothing to impact of the original 11 cuts 
 This book offers persuasive arguments for increasing mathematical literacy, as if we needed much convincing. His case is presented by way of a varied set of examples that drive the point home... eventually. This is because it often feels as if the author is showing off how clever he can be, and the text tends to wander off a bit too self-referentially into the esoterics of the example at hand.  For a more focused version of his ideas, I urge you to read another one of his books: "A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper" 
 As an elementary teacher and a parent, I've developed a collection of party planning books for kid's parties.  This is the book I return to again and again for the best suggestions.  There are so many creative ideas for decorations, menus, games and party favors.  Some of my favorites include the Rainbow party (a big hit for toddlers!), the Firefighter party (including fun games involving squirting targets with a garden hose), and the Space party (where the favor bags are black bags poked with constellation holes and a flashlight!) 
 The collaborative effort of writer and British country estates expert Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd and architectural photographer Christopher Simon Sykes, Manor Houses Of England is a stunningly visual and informatively descriptive showcase of great and historic works of British country manor house architecture. Manor Houses Of England is illustrated throughout with full-color photographs on almost every two-page spread and filled from cover to cover with fascinating and descriptive information and insights about the history, construction, use, and present-day status of each these majestic buildings depicted. Very highly recommended for armchair travelers and architecture buffs, Manor Houses Of England is the next best thing to taking a personally guided, on-site tour of these awe-inspiring buildings 
 AGALLOCH - Pale Folklore - It seldom in modern metal that a band's debut is this cohesive...  Everything on this Album is so well written and carefully calculated.  From the opener, `She Painted Fire Across the Skyline' (Which is broken into 3 tracks.) any doubts one might have are easily washed away by Lush soundscapes of Folk, Prog, and Black Metal.  Within Part I of the song you hear haunting female operatic vocals, (mixed with the vocalist black-metal whispers) Timpani drums, the blowing of the wind, and a variety of other unique sounds.  Agalloch seem to be able to create an `aura' which seems almost unrivalled in today's Metal Scene.  - Now, I've read some Opeth comparisons... I don't really think they sound a lot alike (maybe some hints of the Orchid or Morningrise days) but I can agree with the fact they are both Artists in their crafts... Each band has clearly outlined an artistic vision and carved their own niche in Metal, not just rehashed another bands sound.   Truth is I've only listened to this album 3 times since I got it yesterday... and I know I've only just heard begun to scratch the surface.  Even after only 3 spins I'm confident enough to give this album 5 Stars.  This is best listened from start to finish...  I love when a band makes an `Album' not just a bunch `songs' thrown randomly together.  Honestly I'm dumbfounded that I'm just hearing about these guys now... I also have `The Mantle' but I figure I'll give this one a few mores spins before I take on that Journey. Honestly this band could appeal to anyone who likes Opeth, Amorphis, or any other band that has incorporated Folk and Progression into Metal.  Or just about anyone who appreciates true Artistic talent.  In fact, I thinks fans of bands like Pelican, Isis or Neurosis would probably enjoy them for their atmospheric elements alone. (though sounding completely different)   Shockingly these guys are also American (Portland OR.)  Which just goes to show not everyone there is humping the mainstream MTV band wagon.   Forget listening to the samples... Just buy this album, press play and sit back and transcend into an musical journey.   Favorite Tracks:  She Painted Fire Across the Skyline, (Parts 1, 2 and 3.) and As Embers Dress the Sky. -5 Stars 
 Plainly put, this book was a ride. Standing back from a distance and looking at what the author has done really can put you in awe - the sheer scope of this work is breathtaking. He digs into many different scientific, mathematical, and artistic disciplines, and somehow manages to work them all together into a sometimes confusing, but ultimately satisfying whole.  The short dialogues that fit in between each chapter are clever and always thought-provoking, but the bulk of this book's worth comes in the chapters. From the beginning to the end, I constantly found myself having to stop and rethink my perspective on many subjects. As the end of the book nears, he wraps it up by theorizing profoundly on the then-blooming subject of artificial intelligence. While parts of this are dated by this point, much of it isn't, and that is a testament to Hofstadter's powerful intellect and foresight.  As you may have guessed from my review's title, this is not a summer beach read. Admittedly I am not the world's fastest reader, but this one took me a few months to complete (I would often put it down for a stretch and pick it up again some time later). So take your time with this one - enjoy it, reread passages you didn't understand the first time, and maybe pick up a different, easier book when you feel bogged down. But for anyone with any interest in mathematics, computer science, or the philosophy of the human mind, this is a must-have and well worth all the time you can give it 
 Richard Byers was tapped for this Realms Shaking Event (RSE) trilogy. For those of you who don't know a RSE is an event told in a book or series of books that will change the Forgotten Realms for ever. Wizards of the Coast doesn't usually tell the reader's when a RSE is occuring it keeps things 'interesting'.  This trilogy of books has a very interesting premise in that the most powerful mortal creatures in the Realms, Dragons, can't control this rage that happens and they don't know when it's coming.  This is definitally and action packed book, and most likely trilogy. Byers does a very good job of helping the reader get inside the various dragon's heads and know what it 'feels' like to experience the rage. He moves between scenes effectively and with little thought of "What just happened."  However, I have one complaint with this trilogy thus far. I would have liked more information on the various types of Dragons that seem to be appearing aside from the traditional dragons. It seems like every 20-30 pages a new type of dragon emerges that I have never heard of. I am not a gamer I only read the novels set in the realms and have no idea what some of these dragons are.  Other than that this is a very well written book and sure to be an interesting trilogy 
 An old movie, but a good movie.  The end is a sad comment on the society of tomorrow.  Heston and Robertson do a great job of acting.  The pace is a little slower than current special effects of today's movies.  If you are not a fast paced dude and can slow down, then I would recommend this one for you 
 I am always in search of something good to read. This book turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  It was a real page turner. Not only that it was the first in a series! Kinsey is a believable character. From her jogging to her bolied egg sandwiches with mayo. I liked her. 
 This book is most excellent.  The principles that Scot Anderson shares in this book are so profound and has impacted and motivated me even more to be all the the Lord wants us to be.  Blessed to be a blessing and willing to pay the price for God's prize.  This will change your life and we're blessed to eat from the fruit of Scot's labor.  If your looking for God's idea for your finances and want to be stirred up in Christ while getting wisdom and understanding of how billionaires think, make that invest and purchase this NOW!  If you really think about it, when we read about Solomon's proverbs, the same principles he used is what people with financial freedom have tapped into.  We as God's people have to get wisdom in all areas of life, take possession of God's promises while applying his principles so we can bring the good news to the end of the earth.  And it takes finances.  Be blessed and get this book today!   
 It's helpful for M.E. for plastic parts design. So many informations to help engineers how to design plastic parts and how to asembly it 
 In June I saw a charming group of roses all begin  to droop I pepped them up with chicken soup! Sprinkle once sprinkle twice sprinkle chicken soup with rice  This is a great book to teach children the months of the year. The repetition of the phrases and the funny little stories with accompanying pictures make for an ideal bedtime read. This isn't nearly as good as some of Sendak's other books (like Where the Wild Things are or Pierre: The Boy Who Didn't Care), but it still carries his unique brand of charm.  
 This is a perfectly executed novel.  Not a word can be cut out or changed without ruining the story.  How writing used to be....  No, even in Waugh's day, this book stood out (I think) for being mannered yet anti-frilly.  Amazingly current and timeless.  Universal, eternal themes treated include the mixing and degeneration of cultures and civilizations, class consciousness, imperialism.  I'm glad it hasn't made into a movie (at least I don't think it has been).  
 This valuable resource provides direct service approaches for job development and placement supports.  It will be useful for staff training and self-empowerment for those with high functioning autism 
 A person can learn almost everything there is to know about this, the one alcoholic drink banned near universally across the western world. Once the celebrated drink of choice among 19th-century bohemians and Impressionist painters, this wormwood-based liqueur left a trail of madness and degeneration in its wake that eventually prompted its illegalization. As discussed by Conrad, the effects of absinthe are highly similar to those of such psychotropes as hashish and opium, and even psilocybin, and are not entirely like that of other types of alcohol. In this book the popular lore (and allure) of this most storied and dangerous drink are covered, along with the secrets of its creation, its history, and reports on the famous and doomed who were users of "the green genie." It all makes for a morbid, tempting, fascinating story, as well as a cautionary tale 
 The Breakbeat Science Exercise series of releases have all been top-notch material. The latest one, Volume 5, mixed by Clever is no exception. This one is further into the leftfield area then previous volumes, but don't let that scare you off.   If anything Clever's track selection is a breath of fresh air in the world of jump-up/clownstep drum & bass music wich mostly all sounds the same.   There is a nice variety of tracks on here including a few from Clever's own Offshore label. Favorites of mine include The Tubes by Mav & Twister, Deep Blue's Do You Voodoo( remixed by Ror-Shak ), Oshima by Klute, Hi-Fi by Resound.....  really the whole disc is quite solid and for such a low price you really can't go wrong!   ... If you like this mix and are ready to swim deeper into the leftfield waters check out Clever's Troubled Waters mix on his own label, Offshore.   
 Kitty Locker's latest edition of Business and Administrative Communication  includes the writing basics as well excellent information on using  electronic media.  The strongest part of this book? The examples.  They  reliably demonstrate the principles she introduces.  Although expensive, I  believe this book provides excellent value.  I use it in a junior-level  college business communication class 
 If you have read any of Michael Lewis's other books and found them enjoyable (either writing style or topic), you will find this a good read, worthy of your time.  You will learn a little about the atmosphere of Silicon Valley during the height of the bubble / late 90s as well as about a very unique figure who helped (over exagerated, per Economist) start it all.  
 There are a few of the things I think are great about Sue Miller's writing:  1) She treats all her characters with compassion and respect - her characters are not diaphanous or caricatures and she doesn't make a point of letting you know which ones you should and shouldn't like... they are just like "real" people you can actually relate to  2) she is not a fan of sugar-coating  This is an honest, compelling, and hard-hitting novel which doesn't force easy solutions or a happy ending, and I think it's a much stronger and more valid novel than most for it 
 I'm a native of Mississippi who now lives in the Northeast. I wish that I could claim that I selected this novel for our recent book group discussion but I cannot. Why do I wish that I would have selected it? As I told my club, this novel captures the heart of the rural south and the strength of 'real' southern women. It's the perfect picture of small town life with the 'haves' and the 'have nots'. That said...whether you are from the south or not, you can't put down this book about a good ole girl trying to start over again and the elderly, wonderful Miss Claudia who steps in to help her while also having to face up to a dark secret from her own past. I can't say enough good things about this one. Loved it 
 This CD is The best Live Gospel CD on the market, Lisa is to Gospel music what the Roots are to Underground Hip Hop. She brings her own Flava to a industry that is not so much open to a diffrent sound. Thank You Lisa for branching out to give us Gospel fans A soul feel. Lisa is my favorite Gospel artist because she never let's me down. Lisa's soul flava definitely compares with the Great soul artist like Jill Scott, Erykah Badu,Lauryn Hill,Amel Laurrieux and India Irie. 2 Thumbs up for this one, NO Doubt !! 
 Jay Mackintosh is a writer suffering from writer's block for as long as he can remember. Between a rock and a hard place, he is desperate for a way out. A way out of London, a way out of meaningless social activity, a girlfriend who doesn't understand, a life disconnected from anything with any true value and ostensibly heading nowhere.  And he finds his way out. Knowing Joanne Harris, where else would that happen but in a remote, isolated village somewhere in the French countryside, a place suspended between past and present, a place that will allow him to rediscover the magic he thought long lost.  Joanne Harris' writing is magical in its own right, and if you are already a fan, this book is one of her best. If you're not, this book will be sure to make you one 
 Lotsa of projects to help in understanding Win32. I compiled projects with VS 2005 and plan to try  others. Some tutorials like Forger's win32 would  definitly help before you approach this book. 
 As an experienced collector, I added this book to my library out of a desire to see what the latest publication for beginners looked like.  Pretty good, overall, though the jewelry depicted and values were misleading.  Much of the jewelry was mid-range, fairly common stuff with the usual over-inflated book values.    The other flaw was the small typeface.  It seems like the publisher was trying to save on pages and reading the text was tough going for my older eyes.  Still, alot of the basics were covered, the book was visually interesting, and it is certainly worth it for the beginner collector 
 For those who don't know russian the title of this was (Просмотрение K-19 - Review of K-19, thought I'd be funny there) This movie is not so much a combat movie it's a what happened movie. The flagship of the Russian Navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 Captians, yea that kinda don't go over so well. They have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys. It is quite a gripping movie though. This is also one that needs to be bought not just rented 
      Just to clarify a preceding review.  The song Elvis performs, "It's Over," is not the same song that belonged to Roy Orbison.        As far as this collection goes, it's a good 'starter's kit' for the casual Elvis listener.  RCA/BMG was gracious to allow Capital to issue this one, but if you want the best of Elvis' Vegas, get "That's The Way It Is Special Editon", the 3-compact disc issue and "Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite".  After that, get their DVD counterparts 
 George Bernard Shaw enables fantasy, dreams and reality to show the heritage of our strugle from the savana to modern civilization.  He crafts modern relationships using powerful mother, father, daughter, son, the loved and the rebuffed to allow us to reflect on our current state.  This book contains clasic elements of a Don Juan dream, a "road trip" and an entire handbook written by one of Mr. Shaws main characters.  The Don Juan dream is one in which the battle of the sexes is answered and shown to be a facade for an agenda that we perpetuate, but do not control or often acknowledge.  The "road trip" appears to be the original of much of what we've experienced in Jack Kerouac's writings and see in our modern movies.   The handbook allows Mr. Shaw to express his own ideas as those of his character.  This provides some insulation from any contemporary criticism that may have come his way.  This work, more so than any other, provides a wonderful avenue to Mr. Shaw's personal philosophy that can lend insight to his other works.  It truly can be said that this book "has it all" with something for everyone.  It is truly amazing that this book has remained relatively obscure, however it has remained a strong influence in many modern literature courses and would be an enjoyable addition to most anyone's book collection 
 Received in great condition.  Wonderful book.  Would recommend to as gift or for your own library 
 If you are the kind of moviegoer who likes beautiful films, i.e., wonderful photography, excellent art direction and unforgetable music, don't miss this one. It's one of those movies that leaves you speechless, with tears in your eyes after contemplating such beautiful images. The story is very sad and dramatic and the three main characters led by Mr. Gere are absolutely great. Terrence Malick has made very few movies; yet,only with this unique creation, he may be proclaimed as an exquisite artist. By the way, as far as the music is concerned, don't get wrong: the main haunting theme belongs to Camille Saint-Saëns'"Carnival of the Animals" ("The Aquarium" theme); the rest of the score, as excellent, belongs to the great Ennio Morricone. 
 Very good quality product, small glitch in shiping but every thing else is fin 
 This is a fantastic book that I definitely recommend to every single coach.  The principles that are discussed along with the DVD presentation helped open up my eyes to a whole new world of basketball that I only dreamed of.  I own over a hundred basketball books, mostly X's and O's but this book is by far the best book that I have in my collection 
 The Catholic Youth Bible is a tremendous resource for anyone who wishes to study the bible.  Catholics, especially, tend not to read it, but to accept interpretations made by their priests.  But I know a group of several non-Catholic ministers & Catholic lay people who read this book every week--admitting that they're not where they should be in their study of this masterpiece.  For that introduction to a life-long study, you can do no better than this beautiful little book.                                        Sincerely, Dr. Frank Brai 
 I'm not sure what the reviewer from "southern california" was smoking when he wrote his review, but he couldn't be more wrong. It's a well-known fact that Martin never (I stress NEVER) got away with changing Buk's writing. The Buk himself said enough in regards to the problems with WOMEN, where Martin did in fact try to spice things up, but Buk caught EVERY SINGLE CHANGE, and demanded they be changed back, thus producing the only Buk/BSP book to be reprinted due to errors. Why then, would anyone think Martin got away with this with Buk's poetry? As far as literary attacks go, Buk fueled these on his own, and was notorious for burning numerous bridges (i.e the Webbs, the aforementioned Wantling, Steve Richmond, Marvin Malone, etc.). A good poem is a good poem regardless of who gets attacked. Most of these people retorted on their own, and understood the nature of the attack. I'm quite suspicious of this reviewer and am positive it is one of those poets who was villified in this collection, namely in the poem: "300 poems." "he was rich and I was poor / and the sea rolled in / and I turned the / white / pages." You know who you are. Regardless of any of that, this is one of Bukowski's finest literary achievements, hail the Buk 
 I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS BOOK AND HAVE HAD ONLY GREAT QUALITY OF ITEMS PURCHASED AND QUICK SHIPPING AND RESPONSE FROM AMAZON.COM THANKS FOR THE EASY WAY TO PURCHASE ITEMS  
 Released in 1949-this movie stars Toshiro Mifune in one of his earliest roles as Tokyo cop Murakami, who's gun is stolen which leads to his relentless drive to recover the weapon-which is being used in a crime spree. We actually see very little of Yusa-the man who winds up with the gun--and I'm not totally convinced that the use of the name was not coincidental considering Japan was occupied by the YU-S-A at the time.  Perhaps Mifunes attempt to retrieve the missing gun and restore his honor is symbolic of Japans attempt to restore it's honor after the War.   Then again-I may be reading into this and it may not be any such thing--however Kurosawa himself-in regard to problems with the American SPCA and this movie stated "I never at any other moment experienced a stronger sense of regret over Japan's losing the war"  Regerdless, as in other films such as "Madadayo" and "Rhapsody in August"-Kurosawa touched on the conflict and the Atomic Bomb-and not implying that he was anti-American--I thnk it's a possibility that Yusa could have had symbolic meaning. That theory aside, this is an excellent movie-which is preserved quite well considering it's age and the conditions when it was filmed--when neither Mifune or Kurosawa were major stars and Japan was still recovering from the war.  While Mifune is my favorite actor--I'm so used to him playing a Samurai--that this role took a little getting used to--but his performance is quite good-as one would expect! Basically, this story revolves around Murakami (Mifune) who is mentored by Sato (Takashi Shimura) and their  pursuit of the missing gun and Yusa (Isao Kimura).  If nothing else-this film is fascinating for it's historical presentation of post war Japan Any Mifune/Kurosawa fans should enjoy this movie!  While quite different-a more recent movie with the same basic premise which is very good is "The Missing Gun 
 Forget about the title of this review - golf is just the backdrop for this hilarious book!  It would have been just as funny on the shuffle board courts of south Florida.  (Hey, there's an idea!)  Try as I might to restrain myself to keep from waking my sleeping kids, I laughed out loud about every five minutes as I read A Nasty Bit of Rough!  The characters were comical, the dialogue was knee-slapping funny and the story moved at a great pace.  My only hope for Christmas this year is that Mr. Feherty isn't done with this oddball crew 
 I really enjoyed this book.  It arrived promptly as promished and was in excellent condition 
 Solid good informative book on more obscure horror films. I watch a lot of horror and out of the 100 mentioned I only saw about 25-30. The rest were obscure yet interesting films worth checking out. I would name them all here but that would take the fun out of reading the book. The book contains more than just the names, it gives descriptions, what sub-genre they're classified in such as ''slasher'', ''supernatural, etc.. it also gives the actors in the film, a brief description of the plot plus cool pictures from the films.    Here's some of the more common ones in the book you might have seen already, especially if you are a big horror/suspense fan. The Changeling Maniac Last House on the Left When A Stranger Calls Pumpkinhead Stir Of Echoes  Exorcist 3  Then some more obscure ones ive never heard of until I read the book such as.. Funny Games- I just purchased this one and all i can say is wow, i wouldve never found this one if it werent this book most likely. ''An Austrian Horror Film'' Cherry Falls- a lower budget film with some of todays young stars Luther the Geek Christmas Evil and tons more  This book covers all kinds of suspense/horror films from all different countries. In this book you will find some foreign gems and underappreciated works. Highly Recommended. Enjoy 
   Anton Lavey has definitely "turned the coin over." It's ironic but I'm a recovering alcoholic (and doing better than ever) and practicing a philosophy that advocates indulgence not abstinance is actually keeping me on the correct path. I live in a transitional living house with roughly 10 other people, and many of them come from the so called best programs in the country armed with thier contrived altruistic ways praising "God" and ultimately fall off the wagon. Meanwhile, I take responsibility for myself by myself. "I am my own redeemer." and staying clean and comfortably so just as I should.   I highly recomend Dr. Lavey's work to anyone searching for an alternative to the coventional religeons of today. If you have the courage, step in and try it out. You might just surprise yourself.        
 This documentary follows Terry Gilliam's failed attempt to make a film based on Cervantes' novel Don Quixote. The film follows the rising wave of disasters that culminate in the canceling of the film only 2 weeks into production.  I think this documentary should be watched by all aspiring filmmakers who can see how bad things can get on a film shoot. There was only one major problem with the film: lack of personal conflict. Everyone who has taken part in a bad shoot knows the amount of back-biting, cover-your-ass, and blame assignment behavior that occurs. Except for a few brief scenes, we don't really see any of this. Whether the cast and crew were on their best behavior while on camera or the documentary filmmakers decided to censor this in editing, these common scenes are noticeably absent.  One interesting opinion I reached while watching the film was that the 1st Assistant Director (1st AD) almost certainly should have been fired. For one, the location scouting was horrendous. Anyone who has ever done location scouting knows that for such a major exterior shot, daily noise pollution and environmental factors should have been checked first hand.   Additionally, when the extras didn't attend their weekend rehearsal (making impossible a shot on the assigned day), the 1st AD had no idea. It strikes the viewer that Terry Gilliam likes the 1st AD and stood by him because the AD was as disorganized as the director. It made me think of the classic line in Spinal Tap: "It's not your job to be as confused as Nigel, is it?"  All in all, an excellent behind the scenes look at an attempt to make a film with a large scope.  Dan Rahmel  Author: "Nuts and Bolts Filmmaking" 
 I love this pasta!  It only takes three minutes to cook and has a great flavor.  I would prefer a 100% whole wheat pasta, but this tastes so good I will continue to purchase this 
 Well I am biased...I love Cheri Huber's books and own a few of them.  The message *is* very simple, and I think the huge contrast in the reviews is interesting.  This might be one of those books that you read a few times (if you give it a second chance) and think it is too simple, kind of lame.  But then one day it just kind of clicks and you see that it is very wise and wodnerful.  Maybe it is that her approach to fear simply doesn't work for everyone.  It, along with some other things in my life,a ll worked together to help me reduce the amount of fear and anxiety in my life, but it isn't a CURE, and requires a lot of MAINTENANCE 
 I have this book and am currently knitting two shawls from the book--Shetland Tea Shawl and Frost Flowers & Leaves.  I am really enjoying knitting lace and have found this particular book to be very inspiring and a big help also.  If you love to knit lace, you must own this book! 
 Ms Davidson thank you for keeping me up till late hours of the night. I have enjoyed each and everyone of your Undead books. I can't wait to read the new one 
 Another great book  glad i got it  great ideas  
 This was given as a Christmas gift and now a year later, she still LOVES it.  It was easy to install with no hidden surprises and has been holding up very well.    It was exactly what we were looking for 
 Freud engages here in an act of self- denial similar to the one which led him to so worship one student of his , the sole Gentile Jung who later betrayed him. Perhaps it was difficult for Freud in his old age and dying at the time that his own people were helpless before the Nazi murderers to see power and potency in his own people. Moses is of course a symbol of Law and Might and Justice and for the Jews direct contact with God in a way no other human being will ever have. Freud finds a way to deny Moses' Jewishness perhaps as a way of suggesting that if real salvation is to come real power to enter the world it must come through other human beings, not Jews. In any case I see no real evidence for Freud's fiction. The Tannakh the Hebrew Bible certainly clearly and definitely states who Moses and Aharon and Miriam's parents were. It gives their line of descent also as princes of the Tribe of Levi. To deny all this and simply invent an Egyptian prince tale seems to me the height or perhaps depth of historical responsibility. This is a last word of Freud and unfortunately far from a credible one. 
 Kira Kira is a heartwarming and fantastic book! It makes you feel thankful for what you have! I recommend it to kids within the ages of 9-14. I was told by a friend that Kira Kira was a great book and so I decided to give it a try!!! I don't know about u but I am a very picky reader and if I dislike even the begining I most likly won't finish! Enough about me...If you like to read sad book that send you into tears make sure you go 2 the  the nearest book store and pick Kira Kira. 
 I have to say this is a great live album.  I first got turn on to Kraftwerk by a co-worker who had made a compliation of other live CDs.  I bought this on a whim.  I am glad I did 
 We recently purchased two sets of these stools to go in our newly remodled kitchen.  We have natual maple cabintes and these stools match perfectly.  They are a bit smaller that I thought they would be, but actually are the perfect size for the breakfast bar we put in.  A great quality product with a pad that will be very easy to clean or recover.  Thanks 
 The Canon EF 50mm f2.5 macro lens is yet another example of Canon doing a fine job catching up with the likes of Nikon, Zeiss and Leica with respect to optical design; optically it may be the best 50mm macro lens currently available for 35mm SLR film photography. I am impressed that a lens as cheap as this counts at least one aspheric lens element and an apochromatic lens design; unfortunately it is not nearly as durable a lens as the celebrated L series lens line or the Canon EF 100mm macro lens. Unless you are constantly working out in the field taking close-up photography, then the durability of this lens's lens mount and barrel should not be an issue. More importantly for the user is the quality of its images, and having read some test reports on this lens, I have no doubt that it is a capable performer. Those interested in digital macro photography may choose to look instead at the new 60mm macro lens, which is optimized for use with Canon digital SLR cameras 
 This has some really cool songs on it. such a unique voice, and some neat music 
 About half of Vivaldi's sacred vocal music was written for solo voice.  His 'Nisi Domimus' in G minor,RV608, is a comparatively rare example of a Vesper psalm set for solo voice. It is not known for what occasion this was composed, but the setting is remarkable for its variety of style and mood.  The 'Salve Regina' in C minor,RV616,is one of two settings for alto and double orchestra.  The liturgical text for this delicately beautiful composition belongs to one of the four Great Antiphons sung at the end of Vespers.  "Clarie stellae,scintillate,Rv625" is a motet written for performance on the Feast of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (July 2).  "Vestro Principi divino",RV633, is an exhortation to receive the risen Christ, written for performance at the close of Holy Week.  The recording also includes two concerti a quattro(concertos for strings in four parts). To my mind, Paul Dyer and the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra do a fine job interpreting and performing the music of Vivaldi.  While Andreas Scholl does his usual accurate and good singing, keep in mind that there are other countertenors who have recorded this music, particularly the 'Salve Regina' and the 'Nisi Dominus'.  They are Michael Chance and David Daniels, who also do a very fine job of it.  I think it does depend on which type of countertenor you prefer 
 And I own far too many, especially for someone who actually spends time writing Amazon reviews.    This book does a great job of explaining the policy and history-succinctly-behind most of the rules and theories we've covered in class and in the casebook.    I think this is my favorite hornbook, but I give it four stars for not giving as much insight into specific cases as other hornbooks do.  
 I bought this book solely for Brom's stellar artwork, but it's a fun story as well. The writing is a little odd--it reads like an older children's book, or maybe young adult--so the occasional f-bomb (and other epithets) tend to catch me a little off guard (and I swear like a proverbial sailor). I can't say much about the art, really - it's great and it's consistent with his other work, aside from the toy theme. I did catch myself wondering what Toy Story would have looked like had Brom done the art direction. If you're a fan of Brom's work at all, it's certainly worth the price for a fun read and beautiful pictures 
 For those who have read _Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_: This book is essentially a collection of short stories of the same kind as the various snippets included as footnotes in _Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_, but of greater length -- not so much a sequel as a collection of spin-off tales. It even includes at least one story referred to in that book but never detailed therein (the tale of John Uskglass and the Cumbrian charcoal burner). Only one of the stories features either Strange or Norell as characters, but all of them (with the possible exception of "The Duke of Wellington Misplaces his Horse," which is set in or perhaps overlaps with, the setting of Neil Gaiman's _Stardust_) are set in and flesh out the same world. All share the same dryly witty, intelligent, intellectually charming writing style that made the prior novel so worthwhile.  In some ways, this collection shows more technical expertise than _Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_, because the stories include a number of different viewpoints, use different stylistic devices, and achieve a different range of effects than found in the novel. The author has a wider range to play with here, outside the limits of a single novel's plotline, and she takes excellent advantage of that.  For those who have not:   If you like Jane Austen, have a strong taste for 18th or 19th century fiction or fantasy stories,  like  Neil Gaiman's _Stardust_ or Lord Dunsany's works, or find the thought of an  mix of those two sources appealing, this book will probably appeal to you very strongly and I recommend it highly.  It may be the first original short-story collection in a very long time to draw upon the same tradition as the old classics like Howard Pyle's _Wonder Clock_ or the old Andrew Lang _[color] Fairy Books_, with the exception and improvement that this story collection has its own sensibility, style, and manner -- this is not a random medley  of folk tales, but a deliberate product of a skilled writer working to create a specific fantasy milieu. It would be relatively accurate to describe the book as a collection, not of "fairy tales," but of recorded, historical stories about fairies from a world whose history ran (mostly) parallel to our own, but with slightly more magic.  Most of the stories are written with a dry, highly mannered wit, very reminiscent of Jane Austen's writing style -- a deliberate conciet, I'm sure, and very well executed (One of the stories in the collection is an exception, a version of a classic fairy tale written in period Suffolk dialect; it may be the best-executed of the lot).This is "historical fiction" of a very specific kind. Only two stories feature historical characters ("The Duke of Wellington Misplaces his Horse" and "Antickes and Frets," which concerns Mary Queen of Scots), but the setting, tone, and style are all set in the 18th or 19th centuries and executed as if the stories were written by period authors. This is not the sort of "historical fiction" where someone writes a modern thriller and throws a bunch of historical names into the pot as minor characters -- it is historical fiction written (mostly) as if written during the time period wherein the stories were set -- one of them even is even an epistolary story, taking the form of a series of period journal entries and letters.   I don't mean to imply that these stories are derivative, or exact replicas of old fairy tales, or that the style merely mimics Austen's, etc. All of those sources are drawn upon, but a remarkably modern synthesis is achieved -- this is very clearly a modern work, and there are definitely places where sex, violence, and all the other things modern audiences desire show through the mannered veneer of style and tone. But the mannered, wit-charged tone, the period conceits, etc., all are expertly utilized; the reader is left with a definite impression that all of these stories are part of an extant, coherent, and compelling world. Everything in each story fits together, and all of the stories fit together into a whole - even if none of the plotlines intersect, they all hang together in the same general web.   I would not recommend this book to everyone. Some people just aren't going to go for this sort of thing. But if you like any of the stylistic sources on which the author draws, or if you appreciate an author with a clever, unique style, or if you just like masterful writing, then you will almost certainly regret not purchasing a copy of this book. It is hard to imagine this sort of fantasy/historical fiction hybrid being executed more masterfully by anyone. If you read this book and like it, you'll almost certainly find yourself purchasing the novel as well.   A final word on the illustrations: Charles Vess's line-drawing illustrations provide an excellent accompaniment to the text, both in tone and in richness of detail. They achieve much the same sort of balance that the text does,such that the viewer simultaneously realizes they are not period illustrations but is, at the same time, given the impression that could have been. 
    I read "The Meanest Doll in the World" by Ann M. Martin and Laura Godwin. I would give "The Meanest Doll in the World" 5 stars because when I read the book I thought that the authors used good details to describe what was going on. Also you can tell what the protangonists are thinking. I read this book because it sounded interesting to me and after I was done reading it I was glad I picked it.    I have only read "The Meanest Doll in the World" by Ann M. Martin and Laura Godwin. I would like to read more books by them because of the details they put into their writing and how well they describe the setting.    There were two protangonists, Tiffany and Annabele. Tiffany is adventurous and brave, she is ready for anything. Annabelle is not as brave as Tiffany, she is shy. The antagonist Mimi is a menace to all dolls. She thinks she is a princess and wants to make everyone her friend.    The type of reader that would want to read this book is someone who likes adventurous books and dolls. If you are the type of person who likes sad books with a sad ending you will hate this book, but if you like adventure and dolls you will love this book 
 I CAN'T believe there was a reviewer who said it was "boring"! I have bought this book at least 5 or 6 times because I've lent my copy to people and never got it back because everyone thought it was so good. (No worries, those people were family....figured I'd overlook it *this* time). I've also read it at least 4 times over the past few years. It's simply wonderful; it delves into your heart and stays there. You will not regret purchasing this book 
 A MUST READ for all women who have undergone a c-section, and women who want to avoid one in the future. Empowering, brutally honest and revealing, this a great book for midwives, doulas, and their clients, as well as first-time expectant mothers. 5 stars! 
 Dr. Willard is very thorough in his writing which makes for some strenuous reading, but remains very rewarding throughout.  Dallas really drives the point home that "apprentice" is a superior term to "disciple" as far as our relationship to Christ should be.  You realize that "putting on the character of Christ" is a cooperative process between you and God in that he supplies the grace enacted through our obedience.   It's imperative for the church to resist the distractions that impede her spiritual transformation and pursue apprenticeship to Jesus instead of the traditional discipleship "programs", or worse yet, none at all.  The Divine Conspiracy and this book would be great places to start in the education 
 As always L.K.H delivers, but this book had more drama than I expected. I'm not a drama person, but i really enjoied the book. L.K.H. always delivers 
 If you think working as a spy means flirting with the receptionist before popping in to see the head of the secret service and then dropping down to the basement to pick up the gadgets you will need for your mission, this book will help give you a reality check.  The British need a mole in East Germany so they pretend to fire one of their top agents by faking a problem with alcohol.  The former spy gets a job in a bookstore.  He works beside a young woman who just happens to be a low-level member of the Socialist party.  He befriends her, and while she falls in love with him, he uses her to get inside the apparatus in East Germany.  While you read the rest of the story, you get that dirt-in-your teeth feeling, like you might have after a very rough outdoor contact sport.  You also find out that a spy agency cannot afford to be compassionate.  If you really want to know the sacrifices made by the brave men and women who work for our intelligence agencies, this book will give you a pretty good taste.  However, it may be a taste that lingers long after you have put the book down 
 I've only glanced at a few pages of the book, and already I can tell that I'm going to learn a lot about coming up in the film industry. I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and Robert Rodriguez is one of my favourite directors. Learning about how he came up is just what I need to plan my big break. Thanks Rob 
 Vicki Caruana has hit the nail on the head with this book!  It speaks directly to not just homeschoolers but everyone who needs help with the organization of daily life.  Based on Biblical principles Mrs. Caruana has explained that God is the perfect organizer and expects us to be "in His image".  Thank you Vicki for your timely wisdom in a very un-organized time 
 The film "Repo Man" is a bit dated, and yet it's still a fun watch. And I think that being a little dated makes it an even better film. Many films, especially from the 1970's to the mid 1980s have not stood the test of time. "Repo Man" does. From the punkish Otto (Emilio Estevez) to (Harry Dean Stanton) the film is as enjoyable [if not more] than when it was first released. I remember when I first watched the film, and thought how clever Nesmith was to include Otto's parents. When you see Otto's parents and their total devotion to the televangelist [very popular at the time] and being totally mesmerized by him that they send him all their money; you begin to understand that Otto's a hell of a lot more normal and sane than society would have us believe.       Also, the film is so full of funny and witty dialogue; from Otto's boss, to his newfound employer (Harry Dean Stanton), that every time I view the film I see something else that I didn't see before: Or saw it, but now see it differently. I think this is the best Harry Dean Stanton role too. His character is hilarious. A straight and narrow guy, [sort of], who winds up being funny. I don't think the film would have succeeded without him. I found it particularly funny when the Repo Men are talking about John Wayne and how it's okay to wear dresses. Or when Otto tries to steal a car and winds up getting beaten up. There are many, many funny and witty parts of the film [too many to go into]. I think the film is funny, witty and hasn't lost its charm after so many years. Highly recommended! [Stars: 4.5] 
 Does anyone know the song played in the movie thats starts when sean penn y talkin' to nicole kidman and she goes to sleep with the phone (this sceane is before she gets in the bus that explotes)...PLEASE HELP 
 I found this book a wonderful and honest account of Iranian culture and what really happened during the revolution.  I was only 7 years old when the revolution in Iran changed everything and effected everyone's life.  I never understood why this happened.  Why they shot down my American School.  Why my dad couldn't work any more and he lost millions and millions of government contracts.  Why our freedom of choice was taken away from us.  And why many of us left Iran, never to look back.  This book definitely shed light on my life long questions.  I learned a chapter of history that is never thaught in schools. Great book 
 I purchased this perfume as a gift.  It arrived in excellent condition and in a timely fashion.  Of course, the person I bought it for loves the perfume.  I would definitely purchase from this seller again.  Thanks for the pleasant shopping experience. 
 This is just your basic old classic movie.  we enjoyed it when it first came out and had it taped on a old vcr tape and wanted it in dvd.  Still enjoy it 
 This is one of the great albums of all time.The melodies and prose are exceptional.They clearly linger 11 years after first hearing this album.The beauty of this album will never leave those who care to invest 1% of their soul 
 This album defines the term classic.  This album came out when I was 13 years old, 36 years ago, and the music still sounds good as ever today.  Grand Funk introduced a style of music through this album that I had been looking for.  In those early years I was forming a taste for good blues based rock, but there was nothing else out at the time that really appealed to me.  Most of what was popular and what my friends were listening to was mostly "bubble-gum" music and not serious rock and roll.  I continued to follow GFR for many years, but this alblum always stands out as their best.  Later albums contained ballads and attempts at using other musical influences, but the "Red Album" rocks all the way through.  "Got This Thing on the Move" is probably my favorite cut, but it's hard to pick any in particular cause they're all so good.  "Paranoid" is another excellent cut as well as "Inside Lookin' Out."  Any serious classic rock fan needs...no, MUST have this classic album...just buy it and see for yourself 
 Emma Thompson has hit on a goldmine!  I wish now I could buy a copy of the screenplays of ALL my favorite movies with diaries full of behind-the-scenes secrets!  Fantastic job, Emma!  The diary is hysterical  and now I enjoy watching the movie again with a new perspective--an  insider's perspective.  But Emma didn't say how the scene came about where  Fanny flips out with Lucy's news of her engagement to Edward.  That was a  riot and not in the script--who thought it up?! 
 Anthony Parinello's book teaches the very basic foundamental concept of selling to any business customers. Before selling anything, any smart, high level sales person should consider what business value their product or solution provides. As a sales person, we often forget how important it is to be a provider of a business solution rather than a box pusher. Although it would differ by industry, this book maps out the basic guideline needed for any sales person to be successful. I highly recommend this book to anyone just starting a career selling technology or types of sales position. 
 This book written by Dr. Harlan Lane is more that profound. It has the power to solidify any HOH or Oral Deaf persons identity. His book is written as he sees the world though a Deaf persons struggle in a hearing  world and goes well beyond to explain what it is really like to be Deaf. I  highly recomend this book for everyone 
 Interest has recently accelerated in human visits to our celestial neighbor, as is evidenced in this book with its wide collection of essays on the subject, in the new NASA program and announced plans from almost all the other major spacefaring nations, but also in the coincidental simultaneous release of another book with the same title, from astronaut Harrison Schmitt. Both books are worth the serious interest of anybody wondering what all the fuss is about.  Tumlinson and Medlicott's book brings forward the views of a number of people who have been advocating for a lunar return for some time, and this collection is a good way to get to know them. The arguments put forward are forceful and at times contradictory, but for somebody familiar with space development ideas, they are also quite familiar. Tourism, astronomy, precious metals, materials for space-based solar panels, or simply oxygen as a propellant provide economic incentives for lunar development. Many of the essays argue for a strong private component to lunar development, making use of lunar resources to earn profitable returns here on Earth.  Others of the essays see a strong government responsibility, at least in early phases, driven largely by scientific interest in the Moon itself, and by the potential, as General Pete Worden points out, for the Moon to be the ultimate site to develop risky technologies that might be too dangerous to pursue on Earth. Beyond the private/public debate and the surfeit of justifications, a number of the essays also express strong opinions on engineering details such as design of rocket boosters and lunar landers.  One suspects that if space advocates figured out a way to actually agree on things, we might have returned to the Moon years ago. And to some extent these debates are moot for now, as NASA lays out its plans and other nations seem determined to follow.  A few of these essays provide longer-range views on space settlement and development. As Andrew Chaikin writes, the Moon will be a "catalyst for humanity's transformation into an interplanetary species." Frank White here talks of the "Overview Effect", the profound importance to a human being of physically seeing Earth as a "small planet suspended in space," and he and several others here envision thousands of people having that direct experience in permanent settlements on the lunar surface.  Several essays delve into the legal issues - what current law applies, and what new law would be useful, to a lunar colony? Alan Wasser lays out his "Space Settlement Initiative" proposal, to fund space development with lunar land grants based on proven performance, a variant on the "prize" approaches recently in the news. A noteworthy essay from Robert Richards points out that the Moon is really two distinct destinations: the near side and the far side. The far side would be much more isolated from Earth, and potentially much better preparation for the eventual colonization of Mars.  Inspirational color illustrations, not directly refered to in the text, are provided in the middle of the book; a "lunar declaration" that it's time to return comes at the end, along with a section of Moon Facts. One notable omission is an index - with the diversity of topics the table of contents isn't always sufficient to locate relevant discussion.  This book should definitely be read by anybody who questions the point of NASA's current plans for a lunar base. As astronomer Yoji Kondo writes in two of the essays here, science and exploration need to go together, each will enable the other, and robots and humans together will expand the human experience beyond anything we now know. Whether through NASA, the private sector, or the work of other nations, humans will be living and working on the Moon in coming decades and, as the best of these essays makes clear, that small step will change humanity forever 
 This is a reprint of The Harmony Guide to 100's More Crochet Stitches.   Volumes 1-5 are all about knitting; volumes 6 & 7 are the crochet  instructions. This has to be one of the most useful crochet books I have  ever encountered.  Volumes 6 & 7 together show you how to do basic  stitches, laces, clusters, filet, shells, bobbles, loops, edgings &  trimmings, some Irish crochet, various "motif" patterns, and  Tunisian (Afghan) crochet stitches.  The photos and diagrams are all in  full color and the explanations are the best I have ever seen.  Truly, they  are worth every penny!  If you can only get 2 books on crochet, get these 
 This is the seventh entry in the Elm Creek Quilt series and although the familiar characters from the other Elm Creek Quilt are missing, Chiaverini does return to Creek's Crossing, Pennsylvania, but the time frame is just prior to the Civil War. The premise is a very interesting one, and there is presently on going research to authenticate the use of quilts for use as markers along the Underground Railroad. Nineteen-year-old Dorothea Granger, is the niece of cantankerous uncle Jacob. Uncle and niece do not get along, although she respects his hard work and quiet devotion to his bible, so she is quite surprised when he requests that she make him a quilt to his exact specifications. Dorothea, along with her parents, has her farm duites to take care of, and she also teaches at the local school. Her dreams of education and career have been unfullfilled due to her parents financial failure and that's why they have come to live with Uncle Jacob. Her younger brother, Jonathan, is studying medicine in Boston and is seen as the likely heir to the farm, so Dorothea's parents must make the best of it. Dorothea knowing this, agrees to make the quilt for her uncle, even though it takes her away from her Library fund raising committee responsiblity. The committee is to raffle a fine quilt in order to raise funds to build the town a new library. The Granger family are staunch in their belief that slavery is wrong, and soon, through unforseen circumstances, they become embroiled in helping slaves through the Underground Railroad. I gave this book four stars only because the ending seemed a bit rushed to me, but the story itself is wonderful. If you like quilting, adventure, historical fiction, or just to read a good story, then pick up this book and enjoy! 
 This book is not just a "solutions manual."  There are detailed proofs for all of the problems in the book.  This book is essential if you want to truly learn real analysis 
 The Land Where the Blues Began is one of the finest books on any subject I've ever read in my life. Every magical benefit of reading came poring forth from its pages, including deep and fascinating discovery, chills, outrage, tears, joy, laughter, amazement and finally, understanding and awe. Alan Lomax embarked on a personal odyssey to the Mississippi Delta serving up one of the great vicarious thrill rides any reader with a hankering to learn where rock and roll, and rhythm and blues came from. Armed with primitive recording equipment and a lifetime's experience researching the folk and popular music of the world (following in his father's distinguished footsteps in this endeavor), Lomax plunges us directly into the redneck towns and the plantations, where the Blues emerged from a fascinating combination of African musical roots, Folk...Popular...and Church Music, and the hollers which slaves, prisoners, levee workers, rail gangs, mule drivers, sharecroppers and roustabouts would sing out to express their rage, pain, heartsickness, loneliness, hopelessness and frustrations. Finding giants of the blues in dilapidated shacks in the middle of nowhere, Lomax coaxed many into performing for his acetate machines. Also haunting the bars, with names such as the Dipsy Doodle, in the black sectors of heavily segregated towns, Lomax (who is white) repeatedly puts his personal safety in jeopardy as he defies the redneck deputies' orders and ends up swigging homemade whiskey and eating fresh barbecue while recording legendary performances. If all this weren't enough, the book weaves the evolution of the Blues in  with poignant memoirs of impoverished childhoods, family life, prison life, farm labor, Jim Crow, unthinkable mistreatment, murder, and devastation. Fashioning musical instruments out of pieces of wire and wooden boxes, tree branches or anything available, these masters created, nurtured and passed down their knowledge to subsequent generations until it flowered in the hands of a young and inspired new crop of Blues giants. Eventually blacks seeking a better way of life were able to move North into the urban areas of Chicago, New York, Kansas City and other places, and the adventurous among the Blues musicians followed them there, where the Blues kept people in touch with their roots and linked them emotionally to their Southern heritage. Here, the musicians were horribly exploited by white recording executives who invited them to record their music, and robbed them blind when a recording did well on the radio and/or in the stores. Eventually the mature Blues style inspired the world's greatest pop and rock musicians from the Rolling Stones and The Beatles to Eric Clapton, all of whom were British and discovered American Blues music at its commercial inception. Later, they introduced it back to the American masses who had for the most part not yet been exposed to it. As I finished the book, I was awestruck that these impoverished yet heroic people who lived in the shacks, shouting their laments to the cotton fields and the sky above, had a massive and magnificent influence on the world which few human beings will ever achieve. Hats off to Blind Lemon Jefferson, Son House, Robert Johnson, Fred McDowell, Big Bill Broonzy, Muddy Waters and so many others, especially the now-forgotten faceless progenitors of the style, without whom today's popular music would have an entirely different and far less rich character. And three cheers for Alan Lomax whose passion and love for the people and music he documents, coupled with his original and rich writing style leaves us in an emotional heap at the end of our journey 
 This is not the book to read if you're looking for a how-to guide to Wicca. This is, however, one of the first books I would recommend to someone who is interested in Wicca. It reads like a textbook at points, and it is dated (being published in 1979), but it is a wonderful view of the early history of Wicca in America 
 I have been collecting the audio discs of "The American Folk Blues Festival" for many years with great anticipation that the mythic video documents would someday be released.  Happily those and some new performances are included on this DVD output along with the others in the series.  The performances are absolute gems.  This disc is a mix of studio and live performances that are so great they bring a tear of joy to my eye.  Most of the performers were so rarely filmed that it is a real delight to see them perform.  The set list is identified above, but it is worthy of note that the musicians backing up the "A" list track artists are a who's who of blues legends.    I can't pick a favorite cut as they are all wonderful, but to see Otis Rush backing Big Joe Turner, or the ultra rare filmed appearance of Little Walter blowing harp for Hound Dog Taylor (four years before Hound Dog's stellar Alligator debut incidentally), or Buddy Guy's supper cool reading of "Out Of Site", or the main man, T-Bone Walker, backing Helen Humes, etc. is a treat beyond explanation.  The amazing Earl Hooker and Muddy Waters are bonus track features with Paul Oscher making a very cool appearance on "Got My Mojo Working."  Run time is about an hour on this disc.  If you are a fan of music, especially blues, then you need this three volume DVD set, now. 
 If you nibble on this book with some friends, a case at a time, it can help you hone your skills as a counselor.  Adams goal is to teach readers to be more perceptive and accurate in identifying common problems. In addition, Adams tries to give practice in applying the Scriptures to these problems wisely.  How do you help someone salvage a marriage, or conquer depression, or learn to be a good friend?  Adams provides plenty of practice is a variety of scenarios.  He is intentionally ambiguous and open-ended (reviewers really must read introductions before writing reviews!) because counselling so often starts that way.    The book is helpful because it gives the reader practice and opportunities to grow in wisdom before they rush out and "practice" on someone with a pulse.  Used rightly, it can be most helpful. But by no means read it straight through.  It is to be reflected on and discussed--with a Bible and a pen at the ready. This takes longer, to be sure. But that's the point. Wisdom is costly. 
 Autobiography that starts two generations ago. Those readers accustomed to the usual self-serving political memoir will be plesantly surprised. McCain's book begins with mini bios of both his father and his grandfather, hence the title. While the early third of the book dealing with his family tree may be a bit slow going once he gets into his own bio in the middle third, the book really starts to heat up.     John's willingness to reveal his own personal peccadillos and weaknesses is truly refreshing for a former and hopefully future Presidential candidate. For example, in the chapter entitled Low Grease, John recounts a quite hilarious anecdote about a visit to meet his girfriend's proper Main Line Philadelphia family for the first time. Unfortunately his train connections allowed him to accept the offers of several fellow travelers to join them for some beers.  He relates how, after several hours of drinking at the 30th Street Station in Philly, he finally catches the last train to the girl's town.  You can easily conjur the vision of him making his grand entrance wearing his Naval Academy Dress White Uniform.   The book really becomes a page-turner in the final third when John details in often excrutiating detail his time spent in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp now infamously known as the Hanoi Hilton.  His descriptions are surprisingly not tinged with bitterness or rancor.  Apparently enough time has elapsed to allow his mental (but not physical) wounds to heal.  This period details how the POWs used various mental techniques to  survive, how they created alternative means of communication, how they organized and how they relied on one another.    The book ends with his and his fellow POWs release from the POW camp. This abrupt ending clearly leaves the readers hungry for more information, more narrative of his post-POW life. Luckily there are other later John McCain volumes which are available to nourish the hungry reader.  But that's another review.    This volume should be required reading for all students of the Vietnam War and for every American regardless of their age, race, gender or poltical party. 
 This Oscar -nominated film has the legendary Cary Grant (1904-1986 ) as goverment attorney who can?t seem to shake his bad fortune . Living on a houseboat , widomed and left with three unruly children , he hires Sophia Loren (1934- ) as governess . The magnetic Loren and the Charming Grant add up to  Cheeky , urbane Comedy . Wonderful movie with many outdore scenes a realy romantic and funny movie , High Quality transfer . Recommended . 
 easy to read format, great visual examples, things you ve been taught from school but sometimes forget to think about 
 This is an amazing soundtrack. I have heard very few soundtracks that fit the film as perfectly as this one. The main theme is haunting and unforgettable. If you are someone who wants to close your eyes and be transported to another place,this is the music for you 
 Film Noir at it's Best. Lies, Betrayal, Deception, Sexual Eroticism. All through the movie You dont know who to cheer for, THe Cop, The Dirty Teacher, The Trailer Trash Chic, The Funny Lawyer, THe School Tramp, The Tramp's MOther, THe Cop's Partner, The Tramp's Mother Cuban LOver. You dont know who is who and what is up or down.  ONe big Dirty Camp of a Movie..to describe it with only one word it would be....... YUMMY 
 One of the reviewers here boldly declare Sagan as ill-informed because "...[Sagan] was not able to find out the Creator of the Universe, even though he was equipped with a brilliant mind."  This is not a book (or TV series) in search of the answer to explain the/a "creator", and Sagan's presentation never points in that direction. Rather, Cosmos is a summary of the historical and modern scientific view of many different aspects of the universe and life on earth.  The reviewer in question is aghast that Sagan would suggest things that the reviewer's mind is unable to accept: "...every mystery, beauty, harmony in the Universe is ascribed to pure coincidence. To [Sagan], somehow the galaxies, planets etc. were formed after the Big Bang by chance. Then, somehow some amino acids came together (?) and after a few steps formed (?) a living cell. Living cells somehow learned to reproduce (?) and this led to more complex organisms (?). The life started in water, these "fish" then decided to continue (?) their life on land. Could this extremely long sequence of nearly improbable coincidences be the cause of our existence on Earth, in addition to the exquisite harmony and beauty in the Universe, or is there a super-human, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent Creator?"  Those who may share this view can read other, more narrowly-focused books on the subject of evolution, such as The Blind Watchmaker by Dawson, which clearly explains the basic flaw of this line of thinking: evolution is NOT a result of "coincidences" as many people think. To the contrary, the scientific view of evolution implies (as Dawson points out in the Watchmaker) that evolution is not only NOT a result of "coincidences", but an unavoidable certainty based on the conditions and time-span.  So, if you want to ponder about your existence and evolution, read "The Blind Watchmaker", "The Selfish Gene" or the "Climb Mount Improbable". Cosmos, on the other hand, is a great scientist's legacy to create more questions in the mind of the reader/viewer than to provide answers for meaning of life. 
 I keep this book by my desk as I'm designing. It's wonderfully inspirational, clear and concise. The golden section is not the easiest of concepts to wrap your head around, never mind using it in practice. Kimbery makes these concepts far easier to grasp. Kudos to Kimberly for finding creative ways to clearly illustrate what is best categorized as an interesting phenomenon. I appreciate the wide selection of real life examples she prepared, citing examples from nature, art, design and manufacturing. If the transparency pages aren't lining up exactly with the images below them don't fret. These are meant to help you understand the structural framework of the work being described, nothing more. This book has inspired both my professional and personal work. I hate math and I was never any good at. If I can love this book so can you. Start using the golden section in your work and you'll be hooked 
 This book is absolutely incredible.  I couldn't put it down.. I only wish it were longer 
 It is now November 2006 and I still can't take it out of my deck. I also have it in my MP3 player. I went to the Concert in May 2005 and believe the band keeps getting better and better. I await their next album. Buy this one though 
 String theory has been criticized since it was first invented but not to the degree that it has now, this criticism mostly focusing on its failure to connect with observation. The criticism has increased dramatically in recent years however, and some of this has been too vituperative to be useful to those curious about string theory as a viable physical theory. But criticism, however harsh, can be healthy, since it motivates the proponents of a theory to more carefully elucidate its foundations and content. This is usually not the case when a theory is popular, as researchers are in a competitive spirit and are hesitant to share the knowledge to possible competitors. At this stage in the game however, string theorists it seems are now on the defensive, and have thus taken the time to discuss in-depth what this reviewer still believes is the most complex and beautiful theory ever constructed in mathematical physics. String theory still has a long way to go before it gains status as being a physical theory, but hopefully by the end of the next few decades one will see the appearance of charts, graphs, and numerical calculations in books on string theory, much like one finds in the most successful of all physical theories to date: relativistic quantum field theory.  Some highlights in the book that are particularly insightful include: 1. The observation that Dirichlet boundary conditions (for the open string) break Poincare invariance, but that this leads to the introduction of Dp-branes as positions of the endpoints of the open string. Poincare invariance is recovered as long as Dp-brane is space filling, i.e. has a dimension one less than the background spacetime.   2. The view that the BRST quantization of the path integral is really a conformal field theory. This is interesting in that BRST analysis is typically thought of as a procedure for quantizing constrained systems (gauge theories being predominant examples).  3. The `Myers effect'. Sometimes referred to as the `D-brane dielectric effect', it is part of an attempt to understand the physics of non-Abelian D-branes for strong fields. One of the challenges in this understanding involves the validity of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action in these kinds of circumstances, which as the authors remark is designed for situations where the background fields and world-volume gauge fields do not vary appreciably over the distances on the order of the string scale.  4. The origin of the (classical) Virasoro algebra as the freedom of choice of gauge in the reparametrization symmetry. And along these same lines, the quantization of the Virasoro algebra is defined to the normal ordering of the Virasoro generators, and their commutators give an expression consisting of the ordinary classical term plus a "quantum" correction, the famous central extension. Thus the quantum Virasoro algebra can be viewed as a "quantum deformation" of the classical Virasoro algebra, with the central parameter as being the deformation parameter. This philosophy of deformation has found generalization in what are now called `quantum groups' (even though strictly speaking they are much more complicated objects than ordinary groups).  5. The connection of the dilaton to the Euler characteristic.  6. The role of the GSO projection in insuring consistency in the state spectrum.  7. The use of (vector bundle) K-theory to classify D-brane charges. This use arises when it is realized that the conserved R-R charges cannot be identified with cohomology classes of gauge field configurations. Instead, the D-branes are classified by K-theory classes.  8. The discussion on `primitive cohomology' and its relation to de Rham cohomology and Hodge theory.  9. The role of the Born-Infeld structure in ensuring Lorentz invariance of the T-dual description. The Born-Infeld action was once viewed as a mere historical curiosity, namely as a nonlinear generalization of the Maxwell theory, with no experimental backing. That it finds such a natural place in string theory is very interesting (but still of course lacking in experimental support).  10. The derivation of a lower bound for Newton's constant from heterotic M-theory, which is close to the observed value.  11. The argument, beautifully elucidated in this book, that type IIA supergravity may be obtained from 11-dimensional supergravity by dimensional reduction.  12. The discussion on warped space-times and the gauge hierarchy. The authors cleverly motivate this subject by asking why Newtonian gravity follows an inverse-square law rather than an inverse-cube law.  13. An entire chapter is devoted to "stringy" geometry, which is a fascinating subject given that it touches so many areas of modern mathematics.  14. The discussion of the `hidden sector' and its conjectured relation to dark matter and supersymmetry breaking.  15. The author's treatment of the AdS/CFT conjecture is superb and is by far the most interesting part of the book. The dualities shown to exists between gauge theory and string theory are a possible route to a full understanding of nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics, which to this date has defied resolution.   Some major omissions or discussions that need more elaboration include: 1. The difficulties that are actually involved in quantizing the Nambu-Goto action. The authors remark that this is due to the presence of the square root, but it would have been interesting if they would have indicated just where the trouble rises explicitly when a quantization procedure is attempted with the Nambu-Goto action. In ordinary quantum field theory, the presence of the square root is interpreted as a "nonlocal" problem, but even there this issue is not usually dealt with in a manner that is very transparent.  2. A more detailed treatment of string field theory for those readers who want to compare it to what is done in second quantization in ordinary quantum field theory.  3. The role of the Beltrami differentials in the attaining of a measure for moduli space that is invariant under reparametrizations of the moduli space.  4. No in-depth discussion of characteristic classes over and above the algebra involved in their manipulation (i.e. the wedge products). An understanding of characteristic classes is crucial to understanding superstring and brane theory, but the pages of this book mislead the unsuspecting reader that there is nothing to characteristic classes except algebraic manipulation of the differential forms. But characteristic classes have a deep geometrical meaning, and obtaining insight into this meaning has been proven to be difficult for students of string theory. This book does not provide any of this insight, nor do any of the other books currently in print on string theory.  5. Is supersymmetry absolutely necessary for the incorporation of fermions into string theory? The authors seem to argue that it is, but an explicit proof is lacking.  6. The proof that `threshold bound states' are stable is omitted, disappointing the more mathematically sophisticated reader. As the authors remark, the proof involves a special type of index theory involving non-Fredholm operators, and where one must deal with a continuous spectrum. The usual index theory breaks down since one is only dealing with elliptic operators, and contributions to the index from bosons and fermions do not necessarily have to be integers.  7. The authors should have included more discussion on mirror symmetry, beautiful subject that it is.  8. Dp-branes are asserted to be useful in incorporating non-Abelian gauge symmetries in string theory, in that they appear "naturally" as confined to world volumes of multiply-coincident Dp-branes. But is this the best way to introduce these symmetries? Is there a method, other than this one and `compactification', that is just as "natural" and does not have the contrived element that the introduction of Dp-branes sometimes has?  9. The authors need to elaborate in more detail on the definition of "stable" and "unstable" D-brane.  10. The omitting of the proof that string theories are ultraviolet finite theories of quantum gravity. This is by far the most serious omission in the book. This reviewer does not know of a reference that proves this assertion, and many in the physics community have pointed to this omission as being a sign that the string theory research community has been misled by false assertions of proof. 
 I received the product in the expected delivery time and it works great with my XP operating system that is running on my Apple computer via the Parallels software.  I downloaded the software to run the Interface from the Polar site.  Did not need the small CD that ships with the product  (which was too small for my CD drive) 
 This is an excellent documentary of Shangri-La and its elusive transcendental nature 
 This book was passed onto me in a box that a friend didn't feel like packing.  I'm always skeptical of national book club choices, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  Obviously, you can read above for the book summary.  That being said, I felt I was able to get to know all the members of the Morrison family through Lawson's writing, even if the story was narrated entirely by Kate.  The story jumps back and forth between the past and the present, but isn't difficult to follow.    My only complaint is that the story ended before I ever learned if Matt and Kate truly reconnected.  It seems the author was on her way to resolving this issue, and then the book simply ended, an issue I've encountered in much of my reading lately 
 This book defies the categories that are given to it.  Science Ficiton, Fantasy, Horror.  It really is none of these things.  I am not going to tell you that if you like Machen or Lovecraft, then you will love this book.  I very much dislike Machen and Lovecraft, and that particular genre as well.  Hodgson is weird, but he does not go out of his way to convince or to push off his beliefs on the reader.  He speaks of his own experience, so to share with the reader of the amazing, and he does this very well.  He actually has sever places in this book where he states these facts, and you see the credible nature of his narrative, and you are not forced to see his point of view to enjoy the story.  This fact is one of the main reasons that I enjoyed this work immensely.  Then, of course, there is the aspect of the language employed, a romantic english that verges past Victorian all the way to middle english.  This makes the book hard to read, but it is in the way I have always looked for in the fantasies that I read.  If forces you to read the book in intervals.  Sometimes, minutely, sometimes daily, even yearly.  It took me four and a half years to read this book, and although I admit that it was hard to read, (not a child's first book), it was this aspect that made me cherish this work more.  I always wanted a book that I could savor, and not read all the way through in two days.  Like Vonngegut, for instance.  I like Vonnecgut, but you have to work hard to remember the scenery and plot, whereas with a more challenging read such as "The Night Land", the imagery is something that will stick with you for the rest of your life.  Like Hodgson does with his writing, I will not try to convince you to read this book by telling you the story, and try to pass off the story on the merit of the story.  All I can say is that it is not a book someone should read who does not understand grammar, such as a High School student.  However, If you appreciate eternal imagery with a quality of the strange, then you will be glad you read this book all the way through.   I can finish this review by telling you that I will never read this book a second time.  I had to work very hard to finish this book, and I will always reamember (especially the island) the subtle breaks of non-continuity that made my resuming the book after a time, and the moments I decided I would put it down to read my other book.  More books should be as ambitious as Hodgson's premeire work.  Even though I will not read it again (if you can finish it, you don't need to), I will read "The Dream of X" which is a condensed version of the story, and remember all of the deleted scenes as if they actually happened.  I look forward to reading "The Dream of X".  If you read the book, you will too 
 I love the old Kenny Chesney, but no so much the new stuff.  I think he's gone downhill since No Shoes, No Shirt.  For an old fan or a new fan, this is a must have CD.  It has all of the songs that really highlight his voice and the types of songs that he sings well.  It is also just catchy enough that fans of his new stuff will like it, too 
 This book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low-income communities of color in New York City. Necessary reading for those who still do not  realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which  marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further  fragment and disenfranchise them 
 I want to give credit to Bryan Wittenmyer for writing a highly informative piece on low-end housing investments.  However I do not feel that low-end housing is the way to go.  These types of properties will appreciate the least, yet they involve the most hassles. You really have to get a good deal to make it worth it and get cash flow 
 Ok, so you want to start your own business but do not have a business degree? Don't know the rules of the game? Then do buy this book and read it thoroughly. I still use it as a guide in my little internet startup that I formed a few years ago. A must have for anyone with no business background but still wants to make it big : 
 This work drifted into earshot after reading more closely Dylan's insightful notes in,'Biograph' where Sexton's prodigious talents get passing mention. Little did I know that said Charlie was to figure as guitar support with one of Dylan's touring bamds in the 90s. Following the most oblique and casual remarks of Dylan has always been rewarding. It helped me stumble on his buddy, James Dickerson's brilliant,'Free Beer Tomorrow'. And so to Sexton, whose ,'Wishing Tree' gloves beutifully with,'Free Beer', if your into a southern-fried sort of mood. There is so much quality music issuing from the Lone Star State it's just not feasible, granted the size of the entertainment market, for all wannabes to get the big spotlight. But Sexton is decidely worthy of a brighter beam than has, thus far, fallen on him. The panoramic, atmospheric scape of the Lanois school of sound is evident throughout. Someone has been listening to their ,'Joshu Tree' to great effect.'Neighbourhood' and the title track kick off the set and its hold is sustained throughout. I love the despairing,'Everyone Will Crawl's' dream of flying where the singer climbs a moutain, sneaks up on a man with his notebook of stone. It's quasi religious mutterings of first learning the humble path of crawling strike as aptly expressing the simple, but far from simplistic honesty of Sexton's muse. Jim Crace's book,'Quarantine' came to mind. It's a generous sampling and if I have a quibble (as with the lengthy Joseph Arthur's,'Redemption's Son') I'd have left the last two tracks for another date to toughen the impact 
  Aside from a traditional recount of the important white guys who did everything, Mr. Schneider captures the essence of the people throughout the modern eras. His time with modern trappers, loggers and bureaucrats capture the sense of urgency for anybody involved in the Park. Initially sought as a farming area after the strategic significance of the French and Revolutionary Wars, lumber and mining interests drove the Park after the attempt to cultivate a place with only 10 percent of its land arable. Mining was sort of disaster at first with many tragic elements. The descriptions of the old facilities as they sit or stand now was a pretty neat journalistic trick.  The historical portrayal of notables like Sir William Johnson and John Brown were real page turners. I've seen the signs just outside Lake Placid to John Brown's house and always thought it was the John Brown involved in the early 19th Century, not the infamous abolitionist. The tragic story of Mr. Henderson and his death in front of his eleven year old son was a real gut wrencher for any tough guy. It seems like there were at least half a dozen fellows who spawned the model for Fenimore's Natty Bumppo. Roger's Rangers, famous guides, French Aristocracy's designs and numerous other affairs and plans sets up a lot of good story telling.  I would still like know why places like Pottersville are called what they are. Where the summer camps were located and who went there. Famous painters, philosophers and robber barons are all very interesting. Knowing the issues and their implications of the future is very important too. Beating them to death is certainly something another volume must do. Fortunately this effort doesn't digress too much into any of these arenas without qualifications and genuine purpose. The real gems are the conversations with loggers like John Courtney and trappers like Toby Edwards. Each offer a unique perspective on the lives they have chosen in this region. Death & Taxes and the Price of Otter in China are two of the best chapters in the book.  Having told a number of people who frequent the Park about this book. I wish that I could give this book to one of them with assurance that it would be read and passed along. I'm sure this is the exact feeling of those with intimate knowledge and time in this vast area. A little bit of everything and everybody is covered in a well told story that spans centuries. I've yet to find the haunting image of Thomas Cole's Course of Empire. I'm sure that when I do it will serve as a guidepost to all that man is and will be in relation to the massive presence of nature in relation to the foibles of man. Certainly the small amount of time left to me on this planet will afford numerous jaunts to some of the treasures scattered about the six million acres that serves as model to the notion, forever wild.

 My sons, 4 and 8, saw this book at a well know book store and loved it.  It costs $20.00 there, so $13.00 is a steal.  They love the pictures and the book is very attractive and "cool" looking 
 Graham Greene presents the story of a priest and his trials and tribulations in a Mexican Socialist state where Catholicism has been outlawed, priests are executed, and the mere possession of a religious article results in imprisonment and hard labor.  In the midst of this turmoil we find a self-professed "whisky priest", the last priest in his state, on the run from authorities.  The state has turned its peasants against the church through propaganda and terror.  The current reality for the priest is one where most shun him and refuse to help.  And when he does have the opportunity to perform a religious ritual, there must be constant surveillance of the police, for once in police custody he will be shot.  Greene does a brilliant job of allowing the reader to enter the priest's innermost thoughts.  This is not a typically pious priest.  He is a drinker, a fornicator, and an absentee father.  He comes to grip with the reality that he is a "bad priest" and laments the fact that he cannot do more to help.  Indeed, he realizes that it was his pride and sense of self-importance that prevented him from leaving the hostile state.  He is filled with self-doubt and self-loathing.  Even as he awaits his execution, he never considers himself a martyr, but merely a failure who will meet God with "empty hands."  However, the priest may be too self-critical.  His religious duties and devotions are a powerful force that brings him back into harm's way when the opportunity to escape persecution is open to him.  Indeed, after an arduous journey across the rain-soaked jungle mountains into a safe state, he nevertheless journeys back into the hostile state to hear the confession of a murderer he has never met, knowing full well that this is a trap from which he will not escape.  It is this sense of duty and inevitable death that lifts the priest above the morality of the villagers and his captors.  Although he may not be a typical martyr or saint, he does hold considerable power with those he meets, although he may not realize it.  Indeed, this "whiskey priest" has changed the lives, subtly or directly, of scores of people he has encountered.  Although Greene, a devout Catholic, portrays the priest an imperfect sinner, I would not call this book anti-Catholic, as did his contemporaries in the church.  The priest is certainly not perfect, and has fathered a child, but he can still be a useful minion of God.  Greene shows that even those with weaknesses and past sins can still achieve glory in life.  Through the eyes of others, Greene shows how this self-loathing priest has done more than he could ever imagine.  Overall, this is a superb book and a fine addition to any reading list.  
 A masterpiece.  Unbelivable. Stylistically perfect. If you care about literature this is a book you should not miss out on 
 As others have stated, this is a helpful book for improving line-level writing.  This is not a general book on fiction writing and does not cover the usual topics, nor is it intended to.  This leaves more room for what it does cover: editing.    Since others have mentioned Renni Browne's editing service (called "The Editorial Department"), some caveats are in order.  The editing provided by this organization is not done by Browne or by King or by another other professional editor.  It is done by writers to whom Browne has given a quicky training class.  Renni herself seemed okay when I talked to her, but her people provided the most skimpy and general critiques I have ever received, and they were largely useless.  (And it cost five times more than I paid to various published writers whom I hired to critique my manuscripts, whose critiques were professional and valuable.)    Read the book instead 
 Fantastic duo performance. What seems like a odd match at first is really a match made in heaven. These two greats are perfect together 
 This book (one in a series where Krishnamurti goes deeply into several topics critical to mankind) will mainly be of intrest to people who are already familiar with Krishnamurti's basic philosophy/teachings. Krishnamurti uses many words with specific definitions (specific to himself & used throughout his works) that people might not understand if they don't go deeply into particular subjects. This book helps clarify & define several of them. In a nut-shell, Krishnamurti states "How can anyone find God (the unknown) through the known? All one will find is their own thought's known projections. So to know God (if that's possible), one cannot approach God through the known; through knowledge." This is part of a larger thought of his, which is: don't believe in anything. Don't believe at all. If something comes to you as-is, on its own, fine. But any seeking...through prayer, thought, traditional types of yoga/meditation, or whatnot, is futile, as you will only find the known. Only when one stops seeking, is it possible for God, Truth, Reality, Enlightenment...call it what you will...to come to one. This, like all of Krishnamurti's works, will be of intrest to existentialists, as he states somewhere/everywhere (I've read so many of his works I've forgotten where!): "Truth is a pathless land. You can't follow another to get there, and none can follow you once you've reached it yourself." If you dig Krishnamurti, get it 
 "The Dream of the Blue Turtles" (1985) was Sting's first solo recording after the demise of The Police. Collaborating with jazz artists such as Branford Marsalis, the singer-songwriter crafted an album of refreshing eclecticism and first-rate musicianship. The pretentious "Russians" is the only weak spot, but the remaining tracks are excellent -- notably "Shadows in the Rain" and "Children's Crusade. 
 It is so great to see the old standards come to market.  They just don't make good movies like this anymore.  Pure acting and not so much background stuff and not all action.  Real 5 star stuff 
 I love this book. Even though I have read it thouroghly, I still keep looking back for makeup advice. What I liked was that she really emphasized lots of good points, and making sure that we know that beauty is really only skin deep. Her tips were useful, the book was loaded with lots of styles to try out-even hair. And what I liked was that she didn't make any references to buy her products-she was making this book for the girls to enjoy, not to be advertised to. I would suggest this book for girls about 11-19, although anyone could enjoy it 
 I bought this for my 5 year old grandson, he is VERY active and I thought it would be a good way to burn up some of that extra energy!  Not only does he love it, but so does his 2 year old sister.  My daughter tells me that they both dance and dance, until they fall down laughing.  This was certainly a good buy 
 An enjoyable book which offers a good insight into the LBO business and the workings of Wall Street during the 1980s. There are some serious amounts of money involved and some very amusing characters - It almost reads like a comedy when detailing the exploits and excess of the chairman of RJR Nabisco with his fleet of company jets and "superstar" cronies.   Essentially, it reads like a thriller and although a little confusing (and perhaps too detailed on the history / background in parts), it is nevertheless a solid, enjoyable read and a 'keeper'. Recommended  
 I don't understand why this collector's edition hasn't come out with a true 16x9 WS 
 May I point out to reviewer Jon Hunt and any who are influenced by his review...Bearing in mind the length of the history of Britain compared to the lenght of the history of America, as far as English is concerned, it is hardly surprising that one would find the parts of the book specifically relating to American English near the end! I would have thought the whole history of the language was relevant whether it occured in this land or elsewhere 
 Most of the recordings of Porter's songs on this CD were cut in the 1950s and 1960s, and are vintage Capitol of that time.  That means that most of them have jazzy background music that almost always accentuates rather than detracts from the songs.  Whether or not one likes all the recordings, one thing comes across clearly: the singers are having a great time.  Their sheer fun really is infectious.  For my money, the single best number on the CD is Peggy Lee's "Always True to You in My Fashion."  Dinah Shore sings an incredibly sultry "It's All Right with Me," and Louis Prima and Keely Smith are fantastic in their own idiosyncratic version of "I've Got You Under My Skin."  Tony Bennett's classic version of "Anything Goes" will never grow old, and it's wonderful to have it included on this CD.  Judy Garland's "I Happen to Like New York City" is awful, as is Dean Martin's "True Love," but they're awful in the wonderfully kitschy way of 1950s overdone tunes.  Trudy Richards can't be beat when it comes to "Let's Do It," and the great Nancy Wilson croons a "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" that you won't forget.   Like an earlier reviewer, I was surprised that Sinatra isn't one of the featured artists here.  But there are plenty of other places to hear him sing Porter.  All in all, a great CD.  It'll put you in a different place and time.  
 Oh those gay 70's days in San Francisco when "cherez la femme" ruled the original Pink Village. Armistead Maupin revealed a zany twist of relationships in the most liberal city during its most liberal times long before the late 90's tech boom. Tales of the City depicted just how much ahead of the times San Francisco has always been 
 Peter Bowerman has done is again!  After reading his first book, The Well Fed Writer, I started a freelance writing business and became the breadwinner in my family.  Just when I was starting to think about branching out into different markets, HE DOES IT AGAIN!    Bowerman answers all the questions I never knew I always needed answered.  I highly reccommend not only this book, but thr first one as well.  Using the two together is the best way to get results FAST!      I want to tell you a quick (and completely true, I promise) story about how much I love Bowerman's books....  When I bought the Well Fed Writer, I read it five times before getting started and did the same thing with Back for Seconds.  I think this man is quite possibly the most useful resource for writers who want to make serious money in the writing business.    Anyway, a few months ago I went on a trip and I took my treasured books with me.  One thing leading to another, my luggage was lost and along with it, my books.  I was devastated.  So I bought them both again.  I am pretty frugal, so for me to buy a book more than once (especially when I've already read it so many times...), well, lets just say it's a big deal.    Now, I just finished moving, and when I started to unpack, I got the urge to read Back for Seconds again (great book... very useful..), but I could not locate it.  I thought it would be silly to buy the book again, but I really wanted to read it.  I figured that by the time I had a new one shipped, I would probably have found the old one already.  But you see.... I REALLY WANTED TO READ MY BOOK.    Now, this is how much I love this book...   I went online and bought both the Well Fed Writer and Back for Seconds as e-books from Bowerman's site.  Two days later I found my books, but that is okay by me.  Now when I travel, I can read it on my laptop without fear of losing my favorite writing books.  
 This was the first Ellis Peters novel I have read.  I understand that she continues the Cadfael series, and I would be interested in checking out the other books.  Brother Cadfael was an interesting mix of the world (due to  his previous life outside of the ministry-as a soldier) and the Spirit.  He  was very smart, but was not my favorite detective.  The thing I loved the  most about this book was Ellis Peters' descriptions about people and  situations.  The description that struck me the hardest was the one of the  woman's body Brother Cadfael found in the beginning.  I'd like to conclude  by saying that the historical information was invaluable as well.  A  mystery with a historical context is something I thoroughly enjoy 
 I discovered the White Company while reading Louis Lamour's "Education of A Wondering Man".  It was included in Lamours reading list from the 1930's.  On a lark i checked it out.  What a gem this book is!  I simply could not put it down.  The language, the characters, the history and the humor simply crackle off the pages.  If you have a son, here's your next gift 
 After I read chapter 3, "Monsieur le mairie," I knew that I not only liked this book, but loved it. This is a book of very warm, real portraits of French people in a small community and of vivid and pleasant images of a village and the countryside around it. The book centers on the village of Les Arques in the valley of the Lot River, which lies below the better known valley of the Dordogne, and it is loosely center around a restaurant, La Recreation, and the dedicated proprietors, Jacques and Noelle. Although I am not interested in restaurants and cooking, I found myself fascinated. Not only did I learn about the life of a small, yet dedicated restaurant, but about the farmer who lovingly came to grow produce for it. And about the many other relationships of Les Arques that spell the familial essence of being French. I learned about the trials of producing truffles, of raising ducks for foie gras, and of eking out a living in rural France. Yet it is a happy book, a joyous book, a real book, and a loving book. When the author returned to America, it was almost as difficult for me to say good-bye to Les Arques 
 If the credentials of the authors didn't convince of the quality of this book, I'm not sure I can.  I will say that I have read and re-read the book several times, and that it's a vital resource in our laboratory.  From the various issues of scaling to what analyses do what, this book is an excellent resource of theories and technologies involved in Landscape Ecology 
 Penelope Wilcock's The Hawk And The Dove is a trilogy of novels under one cover. Poignant, moving, rich with imagery and emotion, each of these engaging stories drawn from the brothers of St. Alcuin are presented as being told to a 15-year-old girl by her mother. Tom must decide between the  beautiful girl he loves and the call of God upon his life. Francis finds  that never again will he need to hide his personal paint beneath a jest.  When James cannot escape the truth of who he is, he pours out his grief to  God and rises a newborn child of grace. Although these stories are set in  an earlier century, modern readers will easily identify with each charter  in Wilcock's timeless human dramas of people learning to love and serve one  another while growing in their understanding of a tender and compassionate  God. Highly recommended reading 
 Even if you missed Legally Blonde, this comedic outing is just for fun and can stand alone. Elle Woods takes on the Washington insiders and keeps coming out on top through a combination of sheer luck, connections, and by blondely working out the problems based on her earlier sorority experience.  Somewhat dippy, but fun anyway. I thought the grand speech didn't really have what it took to bring about the happy ending, but hey, you have to suspend your brain a bit with this story anyway.   Enjoy it for what it is and don't expect great literature, just a fun little film.  The DVD included some interesting interviews with the actors and director. 
 This is an excellence book, it give the reader a very good understanding of how to obtain competitive advantage through the manufacturing function.And how the marketing and the manufacturing functions should work togethe

 In "On the waterfront," perhaps the saddest point of the film is where Fr. Barry eulogizes K. O. Duggan, killed off by the mob. But Marc Levinson has located a larger villain, the real force that killed off so many longshoremen's careers: the standardized shipping container. While a highly trained crane operator working today's docks earns $120,000 a year, their numbers are few and few of them are former longshoremen or sons of longshoremen. And cargo handling costs have dropped over 90%. Yet this is only the start. The shipping container reduced  spoilage, theft, insurance costs, delays, and the entire cost of going global.  Levinson's well-researched treatment of a seemingly pedestrian subject works effectively to show that the world is not flat. The original dust cover of Friedman's best-selling book shows a tall-masted ship going over the edge of the 'flat' earth, confirming flat earth society members' discarded beliefs but distorting and mischaracterizing globalization. Levinson's rich, detailed, data-filled work shows the stark difference between Levinson's work with The Economist and Friedman's with The New York Times. Levinson uses a thorough, comprehensive economic and technological analysis, while Friedman flies around the world with a consistent "gee whiz" attitude of surprise. Levinson traces multitudes of disparate events and finds common links where Friedman finds common links and illustrates them with cursory events. Levinson is an economist; Friedman is a journalist. Friedman mixes metaphors and hyperbole; Levinson mixes in a wide range of colorful characters and challenges. Levinson is an editor; Friedman needs one. People who want to understand the recent history, impetus and infrastructure of globalization need to read "The box."  Fifty years ago, maverick southern trucker Malcolm McLean devised a method for a quantum leap forward in the handling of cargo in transit. At that time, the process of loading and offloading of ships had not changed much in hundreds of years. Loose cargo, irregular, unpredictable and back-breaking work, light-fingered workers, corrupt stevedores, poor management, and mob-controlled unions were the order of the day and most orders changed on a daily basis. The workers probably suffered the most, but the hidden impact on global trade was severe as well. Some small and expensive products  -- whiskey, watches -- could not be shipped reliably and safely when subject to massive pilferage. While containers started as a domestic solution, their global use worked miracles in reducing the costs of getting products thousands of miles, and not just on what came to be huge, fast new ocean sailing ships. Railroads and truckers participated in this transformation. Markets opened up. Ports like Felixstowe (England) and Singapore emerged rapidly, displacing older, intransigent ports. Military shipping in containers from America's west coast for the Vietnam War made return trips with stop offs in Japan a cheap, added source of shipping revenue. Cheap-to-ship Japanese products flooded America. Ports sprung up where investors and governments were willing to build cranes, re-build docks and dredge canals. Corrupt, inefficient labor could be bypassed and eliminated, no matter how powerful the union or onerous the contracts. Free trade multiplied.  Sometimes global revolutionary change is not sexy. It's not even computer-driven. Maybe the computer chip spurred globalization, but it was the container ship that made it possible. The idea is to make trade fast, reliable and inexpensive, not just to make the world flat. Containers are like computer chips; they hold lots of stuff in a well-organized fashion. Without the containers, the global transportation network would be running much slower and more costly than it does today. Levinson catalogs a history of shadowy billionaires, entrepreneurs, and a few enlightened governments (the demise of London and New York City ports under much less enlightened leaders is especially painful) that produced a true global revolution. This book is a greater tale of globalization.  I only wish Levinson had included some photographs and more drawings. Some of the technical and industry-specific language can be dry and hard to visualize through verbal descriptions alone 
 Lee views the life of World War I hero Alvin York through the lens of a changing society.  York represented, according to Lee, the values of 19th century rural American-simplicity, honesty, hard work, Protestantism, and Anglo-American heritage-in an industrializing society.  His defeat of German machine gunners came to symbolize "man over machine" as well.  York moved from a pacifist, noninterventionist position to accept America's role as a major world power.  This acceptance was based on a religious vision of the US as a defender against evil in the world.  Lee's book is well written, moves fast, and well argued.  He succeeds in demonstrating that an indivdual life can be used to understand American history in the early 20th century 
 Mr. Revere and I is about Paul Revere told from the perspective of his horse Sherry. Sherry goes through three owners, the last her favorite. She expierences what it is like to be the horse of a Patriot. We enjoyed reading this book because it includes humor, facts, and sometimes even suspense. That is why we recommend this book to other kids 
 I am not a big Tesla fan but this is a great album. I think what hurt them is that they were categorized with the all the goofy hair metal bands but they were more in the vein of your classic 70's style rock and roll band. This live album, along with the accoustic format, helped to distinguish Tesla from the hair metal bands of the era.   Tesla did not do much after this cd so this acts as an excellent greatest hits compilation as well.  Besides their own work, the covers are good and interesting selections. They do not just play "Truckin", rather they segue into it. "Lodi" is done very well and then the song that essentially launched the cd, as well as the band, is "Signs". They take this marginal 60's era protest song and put their stamp of it. It still maintains a protest aura to it but the accoustic treatment makes it grittier and it rocks out harder. Tesla made the song their own!  As far as the accoustic format, the song "Love Song" showcases the musicianship of the band. I like how they could not resist plugging in for the guitar solo.  Overall, you do not have to be a fan of this band to enjoy this cd. If you like any classic rock Led Zep, CCR, Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, Aerosmith etc. then you will like this.  Like I said, I am not a big fan but b/c of this cd, I would see them live any day! 
 Thank you for having this DVD's I have been trying to find them. The TV used to show this show once a year, but since all the new [...] has come out they dont want to show the old movies. This is one of best love stories that has ever been created, next to gone with the wind, which I have yet to purchase. The condition of the DVD's is great,it took me a while to operate my new Bose system, but once I figured it out, it was like being there again. I hope to purchase more DVD's in the future and this is where I will look first, thanks again 
 Joyce Appleby's concise "Thomas Jefferson" is a well-written book mainly about Thomas Jefferson's presidency. Appleby understands Jefferson's place in history and gets the story right. I also recommend R.B. Bernstein's concise "Thomas Jefferson," which covers Jefferson's entire life better. But for a book on the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, Appleby's book is a fine choice 
 My purchase and interest in this book started when I had to do a research paper on Heinrich Himmler's psychobiographical background. There is an extremely well written chapter in this book which is based primarily off of the work of Angress and Smith who were the first to ever write on Himmler's teenage diaries. What you find about Heinrich Himmler, I will leave for you, the reader, to discover as it will definitely throw you for a loop that no fiction book could even do. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history beyond just dates, names and statistics. This is a great beginner's book for those who have always wondered what psychological factors played into history. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because Loewenberg made a few comments on sexuality that are broad and unfounded 
 A working-class family consisting of a daughter, mother, and grandmother have lost their house in a fire.  Although the community banded together to help them assemble the essentials, they have been saving their change in a jar for a year to furnish their bare living room in their apartment.  They dream of the perfect chair and, when the jar is finally full, like Goldilocks (as Grandma said), they go searching for and find a chair that's just right.  This book focuses on three generations of women who are self-reliant.  The illustrations are bright and colorful and each spread is embellished with a floral or geometric border.  I especially love the illustration of the community showing people of many hues coming out of their houses and lining up to deliver household items to the family in need 
 I'm a very happy customer.  The book was exactly as promised and in great shape 
 When Professor von Hardwigg discovers an ancient parchment suggesting a journey to the center of the Earth is possible, he wastes no time dragooning his dubious nephew and ward, Harry, into an expedition, first to Iceland, and then into the Earth.  Harry, a young man, sees no good that can come of this expedition, but dutifully agrees.    So begins one of the most beloved classics of science fiction ever published, Jules Verne's "A Journey to the Center of the Earth".  I'm hardly a Verne expert, but I've read many of his other classics.  "Journey" is unique among his work.  It's one of the few books to feature a first person narrator in the form of Harry.  Moreover, unlike his other books, "Journey" is less grounded in science and more interested in the fantastic.  Verne, through his various characters, slyly implores his readers' indulgence, reminding us that there is plenty about the center of the world we don't know.    Verne was an author who dealt in archetypal characters.  From "20,000 Leagues Under the Seas" on, Verne generally concentrated on three types of characters as his protagonists:  the brilliant and calm professor; the professor's loyal apprentice, and; the non-scientific, cantankerous, pragmatic, but steadfast man of action.  Here, Verne mixes and matches these traits, making for a more interesting cast.  Hardwigg is a brilliant scientist, but he's also a ball of barely restrained emotion and energy, demanding his fellow travelers press on, perhaps beyond all reason.  The man of action, the Icelandic Hans, is loyal, but by no means cantankerous.  He simply does what must be done, and is unsteady in his loyalty.  Finally, Harry, rather than the unquestioning apprentice, is quite skeptical of this expedition.  Hardly steadfast, he proves to be quite cowardly and panics at inopportune times.  Thus, with these interesting characters in the mix, the plot of the novel proves frequently unpredictable.  While the premise is fantastic, the action of the novel is far less concerned with monsters that might be found at the center of the earth than the more realistic, albeit more mundane, threats of natural disaster.  Rather than being chased by dinosaurs or hidden cave-men, our heroes must deal with being lost, the threat of starvation, underground lakes, exhaustion, and exposure.  Naturally, just as all hope seems lost for our heroes, fortune takes a hand.  Obviously, if Harry is narrating, they probably get out okay.  Still, there are some moments of true white knuckle tension, as Harry is lost in the caverns, or the trio finds itself on a raft with only a piece of jerky as their food-supply.    Wisely, Verne lets the scientific explanations he used as the basis of his other novels go here.  He's less interested in giving his reader an education in the latest discovery, and concentrates instead on a great rip-roaring read.  Admittedly, the conventions of Victorian-era fiction don't always allow the book to rip or roar.  The first third of the book is actually dedicated to getting Harry and the Professor to Iceland and recruiting an expedition.  It's more of a travelogue than an adventure tale, which makes the book more realistic, although not consistently exciting.  Once our heroes are underground, however, the book takes off.    In the grand scheme of things, "A Journey to the Center of the Earth" is probably not my favorite Verne book.  It lacks a remarkable character, like Captain Nemo.  It also lacks some of the sharper satire Verne brought to his other books, like "From the Earth to the Moon."  It doesn't quite have the pacing of "Around the World in 80 Days."  Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and charming read, and certainly has earned its place among the classics.    
 Nacy Silverton knows her stuff....and knows how to inspire......it got me baking with passion again 
 Fascinating!  A brilliantly written insight into all those things you always wondered about the business of the NFL.  Already an accomplished writer, Yost's Wall Street pedigree shows through in every page.  No spin.  Just how it should be.  Highly recommend, and a must read for anyone interested in the sports business 
 I picked up a number of these bible code books after reading "Conquest of Paradise", a fictional account of the end times and the prophecies from the Bible.  This is far superior to any other that I've read.  "Cracking the Bible Code" is concise and elegantly written.  You won't find the hype associated with other books, just facts and rational reasoning. This is a must read for both Bible scholar and skeptic alike. It provides tremendous amounts of research, great discussion, relevant stories, and ample references.  It's far better than the original "Bible Code" by Michael Drosnin.  I suggest readers avoid that and pick up "Conquest of Paradise" and "Cracking the Bible Code" instead.  Both books will have a profound effect on your worldview long after you've read them 
 This is a story about Maggie Nesbitt, a woman who is pregnant, but sadly, the baby isn't her husband's, who is a local news anchor in Los Angeles. Then one day she sees on the news a story about her husband's wife, being murdered and the body dumped behind a local bar. Maggie immediately knows it must be the twin she thought had died in infancy. After a quick investigation she learns her sister has a child named Jasmine and is divorced from a horrible man. To keep Jasmine from having to go with her father and to keep her own unborn child, Maggie takes over her dead twin's life. However, unknown to her the man that murdered her twin now thinks he killed the wrong woman and now he's after Maggie.  That is the plot in a nutshell. Of course I haven't begun to describe the characters, Maggie's one true friend, who will miss her. Maggie's new friends. How she has to fool a little girl into believing she is her mother. How the bad guy goes off the deep end when he finds out the woman he killed is still walking, talking, breathing. I really liked this book, it is fast-paced, full of people I cared about and the story was divine. Who wouldn't want a chance to step into another life. Maggie gets that chance. Her sister had a beautiful child, a Porsche and scads of money in the bank. Oh, I almost forgot, there is the small matter of that psycho killer who wants her dead 
 Easy to read, understand. Good reference book for basic buliding blocks in  RF circuit design. The book only has solved example problems and is not very helpful for practise 
 I had this on VHS for a while so it took me a little while longer to purchase the DVD.  Thank goodness I did because it puts the VHS version to shame.  The special features are incredible; especially the multiple camera angles for "Baba O' Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again," the interview with Daltrey, and the solo Entwistle bass tracks for the two songs mentioned above.  The interview with Jeff Stein is also excellent along with the comparisons of the old picture and sound versus the new. The movie itself looks and sounds so much better.  Jeff Stein's commentary is also very good.  The best live performances in this movie for me are "Baba O'Riley (best live version)," "Won't Get Fooled Again (also best live version)," "Roadrunner," "A Quick One While He's Away," "Young Man Blues," "Sparks," "My Generation (from Monterey Pop)," and "Barbara Ann." The Woodstock performances of "Pinball Wizard" and "See Me Feel Me" have great sound but bad camera angles.  Other highlights include watching the band record "Who Are You" in the studio, the interview footage with all four members together, the "Happy Jack" and "Cobwebs and Strange" segments, John shooting Daltrey's gold records, all of Pete's interviews, all of Keith's interviews, "I Can't Explain" on Shindig, "My Generation" on the Smothers Brothers show, and whatever else I haven't mentioned.  I could go on for hours.  This is such an amazing movie and my only complaint is that it could have even been an hour or two longer so it could include more footage of the Who live or doing interviews.  However, it is still the best Who DVD available and rightly so.  I hope there will be another Who DVD soon with more classic live footage of the original Who.  If you are a Who fan, this is the DVD to get first.  After that, buy "Royal Albert Hall" and "Isle of Wight." 
 i have over 50 boxed sets, and by far this is the best packaged i have ever seen.  i have shown all my friends and all were very impressed.  it comes in a conventional sized women's hat box with a carrying rope.  as you remove the lid and open the box, the 4 cd's are in individual cardboard cd cases centered in the box with black felt cardboard material filling the round box.  in the round lid are the listings of songs and artists, and on top of the 4 cd's is a 200 page booklet that has pertinent information about each artist and song.  there are pictures of almost every artist, as well as pictures of the original 45 labels.  the bios of the artists and songs are informational and entertaining.  each cd has many familiar songs along with many never heard before, including songs by big name artists that were released before they became successful.  2 examples: a song by cher, written by sonny, and released 2 years before they released "i got you babe."  a pop song released in 1964 by dolly parton before she became a country star.  there are 120 songs on the 4 cd's with most being ignored totally by radio.  there was only one song out of the 120 that i absolutely hated; the rest were not only listenable, but in most cases very good to excellent.  this is a definitely worthwhile purchase if you're into the sixties music. 
 A mystery, a psychological drama, a fantastic book about families and feelings. Every word rings true to something you have felt. I hate to read soapy tales but the emotions in this book are touchingly real as they carry you along. The climax of the story comes somewhere a little before the end of the story but the end is even more satisfying and uplifting.  The only mystery is why this book is not a best seller?  You love mysteries, this one is quite different but will match the best ones you have read. Even if you dont read mysteries, this is one book I can recommend highly for a satisfying read. 
 For those of us who keep going back again and again to read the novels of Ross Macdonald, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Ernest Hemingway and Peter Matthiessen, this is without question one of the greatest works of that group.    Once Ross Macdonald (Ken Millar) broke through with the Galton Case,  every novel from then on formed one of the great canons of American literature.  The N.Y. Times Book Review had The Underground Man as its front page review in 1970. Well-deserved recongnition for a writer at his zenith. What Conan Doyle was to London in its era, so is Ross Macdonald to  California in its era.  A great writer on the edge of a culture. The Chill stands with the Zebra-Striped Hearse and The Underground Man alongside The Long Goodbye and The Big Sleep as American writing at its very best. To be an American (and a Californian) is to read these books. So subtle, so psychological, so empathetic, so hard. Modern noir --- the epitome of great craftsmanship. At the top of 5 stars.  The very top.  One of the proud novels on the Knopf list 
 I absolutely loved this book, and Buzzy's ideas and methods presented in this book helped me come up with some profitable methods of my own, although the book would be best described as an autobiography. It contains some strong language, but if you are a grown-up this shouldn't be a problem. It is an interesting and funny read dealing with various issues in the life of a trader. I wish I could give this book 10 stars 
 All That Remains was a hard book to put down. Patricia Cornwell writes so well that it's difficult to find a place to take a break when reading her novels. She is an expert at striking a balance between detail and the flow of the story. As a reader (and a writer), I believe I can learn much from her. The fact that she was a crime reporter for some years and a medical examiner, as well, adds authenticity to her stories. I'm looking forward to her next book, Predator, due out on October 25, 2005.  When the daughter of powerful Washington politician, National Drug Policy Director, Pat Harvey, and boyfriend turn up missing, the services of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Richmond, New Jersey, are called upon once again. Four other couples have disappeared in similar fashion and have eventually been found murdered, all within a fifty-five mile radius of Williamsburg (Virginia). Scarpetta is called to a local rest area where Ms. Harvey's daughter, Deborah's, jeep has been found. When last seen, the couple was headed to the Harvey beach home in said jeep. A new investigation begins. Investigators, powerful politicians, and covert operations agents speculate as to whether or not this case is associated with Harvey's job or is it, perhaps, the fifth in a series of couple murders. As is often the case in Cornwell's stories, it becomes a question of who knows what and what is the real truth behind events and motives.  The murders have been particularly gruesome, and when found, all that remains of the young people are some bones and clothing, along with a jack of hearts playing card. Also, in each case, the victims' shoes and socks cannot be found. Scarpetta and Richmond homicide detective, Pete Marino, follow various leads, spend considerable time speculating on the who and why of the murders, while investigative reporter, Abby Turnbull, seems to be terrified about something (Marino doesn't trust her). Ex-lover, Mark James, makes an appearance and temporarily heats up the personal side of Scarpetta's life again. In the end the killer is found and the murders solved, but at tremendous cost to the Harvey family and to others. An excellent read.   Carolyn Rowe Hill 
 After releasing his last album, "Lights Out" in 2002, Lil Wayne took a year off the solo scene by releasing another Hot Boys album, "Let Em Burn."  Even though most of the album was recorded in the past years, that album sadly will probably be the last the group will ever release.  Anyway Lil Wayne comes back on the scene in 2004 with his 4th solo album, "Tha Carter."  1. Walk In - 4.5/5  2. Go DJ - 4.5/5  3. This is the Carter (Featuring Mannie Fresh) - 5/5  4.

I don't know what he changed in his style but he definitely evolved into an amazing talent with this release.  DEFINITELY check this out, it's an incredible album 
 A bit more info on the program. It does exist. It is free. You send in your camera or, if in a big city, take it in to a repair center for the free replacement. It does not matter if your camera is out of warranty. The replacement program exists in other countries as well (at least the UK and Canada). JVC is standing behind their product and you really have to respect them for that. (This problem of the bad CCD occurs in a dozen or more models manufacturred during 2002 and 2003.)  The number to call for more info in the USA is (800) 858-6442. In Canada it's (800) 964-2650.  Oh, btw: the camera, aside from breaking, has been excellent. Low light shooting is so important during family events, I can't see why other manufacturers don't follow JVC's lead and improve notoriously bad performance. Image stabilization does work well for landscape sorts of shots, not so well for moving targets like your two year old. Sound could be better, but this is an excellent product at the price point.  Good luck,  Fran 
 Excellent!  I passed all the practice tests with a scaled score of 60 (50 is required) and was extremely pleased to pass the actual exam with a 65.  Well worth purchasing.  In contrast to some other reviews, the CLEP I took had several questions on the terminology, so I found the terminology review extremely beneficial 
 I havent gotten these before but they look like a good pair of binoculars.I suggest adding these to your wish list if you like the outdoors 
 The music is excellent . Flows well  Better than the movie score 
 I was expecting a real blockbuster ending to this series, and I was a bit disappointed. I thought the killers would turn out to be people way more involved in the series, and I was disappointed that they were really fringe characters. I felt let down by that.  Still, you can't go wrong with a Mariah Stewart book. She's one of the best out there when it comes to keeping you rivited. 
 THE SAVAGE GOD is a masterpiece despite the fact that it reeks of the english department. And despite the fact that Clive James was right when he accused Alvarez of being guilty of "full frontal solemnity". And like James also said, Alvarez was ludicrously portentious to claim that modern life is far more suicide-provoking than ancient life. The world has *always* been a hellhole.  One of my favorite quotes concerns Alvarez's reaction after waking up from an attempted barbiturate overdose: "My weakened body, my thin breath, the slightest flicker of emotion filled me with distaste. I wanted only to be left to myself. Then, as the months passed, I began gradually to stir into another style of life, less theoretical, less optimistic, less vulnerable. I was ready for an insentient middle age."  A lot of people are ready to be insentient from day one. And I really can't blame them. Here's my favorite quote: "The cult of the Inconnue seemed to attract young people between the two world wars in much the same way as drugs call them now: to opt out before they start, to give up a struggle that frightens them in a world they find distasteful, and to slide away into a deep inner dream."  
 I am a tremendous fan of James Lee Burke, first and foremost. I also found this book to continue to earn my complete respect. There will come a day, when Burke will be considered among the true classical writers who's talent cannot be contained nor limited by definition ie: mystery, suspense, action thriller...so i guess you could say that my experience reading Crusader's Cross is the same for every Dave Robicheaux novel published and perhaps, not published. It would be incredibly difficult for any author to best Burke on every facit of his talents 
 Keep the Lights Burning, Abbie is a well-written piece of historical fiction based on Abbie Burgess' own accounts and other historical sources.  This information is provided in the note by the authors at the beginning of the book.  All incidences appear to be very representative of the life of the time depicted.  Abbie's character is developed well.  The reader is able to see that Abbie is a strong young girl who does not want to let her family, especially her father, down.  She faces the conflict of person vs. self and also person vs. nature is evident in the book.  The theme evident in the book is bravery and strength.  Abbie had to be brave to keep the lights lit.  She needed the strength to overcome her fears and to live up to her father's expectations.  The illustrations were beautiful watercolors that set the mood of the story 
 I love Nichole.  I've seen her in concert three times.  She writes her own music and plays her own piano.  Her songs are question driven.  She has a degree in Psychology and it really shines through with some of her lingo and perspectives.  This is great for mental AND spiritual health.  If you are into self-awareness and you are a Christian then this CD is right up your alley 
 Nice tip and easy to read. Great price 
 Denis Johnson is one of our most talented writers and poets today.  He may be underrated, and younger writers like Rick Moody overrated.  Johnson is able to get to the soul of matters, to the loneliness that inflicts his protagonists, to an almost Pynchonesque far-fetched series of events that bring novelty to this work--and all using readable prose, evocative images, and unfailing dailogue that strike me, at least, as authentic.  Goobers.  This man's for us and generations to come 
 After some horrifying experiences looking at educational dvds that didn't deliver, this DVD was a very welcome suprise. It is very tastefully done, has attractive models, and is very educational without being tacky or pornographic.  I can't fault anything about this, and would certainly purchase another in the series. This is the type of DVD that I wish I had as a teenager curious about sex, but is also very relevant as a thirty-something year old. The positions include both regular and advanced, and have tips on how to increase stimulation and cautions to watch for. It has three main series - male superior, female superior, and a beautiful set of positions using seated positions on a kitchen chair. The best thing about this DVD is that opposed to other DVDs that you watch once, get the ideas and then have to pass along to a friend, this is one that you can keep as something tasteful to play in the background of the bedroom 
 jessi gets an incredible role in her ballet schools performance and can't wait to start rehersing. but somthing fishy is going on first jessi's toe shoes are stolen, next she finds hate-notes tucked into her sneaker, but then when jessi gets into a real accident, the bsc is on the case! they also do this neat pet show, and when the kids start to get a little too competitive,jessi comes up with a plan so every body wins! i think it's hilarious when karen 'dresses up' her pet mouse, and the only thing i did'nt like, was that ann used 3rd year ballet moves at jessi's lessons.but she used 6th year moves at the performance, which was better 
 I've enjoyed every Naylor book, and this was no exception. The story is cute, fun, and light. The characters were engaging, and I liked having the story move to Australia for a change. While there's nothing earthshatteringly different about the story - girl, boy, job - it's wonderful. I'd highly recommend this book and any other Naylor book for anyone looking for a fun, fast read. 
 This book illustrates some of the miracles of the quran. It shows that it is impossible for a man named Muhammed(Pbuh) who lived in the dessert and was unable to read and write could ever know about the science of the Oceans, Embryo, Skies, Mountains, Rain and water. The composition of the human and much more. A must read 
 This film has the potential of becoming a classic. A convict is sent back in time to find out about the virus that eliminated the majority of mankind.  Bruce Willis offers as a magnificent perfomance while tyhe directing and photography are great too.  The plot has enough twists and an unexpecting ending. All in all a film that you will enjoy 
 My daughter ( who is 2 1/2) and I found this book at the library and loved it so we bought it for a birthday present for one of her play group friends.  The mother wrote me the very day and expressed how much she and her daughter loved it too.  The companion book Welcome Baby! is awesome.  Toddlers and babies love the pictures and rhymes about going about town in their stroller, color songs, body parts, etc..  I will be getting Good for You! for my daughter as well 
 Ram Charan makes a complex topic easy to understand. This book can be "speed read" in 45 minutes and it doesn't make you feel dizzy. Ram Charan is a true thought leader and an inspiration 
 I liked this book but found the beginning to be a little slow.  Keep reading though because the end makes up for the beginning.  I will definitely read her other book 
 This is one of the books mentioned in the book called The Well Read Witch.  I am currently in the process of buying all of the books mentioned.  This book should definetely be on any Witches list of must-reads!  After all, the title alone evokes poetry.  And the book delivers.  It is a book about how to explore your dreams, and it tells you how to figure out what your dreams mean to you, not what somebody else thinks they mean.  Also looks at dream magick 
 I wish I had read this book prior to our traveling to Australia. It would have added more value to our already wonderful trip 
 This is an awesome, awesome, cd. I am a HUGE fan of Danu, and have listened to all their cd's, but this is by far their best. If you like celtic music, you've got to get this one!!! Ciarin has a beautiful voice and all the lads are so, so, talented. If you have a chance, go to one of their concerts while they are on tour through the US!!! I got to go to one a few months back and it was just amazing. I met them all and they are really nice!!! Don't miss this great cd 
 Se puede escuchar porque Judas Priest es de los creadores del Heavy Metal, la potencia de la msica se escucha a lo largo de todo el cd, sin necesidad de ser rpidos y ruidosos, la voz de Rob H. con potencia sin perder calidad. Para los conocedores de Judas Priest despus de su xito British Steel, valel la pena escucharlo para conocer los principios e la banda y notar que la calidad se impuso desde el principi 
 My 10 year old son and I read this book and we both loved it. Three children of the elite class who have been protected all their lives venture out into the "real world" one day and the adventure starts there. They endure ALOT of hardship along the way but clearly learn something about themselves from each experience. I thought this book helped my son to question the "norms" of the world and reflect on some complex social issues like poverty and crime.   
 At the time of Jade's debut, Jade To The Max, SWV was just hitting the scene as well.  The trio are a lot more talented than their compitition, but fell off with some production issues.  The upbeat production of their singles, "Don't Walk Away" and "I Wanna Love You", can very well have you feeling alive all of a sudden.  Pleading for pleasure from lovers on "Give Me What I'm Missing" makes you think if there's something missing in your own relationship with this slow sexual groove.  "Looking For Mr. Do Right" is another slow grinder completes the overall appeal to this release.  Jade's debut calls on your emotional and listening pleasure by the moaning "I Want 'Cha Baby".  There are a few fillers on this, but the songs that grabs you, captivates you 
 Of all the gaming strategy books I have read, the Gamble to Win series has been the most helpful and informative to me.  These books take you more into the head of the professional gambler than any other.  And now, with Gamble to Win Roulette, the author apparently offers a strategy that reverses the casino's mathematical edge.  For my money, there is no better book out there 
 The author's amazing ability to capture the mind and thoughts of a young girl who has experienced tragedy and then rejection from her cold distant mother had me hooked from the very beginning.  The story is told through this girl's eyes as she finds herself alone in the world, desperately wanting love and forgiveness.  That this book won awards is a given...it's outstanding!  I was so impressed with many of the passages in this book, I wrote many of them down to enjoy again and again. The author weaves a story of God's many blessings without being "preachy" or "sweet and sappy" and gives you a history of those early pioneer days as if you were actually there living among the people.  I've put one of the passages on my wall that reads:  "The eagle soared not only by his own efforts, but by the strength of something else - by the strength of the wind and his willingness to bend to it."  Good words to live by.  I plan on reading more of Jane Kirkpatrick's works! Thanks for the good read Jane 
 I have just read this book and enjoyed it thoroughly. However, the title is somewhat misleading, as this is not a conventional biography. Other than a few chapters on her childhood and early education, the book is arranged in "theme" chapters, each focussing on a particular person or aspect of her life, illustrated, and heavily annotated, with letters and poems related to that theme.   I ended the book with more questions about her life than I had at the beginning. Many of them are barely addressed in the book, or just hinted at. Perhaps the book was intended for readers who are already very familiar with the biographical details.   Just as one example, the author mentions several times the eye problem that led to one of Emily's rare trips away from her home for treatement in Boston. I kept thinking that sooner or later some further details about this eye problem would be revealed, but there was never more than a few widely scattered sentences about it. Perhaps there isn't enough evidence to be able to conjecture as to the nature of the problem, but the author doesn't even seem to think it's an important enough detail to require a weighing of the evidence.   Likewise her mother's long illness, which played a role in Emily's withdrawal from the world, is mentioned but its nature is not discussed, other than a mention that she was paralyzed near the end of her life. Did she suffer a stroke? Was she lucid? Since Emily was her primary caregiver, it would seem that these details might bear on her own emotional state during the years of this illness and would warrant at least some speculation.   Even Emily's own final illness remains a mystery. We learn that her sister blamed it on the ill treatment received from her sister-in-law, and that her doctor attributed it to "nerves". However, from other hints, it seems to be a progessively debilitating illness. There is never as much as a paragraph in the entire book which speculates on the nature of this fatal illness or how much she might have been incapacitated between the first attack in June 1884 and her death in May 1885. "Nerves" seems to me to be an insufficient explanation for the death of the poet after an illness of eleven months. Are we sure the fainting spell was related to the final illness? Was she ill for the entire eleven months? For how long was she bedridden? The author doesn't even pose these questions.  In a book of 821 pages, there is no index entry for "illness". "Death [of ED]" has 7 widely scattered and brief entries, one of which is a footnote, one of which is a 13-sentence entry on how her death affected her brother, one of which is the text of her obituary and three of which describe her funeral(on pages 273, 575 and 667, to show how scattered they are). The seventh entry refers to her obituary, but seems to be a mistake, as I find no mention of her death or obituary on the page cited.   The book is especially good on the life of her brother Austin, and is also good on her father. Her mother and sister remain mysterious, probably because they were not much more exposed to public scrutiny than Emily herself was. It is obvious that her sister was nearly as much of a recluse as Emily, or at least was perceived as such by their neighbors.   In such a scattered book, there is inevitably a good deal of repetition of details. The three mentions of Emily's funeral cited above, for example, are mostly identical. Poems are also quoted in part or in their entirety multiple times.   There is an index of the poems and the pages on which they are discussed, which is useful for understanding the context of some of these, although the author acknowledges that the dating of the poems presents many problems.   There is a chronology at the beginning of the book, which really is the closest there is to a temporal ordering of the poet's life. I would suggest photocopying it and using it as a bookmark, because there is little chronological ordering, even within chapters at times. I found myself asking such things as, "Was this before her brother's marriage or after? Was her father still alive when this happened?" As a matter of fact, because I didn't have the chronology in front of me, I was surprised to realize, when I had almost finished the book, that Emily's father was still alive during the period of her most intense literary activity. After the early chapter devoted to her father's life, he is not often mentioned again, and I had somehow remained with the impression that he had died much earlier in her life.   Much as I enjoyed this book, I am left wanting another book to fill in the gaps. However, I learned enough about the partisanal nature of her biographers to be wary of choosing one. 
 As the Daughter of Sicilian Imigrants, I am naturally cautious of books that claim to be about a culture I know well and the land I think of as my second home.  This book is wonderful!  It has the rich history of Sicily  interspersed with Recipies that are as my own mother made them. The real  thing!  It is written with great fondness of the Island and of its people.   My father, of 88 enjoyed the book also.. saying that much of the history is  how he remembers it from tales told to him by my great and great great  grandparents.  My advise is .. If you love Sicily, the history culture and  food.. this book is a must have. It is a joyous work that Simeti has  crafted well! My thanks to her 
 This is an incredibly a well crafted film not to mention the incredibly compelling story 
 Benson writes about department stores' development as the new purveyors of mass culture and as the setting for a dynamic intersection of class and gender. She describes the encounters of saleswomen, managers, and customers in this retail environment between 1890 and 1940. Benson accomplishes this by combing through various journals and newspapers, and the results of this research are placed into perspective through comparison with other labor historians' work.  Although the juxtaposition of Benson's work with others' reveals some flaws, _Counter Cultures_ nevertheless presents an important and vivid picture of a service industry, a neglected area of labor histor 
 I enjoy reading reviews by folks who say Luna is 'interesting', or 'really good'.   The deal is this: Luna is, or were, one of the top 5 working bands in this here USA, period (along with Los Lobos, Wilco, and a couple others).   Don't even talk about their music, their lyrics, whatever. Just cool it. Buy their music. Stop writing. Don't even compliment Luna. Stop writing. Buy it. Listen. Share it.   Sidebar: cuz I know you are rapt by now: I first saw them opening for Lou (and don't ask 'Lou who?' yahoos) in '95, and they were transplendent. Ridiculously hypnotic. Dare I say, better than Lou? Mayhap I do, child, mayhap I do. 
 Many history books today portray Franklin D. Roosevelt as one of the greatest Presidents the United States has every had. He is credited with bring the country out of the depression and winning World War II.   This is not a friendly biography of President Roosevelt. The author, John T. Flynn, of "The Roosevelt Myth" presents another side of Roosevelt. Flynn was a journalist before, during, and after Roosevelt's presidency. He documents heavily how Roosevelt was not honorable, not truthful, and often did not make good decisions.   For example I was surprised to learn how aggressively Roosevelt had attacked Hoover for running up a deficit, while Roosevelt had been governor of New York and taking the state from a surplus of $150,000,000 to a deficit of $90,000,000. And then as president Roosevelt ran up a larger deficit in the first couple years than all the other presidents of the United States.   If you are interested in the time period of the Great Depression and World War II, this is a good book to read.  
 This record is a perfect example of how a sampler can be used as a instrument to make a album. Midnight In A Perfect world is my favorite track on this album and is probably one of the 25 best songs written or composed in the 20th century. If you see this record missing from someone's collection or know someone who hasn't listened to it , you need to step up and turn them on to it. 
 If you laugh at children falling down this is the book for you.  He may push it sometimes but isn't that what a good writer should do?  Knowing he is half Greek, so am I, I was hoping for a good egg cracking story or roasting lamb in your backyard.  Unfortunately there wasn't one.  Santaland was my favorite 
 "The Few: The American 'Knights of the Air' Who Risked Everything to Fight in the Battle of Britain" is Alex Kershaw's third foray into the Second World War non-fiction genre, and once again he has amply demonstrated his abilities to weave a story and capture the attention of the reader.    With his first book, "The Bedford Boys: One American Town's Ultimate D-Day Sacrifice", Kershaw had as his centerpiece the story of National Guardsmen from the little town of Bedford, VA who comprised Company A 116th Infantry Regiment (29th Division) who took part in the initial Omaha Beach landings on 6 June '44, and lost 19 of its members KIA on D-Day alone.  In the "Longest Winter: The Battle of the Bulge and the Epic Story of World War II's Most Decorated Platoon", Kershaw's sophomore effort, the historical centerpiece was the Intelligence and Reconnaissance (I&R) Platoon, 394th Infantry Regiment, 99th Infantry Division - a small group of men whose heroic stand at the small Belgian town of Lanzerath on 16 December 1944 against an overwhelming force (1st Battalion, Fallschirmjager Regiment 9) significantly stalled one of the main German efforts of the Ardennes Counteroffensive.  So what is the 'small unit theme' of Kershaw's current effort "The Few"?    From the subtitle one would assume that the story in "The Few" revolves around a group of American aviators who flew with the RAF during the Battle of Britain.  While this is not an entirely incorrect assumption the subtitle oversells the reality a bit.  Certainly the central characters through which the string of narrative is connected are this small group of American fliers.  Yet, in reality the overall story gains its real momentum and bite from the prose dedicated to the bigger picture of the Battle of Britain as told from the perspective of RAF fliers they fought with, and Luftwaffe fliers they fought against.  By using this latter approach Kershaw weaves a fabulously engaging story of the Battle of Britain.  This is a book that is hard to put down.  It is unfortunate that Da Capo Press has chosen subtitles for Kershaw's last two books that don't fairly represent the book's contents.  Kershaw however should not take the rap for his publisher wanting to sell books.  Hopefully Da Capo now recognizes that they have a winner in their stable and they no longer need to hype Kershaw's books to sell them.  Anyone with even a passing interest in the Battle of Britain should give "The Few" a chance, they may find a deeper interest in the topic and delve deeper into the plethora of books out their dedicated to this topic.  "The Few" is a 5 star read as primmer to the Battle of Britain from the perspective of individual and small groups of aviators on both sides of the Channel.   
 My baby's only a week old and he already enjoys looking at this book - we stand it up in his crib and he really seems to study the images, sometimes for 10-15 minutes at a time; he's very calm and alert while looking at it.  If we lay him flat on his back, he even turns his head toward the book to look at it.  The clean, simple black and white images are graphically appealing to adults as well - as a designer, I love being able to give my baby a book that not only reaches him on his level, but that I consider to have good design 
 "Do The Funky Pickle" by Jerry Spinelli is a very good book. It is about a group of four friends that are totally different. Theres Sunny, whose name does not match her personality at all. Eddie, who is kind of a whimp, but totally in love with Sunny. Pickles, the funny friend whose always willing to help you. Last but not least, Salem, the "author on the rise", who is also determined to get Sunny and Eddie together. After rejection of asking Sunny to the dance, Eddie and Pickles have to come up with some new moves, and fast. Pickles and Eddie make up a dance called "The funky pickle", hence the title. But, there dance doesn't quite make the right girl fall for Eddie, it's Angelpuss,not Sunny. Angelpuss is the girlfriend of the meanest toughest 8th grader. Can Eddie get out of this mess alive? Read "Do The Funky Pickle" to find out 
 This book, the final of the four-volume Buddies series, is by far the best in that series.  It is gripping; when I finished the book, I was emotionally drained and somewhat in shock -- the story ended and I was not exactly certain what had just happened to me, somewhat akin to viewing an accident or something else traumatic.  Having read the other three volumes in short succession, I raced through the book, shocked at points, dismayed by some characters' actions, and developed a whole new appreciation and affection for Cosgrove (helped by the fact that he and I are about the same age).  As I read the book, I hoped it would never end, as I wanted to continue to live the lives of these characters, but when I reached the unbelievably emotional and heavy end of the book, I realized one key element to all of Mordden's writing in this series: this series is a sort of gay male "Ring" cycle.  This book, the final one, entails the destruction of the entire world that was so carefully constructed throughout the first three books: like Ragnarok, it brings about the end of the old and the creation of a new world from its ashes.  I wished to see what came of these characters, to see if Little Kiwi/Virgil/J. would be redeemed, and how Cosgrove and Bud fared in this brave new world of the late 1980s: but then I realized, slowly, that it could not be seen as it was a whole different line of thought and not capable of being part of this series.  Heartbroken by this, but exhilarated at the same time, I commend this series, the author who wrote it, and highly recommend the series as a "must read" for all who appreciate contemporary gay fiction.  Absolutely astounding and by far the best of the series 
 This is one of the best books I have read recently.  I laughed, cried, and found such insight in the pages.  As a minister, I found sermon illustrations, and examples that will last me for a long, long time.  This is a must read, as are all of the Chicken Soup books - It will bring health to your soul.

 As a pharmacy student, I found the Washington Manual to be the best pocket guide for looking up guidelines and treatment options, as well as interaction charts and pregnancy categories.  This is a well written book that covers most of the major cronic health conditions and treatment.  This book does not waste time and space talking about every detail of each disease state, but rather focuses on the causes, measurements and treatments.  My only criticism is that this latest edition is dated 2004 and in medical therapeutics, is considered old 
 The last priest of Holy Wood, a sandy little hill near Ankh-Morpork, dies without a successor.  Were his daily chants and rituals actually holding something at bay, or were they the meaningless drivel of a dead religion?  Soon after his death, an alchemist in Ankh-Morpork invents the moving picture--the difficult part was to keep the film from exploding.  Victor Tugelbend, perpetual student-wizard and "the laziest person in the history of the world" sees the first moving picture projected on a sheet in an Ankh-Morpork square.  The next thing he knows, Victor is on the road to Holy Wood, along with C.M.O.T. Dibbler, low-life purveyor of 'sausage inna bun' and Gaspode, the Wonder Dog (the only one of the three who was smart enough to hitch a ride in a lumber wagon).  Holy Wood is now a ramshackle town, thrown together practically overnight and overflowing with humans, dwarfs, and trolls who want to make moving pictures.  Companies like 'Century of the Fruitbat Moving Pictures,' and 'Floating Bladder Pictures' are cranking out two-reelers like 'Sword of Passione,' 'The Third Gnome,' and 'Turkey Legs.'  Victor falls into the role of leading man.  Dibbler extorts his way into the role of leading producer.  Victor's leading lady, Ginger keeps dreaming that she's standing on a grate with hot air blowing up her skirt---that is when she's not walking in her sleep and trying to wake Something slumbering in the cave beneath the brand new city.  Reality is stretching thin between worlds.  When Dibbler decides to make a moving picture about Ankh-Morpork's Civil War, called 'Blown Away,' Holy Hell breaks loose.  "Moving Pictures" is Pratchett's satirical look at everything Hollywood, with puns and allusions rocketing overhead like shooting stars.  Many of his references are way over my head, e.g. 'Floating Bladder Pictures' and a moving picture called 'Turkey Legs,' but movie aficionados should nail down every one.  At least I figured out the golden statue named Oswald (or Osric), and the gigantic woman climbing the Tower of Art with a tiny ape clutched in its hand.  Basically, a good time is had by all in "Moving Pictures."  Although it is not as deeply philosophical as some of Pratchett's Disworld novels, Gaspode, the Wonder Dog does have some great lines, especially when he's shooting the breeze with the Rabbit, the Mouse and the Cat, and the Duck (waack waack waack waack!  Sorry Walt). 
 I looked at every IVF book around and chose this one to help me through the IVF process.  Things are explained in a way your fertility doctor would (or should) explain them, in a consise and easy-to-follow manner.  What I like most about the book is that it only covers IVF, not all high-tech treatments.  I highly recommend this book to those starting out on the road to IVF treatments 
 All of the complexities men have spun, and continue to spin, about God and his relationship to man disappear as fragile cobwebs in light of the simple but eloquently interwoven truths presented by this book.  I do not know why the critics, some even professing to be on enlightened spiritual paths, are so vicious in their attacks on this book. I do know, however, that this book answered questions for me that others failed to address.   I hope you ignore the critics, read the book and receive the gifts waiting for you 
 My children adored this book, and my grandbabies do as well.  It's particularly good for the 3 to 6 age group. It has everything--monsters, imagination, small boys.  A classic 
 When I first heard this album I was a bit shocked.  Myself and my fellow TMBG fans derided it as a "teen angst album," moaned and whined that John & John had betrayed us by adding a band, and generally refused to give it a chance. A few years later, listening to my entire collection of TMBG in chonological order (a sanity-restoration ritual), I realized that this album is AWESOME! There are only 2 stupid songs, Window and DirtBike.  Hey, for TMBG, that's not bad - their fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis.   Aside from that, there are more rockin', thought-provoking tunes here than you'll find almost anywhere.  This album establishes beyond a doubt that TMBG are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history. I'm not going to go over each individual song - there are millions of TMBG fans who have and will.  I will add my 2 cents about my 4 favorites however: "I Should be Allowed to Think" - TMBG does justice to beat poetry, and beyond! "Why Must I Be Sad?" - Funny and pissy, great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck.  The lyrics are genius, subtly quoting the best of Alice Cooper with tongue firmly planted in cheek. "A Self Called Nowhere" - Righteous, angry, and breathtaking.   Angsty punk bands of the world, take note: you will NEVER be this hardcore. "The End of the Tour" - I have written in my last wishes that I want this one played at my funeral.  One of the most moving and emotionally honest rock ballads ever written.  If your idea of TMBG is songs like "Istanbul" and "Particle Man," get over it!  And give this album a chance!  
 MOBY DICK is regarded as America's greatest novel.(GRAPES of WRATH is plausible 20th Century contender). It is epic quest about a godless,godlike ubermensch/superman "who'd strike the sun" if it insulted him determined to smash through walls of illusion...cardboard masks...to destroy the THING(Evil incarnate)that mauls and mars mankind without killing him outright, yet leaving the race to choke on blood of its own gaping wounds.AHAB is magnificent;he is(like Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov)border-line psychotic;and he is the EPITOME of the charismatic leader who will be a nation or world's Lincoln or Lucifer.  Structurally the novel is like THE OCEAN. Immensely large; difficult; occasionally tedius;deceptively calm and suddenly, titantically ferocious. From its depths breaches THE MONSTER from the ID:The unkillable BEAST.Yet Ahab and his stalwart Pequod Crew take-up "the impossible nightmare"and pursue the Child of Original Sin to certain death. No PM novel(or piece of pop dreck)can match the majesty of Moby Dick. As Melville called his "wicked" book it is the world's greatest anti-hero's plunge into the Heart of Darkness.Most modern illiterati would rather go the Spark note route,or Captain Beatty of Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451,comic summary. But for the few who ignore Elijah's warning: the novel remains worthy hunt for illumination into the depths of the human condition and the battle with Evil that eternally threatens 
 Because I can't stand the inane chatter of morning radio DJ's, I'll put on a CD as I'm getting ready to go to work. I teach at a high school for troubled teens, so the CD's I listen to are very particular--they can't be filled with words (because my day is filled with non-stop chattering, cursing teens), can't have the kind of beat that gets stuck in your mind all day, nothing sleepy and finally nothing that will encourage depression.  To find a beautiful, instrumental recording that meets all these tough criteria plus is just gorgeous, warm music is a treasure.  This great recording has tunes arranged smartly enough that it wouldn't feel unwelcome or off-season any time during the winter months.     
 This CD is one of the finest pop records ever made.  All material is great and the CD has a great flow.  Not a dud in the lot 
 This is the best photo printer I have seen.  I work at a print shop and it tops the very expensive printers that I use.  I am also a photograher and image and color quality is very important to me.  I get excellent results with this printer. 
 I bought this after reading other Amazon reviews.  I LOVE this Jumperoo.  I put my daughter in this when she was almost four months old (she has great neck control).  Although she couldn't reach the floor (pillow worked great underneath her) she immediately started to play with the toys and turn around in the seat.  Few days later she was a jumping fool.  She smiles and laughs in this thing.  Watch out for really messy diapers, poop jumps right up the back and front 
 This is perhaps the most beautiful album I have ever heard. To channel its emotions into words would do it an injustice and would be insulting the "music" and Brian Eno himself 
 This is an excellent compilation. It is titled "Best of" not "Greatest hits" and that is why some of their bigger hits, thank heavens, are not on this compilation. I wish they also had been kind enough to leave off "Your Mama Don't Dance..."-a cringingly bad pop song that made many college age folks not ever take this band seriously. That aside, there are some of L&Ms best material here. And unlike their previous best of, we don't need to boycott this one for cutting the 7:40 Angry Eyes down to 2:21, you get the full version here.  In the early seventies, alot of the songs that made it to radio hits were not the best songs from an album. Unlike the 1960's, singles were primarily for the pre-teen crowd by 1974. So the great songs by L&M like Nobody but You, Watching the River Flow and Angry Eyes were never top 40 hits.   Great sound quality and a good track selection. I also wish they had kept it more chronological, but since the bulk of it is from the first 3 albums, thats not really a problem. 
 After all my searching and looking I found this book.It covers everyting from the materials used in painting to techniques used,be they murals or encaustics.I cant leave it down.It pushes me even to try new things and consequently new work.It is a book for alchemists and artists alike.I got the hardback and it stays close to me at all times even when I fly!I have my copy smudged all over with blues,greens,etc.You will also read about picture framing and reparation of work...how to tackle mildew..the list just goes on.Its not for painting by numbers thats for sure.I set out to write a short review!A real tome of a book.Get it for reference or for its "secret" knowledge.Opens worlds for artists.Good luc 
 I've been a reader of mystery/romance novels for about 20 years now.  Unfortunately, many authors have turned to "trash" to sell.  This series of books takes the reader into characters' lives, showing realistic  examples of today's people searching for meaning in life... complete with  the battle of turning lose of self desires for the greater good and an even  bigger God.  Great find 
 This volume by Rand and her allies at the time, Alan Greenspan, and Nathaniel Branden, is excellent. Rand's articles show how the only moral political and economic system is capitalism. Property rights, reason and rational thought are what has freed man from the shackles of mysticism, superstition, and religious tyranny. The best articles are Branden's "Alienation" in which he points out the fallacies of the anti modern ideals of Erich Fromm's " The Art of Loving". Fromm is exposed as an admirer of the Dark Ages and pines for the ideals of collectivism. Another great article is Rand's " The Roots of War" in which she condemns the Vietnam War and the draft. She rightly points out the futility of Vietnam and the slavery that the draft creates. She smashes the ideals of conservative collectivism in her article " Conservatism: An Obituary" by show the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of conservatism. She exposes the conservative worship of "tradition" and "order". She also ridicules the weak and sorry defenses that conservatives state for capitalism, and freedom. This little book has some of Rand's best writings and thoughts. A great buy for those that support capitialism and freedom 
 The book was exactly what I was looking for and in excellent condition just like the seller said. The book arrived in the expected time frame as well. I would buy from this seller agin 
 I have read the 1980 edition of this book.  How to use the word miracle in one's vocabulary, but not accept the signs and wonders of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Birth, the ressurection, any event recorded in the Old Testament that goes against the laws of Nature. To accept the premise that God on rare occasions does something beyound the laws of Nature or the existence of God entirely, A modernist may use may use the word miracle to describe the unexpexted or an event happening despite the mathematical odds- but not an act by a supernatural being overruling the laws of Nature.  To not believe in such a Being, means to deny the facts described in the bible. These scholars do not accept the Lord God as described in the Bible. This type of Theologian albeit University instructor or Pastor of a church was quite prominant in Europe before 1870, but not in the United States until later. This book is a debate among those who accept the bible as true as it is and those who deny the word of God as valid.  The date of the book is not arbitrary. Since the author cites the end of the Civil war and Darwins theory of evolution as major cataylist to bringing the debate to the forefront in the United States. This includes the University, the pulpit and in the American Culture. This book is a narrative about social change in  American society, theological thought, and the major players in Christian Revivals and Theology. Not just the scholars in the Universities.  The book touches on changes in the Universities(1980 edition), but its main focus is on society. Is the Bible sufficient to show how God interacts with the created.   I found the reading interesting and easy to understand.  . 
 If you love Sylvia Plath's amazing poetry; if you have an affinity for either reading journals, or writing your own; or if you simply have an interest in the lifestyles and choices of women of some 50 years ago, these  collected journals are a must 
 I have recently purchasesd several DVDs with the goal of becoming more flexible.  My favorite is Ultimate Stretch, which isn't just a bunch of stretching exercises, even if there are a number of long holds. This will increase flexibility in your spine and hamstrings (watch out - it can be easy to overdo it) as well as work your upper body and leave you feeling pretty blissed out 
 This is one of those movies that you think to yourself - "This wacked out stuff could entirely happen." Because honestly, this wacked out stuff could entirely happen.  Where this movie misses is that when they are going for the serious, they are really kinda funny. However, when they are going for the funny, they end up just kind of lame. And honestly, the whole Fern/Violette subtext...waaay to over the top. They could have simply bribed her by putting her in the spotlight, not redirecting the spotlight toward her and then marveling at the monster that they created.  Great cameo from Marilyn Manson as the greaser in the bar. And the Donna's playing the prom...I went to see them in concert and they are almost worth picking up this movie all on their own 
 It took me a few chapters to become hooked, perhaps more than most books seasoned with thick prose.  The language of the author was very eloquent, but different.  Without being hyperbolic, it was a bit like reading Shakespeare in that you must find the rhythm of the writer, but when you do it comes to you in a natural and pleasant fashion.  The characters, especially Mina, are multi-faceted and well-developed throughout the trilogy.  I mention Mina because it is tempting to see her initially as flat and unidimensional. But she is not.  To demonstrate this, most readers will find themselves rooting for her and fearing her simultaneously. By the end of the trilogy you're concept of her will take another, quite unexpected turn - sympathy or pity. (You'll have to find out why).  I bought this compulsively from a HB bargain bin and it sat on my shelf for more than a year and finally read it when I got bored. I missed out.  This has become one of my favorite series and I am willing to try other series from Weis.  This was well worth the purchase and serious fantasy fans should try it 
 I read this book at age 14 and now at my 30's i had to buy this hardcover for my fantasy collection books. Starting reading from the beginning, I'm excited again. This trilogy will be definitely remembered for ages  
 This book is very good and funny!.. i used a monologue from the play for and audition. It went well. i recomend this book to anybody 
 Growing A Business by Paul Hawken is one of the easiest book to read on building business. Rather than saying what you must do, Paul share and shows you why he did certain things; allowing you to digest the underlying guidelines to build a business.  I highly recommend anyone who is starting out to read this book. It is easy to digest and a joy to read 
 This was a well written book though I did not realize it focused on vegetarian dishes.  Still - it's all good, just may be hard to find some of the ingredients 
 Stark does a good job of fleshing out sociological reasons why Christianity became the dominant religion in the Roman Empire in so little time. Some of the stats and figures were hard to get through, but overall it was an informative read, and I walked away having learned more about Roman society in general and the reasons for the rapid and widespread acceptance of Christianity in that social contect. 
 The truth is that many US chemists (hell, all chemists) are lazy when it comes to math. (Ok, so maybe some theory guys aren't, but they all dress in black and have bad attitudes or big egos so they aren't your garden variety chemist...) Well, the good news is that this book can really help to remedy some of those situations... Many of the very useful topics are presented in a concise manner and therefore in a non-threatening and appealing way... Very good as a first reference and also helps with some radial function transforms and the like (Jacobians and etc...) My only major problem with the book is that it doesn't have anything on statistics, but then again, most analytical books give a good appendix on that subject anyway, so you can find it there.. 
 This book is great! I recommend this book to everyone that likes to read and also the ones that don't because it is very interesting. This book has funny,sad, cool, and not much boring things 
 This is Francis Bacon's model for America. Many believe it is the vision of the ancient spiritual adepts. Fascinating reading and most provoking 
 The world lost a real gem of a writer when Stan Berenstain passed on November 29.  Together, Berenstain and his wife, Jan, and eventually their two sons, created books featuring lovable but flawed characters who tackle just about every real issue that faces families.    Too Much TV is one of those issues that is becoming more and more prevalent.  What's wonderful about this book is that it shows that not only the kids have trouble with TV, but Papa does also.  That's a great message: kids are not the only ones who have flaws, adults have them, too!  Everyone can get stuck into bad habits sometimes, and in this modern age of more and more technology, it's only getting worse.  But crafts and other hobbies that don't involve a tube are just as much fun, and it's a lifelong pursuit to remind ourselves of this.  This book is a wonderful place to start 
 I brought this for my husband because we own an older model vehicle with a cassette player and he enjoys listening to the cassette 
 I was required to buy this book for a entry-level college psychology class.  So far I have read about 5 chapters (experiments).  Each experiment is broken down into it's own chapter, with a total of around a dozen chapters.  I've enjoyed the book so far and would recommend it 
 Turbo Tax Deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item. Also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return. It's very annoying to find and adjust the State Return once you have gone back into your Federal Return. I think it is a very good product BUT they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas ESPECIALLY for the STATE RETURN 
 Mansfield was in competition with Virigina Wolf during her short life - the one female writer who could compete with the proverbial literary giantess of the pre-war era (as Wolf herself admitted - she respected the former's talent).  I think Mansfield ranks as true literary bloom of the first quarter of the 20th century as a generality, hobnobbing with Irish talent like Joyce and fitting into that stage that also held T. E. Lawrence and John Buchan - the male writers always dominating.  Mansfield represents the rank outsider, not male, not "English" but breaking through into recognition while she lived.  Her writing is distinctly impressionist in flavour.  Sentences broken and stories only half complete.  But she writes beautifully, often echoing her impending death from TB.  An outsider with her sexuality in how she experimented including a brief pretence of motherhood and her spirituality.  She attended Gurdjieff's centre and was obviously fond of the pragmatism of certain Eastern traditions compared to the prevailing cult.   But she only reveals so much in her writing.  So much remaining unsaid.  Happy stories like "Bliss" and funny stories like "The school mistress".  So many details from life at the time like ships, parties, schools, courtship, and the lives of ordinary people from the well bred elites to the downtrodden poor.  Mansfield frequently displays a sympathy for the underdog and cries out about the transience of things and the lack of stability in pleasure - vaguely Buddhist even ...  But her stories are yet so English with glimpses of her native New Zealand from which she was divorced.  She write well about the dazzle of things like summer or flowers, children, sounds and people - everything highlighted.  She is so good with colloquial speech and represents it well ... conversations that bring out sentiments of characters and in the reader.  You can't get enough of this genre.  The only genre she knew.  Little cartoons of short stories, almost always making a point, sometimes sharp but not overtly moralistic.  Everything is so precise, a melody from the heart.  This like any other collection of her work is worth attention, to read or as a gift.  The introduction is good and Mansfield will probably for ever remain not too well known but a gem to those who find her 
 I first found this foil cutter on a trip in Italy and found it so practicle that I researched the internet in order to purchase additional quatities because I could not find them locally. These cutters make great gifts for all your wine lover friends and family 
 Look up a word. You will find a list of synonymns. You'll find a definition and correct useage guide for each of the synonyms. And, if the word has antonyms, you'll find those as well. This book is a must for students and writers 
 Narrated through the heartfelt voice of Amy Tan, the Kitchen God's Wife illustrates a compelling story of heritage and self-discovery. As a young Chinese woman, Winnie Louie, the main character and the conduit through which Tan expresses her voice, must endure an atrocious life under the abuse and torture of her wicked husband Wen Fu, a pretentious, arrogant, and egregious man who not only cheated his way up the military ladder, but also committed numerous felons including rape, murder, blackmailing, and extortion. Day after day, beating after beating, Winnie slowly begins to realize that in order to escape from Wen Fu and start a new life free from violence and marked by love, radical and immediate actions must be taken. When dealing with someone without even a modicum of human decency, someone like Wen Fu, the usual, traditional, and orthodox actions are futile. Striking a perfect chord between concision and elaboration, Tan keeps the reader constantly engaged as the dramatic story of Winnie unfolds itself. Relying mostly on authentic voice and keeping the meretricious elements to a minimum, Tan narrates the novel with surprising precision and unmatched beauty. Against the magnificent backdrops of a WWII-era China, the novel reassures the universal nature of mankind, that the problems troubling people today are experienced by all generations, regardless of race, nationality, or social status. As you read this rare gem amount literature, open the introspective window and enjoy the novel with your heart. 
 This movie is all about character development of people who are all drastically different.  This is a comming of age film for the 1980's.  The acting is wonderful.  It is a different style of movie.  There were some really great movies comming out then.  Ferris Beulers Day off, Pretty in Pink and some kind of wonderful.  This is another one.  It is a classic of the time period for the people comming of age durning this time.  The 1980's is a time I was fond of.  I do not find it tacky as the media is right now.  This movie is funny.  Some of these classics get refered to in  other movies.  You might want to watch it 
 This album is different in the way that it is softer. It is catchier and has some more accessible material on it. Some people might say that is a bad thing, but this album is the best one they have released and I love it! The songs are structured so well and the singer has such a unique delivery that I have found myself listening to it over and over again. Their last cd was good, but you could tell that it wasn't thought out completely. It was pretty much brutal and in your face and that can get old. This album maintains the heaviness from before, but with a twist, there's more singing! The music is fierce and the drumming is phenomenal! This band is made or broke on the talent of their singer though. He delivers tremendously on this album. You can hear it in his voice that he is giving you all he has to give and you can't ask for much more in a lead singer people. This cd is great and it's one of my top 5 for 2006! Please support this band. IF you are thinking about buying this then all I have to say is buy the damn thing! It is great and the band is great and they deserve to go places. There is not a bad song on here but the ones that stand out to me the most are as follows:"fractured" "hourglass" "fade away" "s.o.s." and "definition of a hero". Check this album out guys if you like killswitch engage, shadows fall, and any other great metal core band 
 Who doesn't love music with their shower?  I originally purchased a much pricier player from The Sharper Image, which stopped playing within the first month.  Luckily, still under warranty, I got a replacement.  This one stopped after four months ... no longer under the 90 day warranty.  So then I did the research and this one's the one.  I love it.  It's much more compact than TSI model, significantly sturdier, hangs from anywhere in your shower as well as free stands unobtrusively anywhere else, less expensive, easy to use and program, with a latching door that you know keeps the water out.  Just an all around nicely designed, user friendly CD player 
 This book was a required reading during my first-year of high school in a course called Humanities 9 and I thought it was a pretty interesting, but very scary read. I must warn you: If you dislike violence, or are adverse to killing in any shape or form, then don't even think, I repeat, don't even THINK about considering this novel, as it is filled with intense violence and there are definitely some killings. Most of this violence is done by a character called Okonkwo, who in a desperate attempt to cover up any sign of weakness, will resort to extremely brutal measures, such as literally pounding with his fist or slaughtering with some huge weapon anyone unfortunate enough to anger him, especially his children. You see, this Okonkwo is a big fella (about 7' 3", weighing approximately 300 lbs) and he is also the championship wrestler of his village, so you KNOW a beating from this dude is gonna hurt. He is also a warlike fellow who treats cowardice like a disease, the only cure of which is an extremely severe beating as his children often experience. If you so much as cry or act in a timid or sensitive manner, then you can expect to feel the wrath of Okonkwo, that is, a severely intense beating that is akin to having a giant boulder fall right on top of you. It is some pretty intense stuff and Okonkwo is definitely Mr. No Play, and that is what makes this book so chilling, yet so compelling and captivating all at the same time 
 This is the bands best effort yet.  Their maturity as a band and as people shines through in the musicianship and the lyrics.  If you are a Switchfoot fan, you won't be dissappointed 
 The short novel Night has emotional power not only because of the dark subject matter, but because Elie Wiesel is a gifted writer who deftly reveals the spiritual and mental anguish of the main character.  Generally considered autobiographical, the account follows a young man who feels he is losing not only God, but his humanity as the Nazi machine ravages Europe.  The novel itself deserves 10 stars.    However, the original translation deserves -1.  Wiesel's skill as an author is blurred by a clumsy translation.  The worst part is when the translator chose the lighthearted "siesta" as a description of Wiesel's first sleep in the labor camp.  There is a much better translation out today by Marion Wiesel, and its worth the extra few dollars.  This book is more than worth reading; buy the better translation, and you'll understand why Wiesel deserved not just the Nobel Peace Prize, but also the Literature Prize 
 I've never even heard of this movie before, I only rented it cause I'm on a noble quest (just like a knight!) to see every Criterion DVD.  And I'm glad I did cause this movie is hilarious!  I loved it.  I'd even buy a copy if I wasn't flat broke.  Aristocrat Fefe cannot stand his wife.  Loud, annoying, crazy facial hair she grates on his nerves all day then wants to cuddle, etc all night.  Yuck!  Lucky for him though there is a 16-year-old hottie next door that is in love with him.  Yes!  Now all he has to do is get rid of his wife, but since divorce is illegal he's just gonna have to kill her, but that means prison unless!  Unless he catches her in the arms of another man then he'll get less than 3 years!  But who would ever want to be with his wife?  Flawlessly directed with an almost psychotic intensity I think I grinned like an idiot the entire movie.  And the performance!  Everybody was great, but Marcello Mastroianni was absolutely brilliant.  I'd laugh even when he was just standing around thinking.    Double feature this with THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH.  D: Pietro Germi (MY FRIENDS, SEDUCED AND ABANDONED) W: Ennio De Concini (SALON KITTY, BLACK SUNDAY)  Ferdinando Cefalu - Marcello Mastroianni (LA DOLCE VITA, 8 1/2) Rosalina Cefalu - Daniela Rocca (THE SUCKER, BEHOLD A PALE HORSE) Angela - Stefania Sandrelli (1900, THE CONFORMIST)  
 This case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two-weeks-per-month business travel.  The good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole.  The bad part is that it takes up half my carry-on suitcase.  But that's what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment 
 Mark does an excellent job relating the important parts of Goldratt's story to the actions needed to begin to reduce much of the chaos that attends projects in most organizations. Mark's writing is clear and concise, and illustrations are simple and effective. He sharpens the focus of Goldratt's work and translates the key ideas into usable information. Success with critical chain continues in many organizations large and small, and on many types and sizes of projects. A valuable addition to any project manager's library 
 This is one of my favorite books on the `Old Testament.'  What makes Brueggemann's analysis so compelling is his ability to offer a coherent and comprehensive reading of the Old Testament, while equally dealing with the difficulties, disunities, and flat-out confounding passages that fill the `Old Testament' cannon.  Brueggemann does so by looking at, what he refers to as, the `Christian Imagination.'    In short, Brueggemann is not as concerned with how the `history' of the Old Testament does or does not match up with the historicism of late scholasticism.  After all, I think we can all agree that a person writing in the age of antiquity would have a substantially different method and/or intent in his or her written approach than would an eighteenth or nineteenth century historian.  For starters, the Jewish writers of antiquity were writing a narrative history, not a history accompanied with narratives.  This is an important distinction.  In short, their end goal was to tell their story, which they also believed to be God's story.  This story inevitably incorporated, and even required, elements of history; yet it was the story itself that always took first priority.    Accordingly, Brueggemann's reading of the `Old Testament' is cohesive  and coherent  because he understands that it must be read as the narrative story of a historical people, not as a history of a narrative people.  
 I have found a lot of great recipes in this book! For a while we tried using the weekly list but had a few problems. Many of the ingredients can be expensive, including quite a bit of meat, etc. and also several dinners per week did not appeal to my family, so I couldn't use the weekly list because I had to weed out the ingredients that were needed for the recipes I wasn't going to be making. So it ended up being easier for me to go through each recipe and make my own list which defeated part of the purpose of the book. There are lots of recipes in here that I have made more than once, but there are also many recipes that I have never tried again, or would never try in the first place. So if you are looking for a good recipe book, you'll find one here... but if you are looking for the weekly meal plan/grocery list deal... you probably will not be happy with this 
 As Chairman of the Advisory Board to The John Entwistle Foundation (www.johnentwistle.org) I am proud to have this incredible book in my library.  John's humor is shown vivdly throughout this book and his guitar collection was the envy of all musicians.  In his life, John was a giver - check out the Foundation where our mission is to bring music education to underprivileged children.  We will continue to give in John's name 
 Admittedly, I first read Tally's Corner almost three decades ago -- and it still has a hold over me.  In those 30 years, I went from studying sociology to making films to doing start-ups in Silicon Valley.  I am now in the process of ordering more copies to distribute to friends.  Tally's Corner is an exceptional work.  It had its origins in a doctoral thesis and yet it reads like a novel.  Its powerful message aside, Tally's Corner is marvelous reading.  Anyone who wants to write something important and lasting should look to Liebow to see how it is done.  Tally's Corner defies the contrary logic which says "no pain, no gain" -- that all things profound must to be impossible for everyman to understand 
 I grew up knowing about La Leche League because my mother nursed all five of her children until we were three years old. When I got pregnant I knew I wanted to breastfeed and I got this book. Yes, it does cover the LLL philosophy but if you don't agree with it you can still get some very valuable information from it. The chapter on "The Manly Art of Fathering" is a chapter especially for dads that I am sure most breastfeeding books wouldn't think to include. This book is a great resource because you can take from it what applies to your individual situation. I would love to stay home but I had to go back to work. This book helped me understand that breastfeeding my son was the best thing I could do, especially going back to work. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to breastfeed because it is supportive and informative 
   Washington insider and biographer Sally Bedell Smith opens the doors to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue during the Kennedy administration. This is a revealing look at the private passions, joys, griefs and lives of those people who were stars in the Kennedy court. We also get a good look at Jack Kennedy and his wife Jackie. Those readers expecting a tabloidish perusal will be disappointed. This is a serious book and deals with the major obstacles faced by Kennedy in his short term prior to the tragedy of Dallas. We learn: how Kennedy dealt with Khrushchev; the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missle Crisis; the burgeoning furor over integration and the relationship Kennedy developed with his staff and Congress. We learn about the lives and opinions of such key Kennedy loyalists as Bob McNamara; LBJ; Dean Rusk. We are invited to the Kennedy compound where we become better acquainted with that fascinating family. US involvement in Vietnam following the overthrow of Diem is also discussed with intelligent commentary,   Jack Kennedy was brilliant. He was also ill with many problems most notably his Addison's disease. Kennedy was a notorious womanizer who was amoral! The press of the day did not reveal his many affairs with everyone from Marilyn Monroe to White House secretaries. Jack Kennedy was not a nice man!    Jackie was a jet setter who loved to spend money on clothes, travel and shopping sprees. She was also highly intelligent, engineered much needed White House renovation and was a plus on diplomatic jaunts abroad. In Paris she talked fluent French with De Gaulle and represented the US well in trips to such places as India.    This is a fine book for those seeking more knowledge of the Kennedy White House. Along with the book by Richard Reeves it is a good introduction to John Kennedy and the 1000 days this modern day Prince Arthur and his Guineviere reigned over America 
 TWO THUMBS UP FOR CHEIHK ANTA DIOP AND 10 STARS TO THIS CLASSIC BOOK. THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS WERE BLACK AFRICANS! ESPECIALLY THE OLD KINGDOM. MENES,KHUFU,THUTMOSIS THE 3RD,KING TUT,KHAFRE,DJOSER ,SNEFERU AND MOST OF THE OLD KINGDOM PHARAOHS WERE BLACK AFRICANS. I RESEMBLE MOST OF THESE KINGS, AND I HAVE YET TO SEE A WHITE PERSON OF EUROPEAN DECSENT RESEMBLING ANY OF THESE KINGS OR EGYPTIANS PERIOD. BLACK OR BROWN SKIN, FLAT NOSE KINKY OR CURLY HAIR, WHITE PEOPLE YOU DO NOT LOOK LIKE THIS. AND IF YOU FIND A WHITE THAT DOES, HE OR SHE IS EITHER BLACK OR HAVE  BLACK BLOOD, IT'S THAT SIMPLE. WHY HATE DIOP FOR EXSPOSING THE TRUTH? WESTERN WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY DEFINES THE WORD NEGRO AS A MEMBER OF  A RACIAL GROUP HAVING BROWN TO BLACK SKIN. CHECK OUT THE PAINTING ON THE TOMB OF RAMSES THE 3RD 1200 B.C. THIS IS A REPESENTATION OF THE RACES AT THAT TIME FROM THE EGYPTIANS POINT OF VIEW. THE FIRST MAN REPESENTS THE EGYPTIAN, THE SECOND MAN REPESENTS THE INDO-EUROPEAN, THE THIRD MAN REPESENTS THE REST OF BLACK AFRICA AND THE FOURTH REPESENTS THE SEMITE. BUT IF YOU'LL NOTICE THE FIRST MAN AND THE THIRD MAN HAS THE SAME BLACK  SKIN COLOR AND THEY ARE BOTH DRESSED ALIKE. WHAT WERE THE EGYPTIANS SAYING? THAT NOT ONLY WERE THEY THE SAME AS FAR AS SKIN COLOR AS THE REST OF BLACK AFRICA BUT THAT THEY LOOKED TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE INDO-EUROPEAN AND SEMITE. HOW IN THE WORLD CAN WHITE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO CLAIM EGYPT AS A WHITE CIVILIZATION AND DENY THAT THEY WERE BLACK WHEN THE EGYPTIANS THEM SELVES LEFT EVIDENCE IN THIS ANCIENT PAINTING? WHITE PEOPLE  HAVE A HARD ENOUGH TIME TRYING TO GET AND KEEP A SUN-TAN  WITHOUT KILLING THEMSELVES WITH SKIN CANCER, BLACK PEOPLE IN AFRICA AND AMERICA HAVE SKIN COLOR THAT RANGES FROM COAL BLACK,DARK BROWN,REDDISH BROWN AND LIGHT BROWN. ANY THING AFTER THIS IS BECAUSE OF MIXING. THE SAME WITH ANCIENT EGYPT. SO GIVE IT UP WHITE PEOPLE THERE'S TOO MUCH EVIDENCE NOW. GROW UP AND EXCEPT THE FACTS THIS IS A VERY, VERY GREAT BOOK TO READ AND I WOULD ADVISE ALL DESCENDENTS OF AFRICA TO DEVOUR IT. PHARAOH 
 This is essential Tom Peters. It is the beginnings of what he later wrote about in Re-Imagine! It may not have too much to implement in terms of process but definitely has plenty of thought adjustments that should be made to survive, NO THRIVE, in the new economy. It can help you regain your drive because Tom identifies many of the frustrating business practices that we all deal with and encourages you to get mad about it and do something about it.  This is a great book if you want to open your mind to new possibilities for your career. It helped shape my overall attitude about business by revealing some of what business can and must become. Much more concise and to the point and builds upon his prior, and more lengthy, books. It is one of his best if not 'the' best books he has written. Tom's energy is contagious. Worth every penny 
 I went through sorority rush at California State University, Long Beach in the mid seventies. After reading this book I understand why I was totally rejected by all the sororities on campus. The main reason I was rejected  because I was overweight.  This was because of a medical problem that I had  at the time, it was not from overeating.  One of the chippies in one of the  sororities told me that they might "take me up" but that she  couldn't "make any promises". Another sorority telephoned me and  invited me to dinner and tghen called me the same day and told me that they  were going to have "initiation of officers" and not to come. They  said that they would "get back to me" but they never did.  No one  ever asked me about my family background.  My father was a Naval officer  who was present at Pearl Harbor at the time it was bombed.  So after  reading this book I know now what was going on during sorority rush 
 Finally, those of us who care about Lance Henriksen's work can see him in a starring role. The film is a powerful religious allegory with deep implications for what it means to be human. If you like Lance, you really need to see this one. If you like good moral fables, you really need to see this one. Oh, what the heck...you really need to see this one 
 In Fatal Flowers, Rosemary Daniell confronts reality as she shares her own struggles with the bondage of Southern womanhood. She does so in a shockingly honest way.  She takes her readers on a sexual tour of the South  as she suffers through the pain of her own life and that of her mother.   Her book made me more able to confront the truths of my own life 
 Book arrived in perfect condition, and it arrived earlier than i expected.  Also, it's a great book that everyone should read.  
 There's nothing I like better than truly helpful lists and hints unless it is those same lists and hints dished up with a generous sense of humor.  Stephanie had me laughing and reading out loud to my daughter-in-law and constantly exclaiming: "look at this!" while we drove to the yarn store for more supplies.  So if you want a handy dandy list of typical head sizes or typical foot lengths (the kind of valuable info provided) topped off with WHO wears WHAT hats and WHY, you will love this book.  The basics are addressed here, along with some fine points and finer observations that will have you consulting this book again and again.  And if you want to relax and really enjoy your knitting - or your stash or your knitting thoughts (guilt-free) - get this book just to read for fun.  It works either way 
 This book has been tremendously helpful, I have read it multiple times and learn something new every time. I would recommend this book to anyone who has found themselves newly single. It's hard enough to be alone, this book definitely helps explain the feelings 
 i first heard the poem read on the TV special with Oprah honouring the legends and the youngun's, in the African American world. Regardless of me not being African American, the poem touched me deeply and reminded me of the many women that have touched my life. this little book is definitly a keeper!  Thank you for sharing it with all of us that really do walk in the footprints of so many that have paved the way for us in this world 
 Wow - this book was a big surprise.  It was something that my kids had picked out at the library, and now we are planning to buy our own copy.  With it's main character, Slobosaurus, showing children (and adults too) how we take our environment for granted, the lessons of the simple ways to correct this are great for children ages 4-8 (and even up through adults).  Kids learn everything from not wasting paper to recycling to the fact that 1 gallon of water is used every minute that it is left running.  The illustrations are great and only add to the book.  This book is a great asset to any children's collection 
 I really love this CD. I heard about her when I was studing music at college, but I thought that it was just a myth. Well, she did exsist and WOW......what a recording!!!  The first time that I heard Miss Jenkins "sing", I fell out of my chair and onto the floor laughing. But, I have been thinking, she may have had ZERO musical talent, but she got on stage and did what she loved: opera. I really respect a person who can say, I don't give a damn what anyone thinks, I'm doing what makes me happy. And you know what, 70+ years after she made this recording, people are STILL talking about her and still buying her albums. There were a lot of very talented opera singers of her time that have been compleatly forgotten about. Mabey, in the end, Miss. Jenkins was the most talented person in the room.  
 Anyone who appreciated Who Stole Feminism?, where Christina Hoff Sommers corrects what passes for feminist statistics will find plenty to love in these 123 pages.  Diana Furchtgott-Roth and Christine Stolba explain with tons of data why the "wage gap" and "glass ceiling" are myths based on bad statistics and a less than thorough investigation of the facts. The authors spell out the truth, that we should be celebrating women's progress. Feminists should be bragging that women earn the majority of bachelor's and master's degrees and that women-owned businesses are growing faster than businesses overall instead of inventing discrimination where it clearly doesn't exist, as the stats in this book prove.  This book should be required reading in women's studies classes, but unfortunately the half-truths often spread in such classes are the reason this book needed to be written in the first place 
 THE BOOK Homesick:My Own Story is about a REAL author telling of the times when she lived in China and her thoughts and feelings. Now Jean Fritz is a well known author- not a girl homesick for a home she had never been in.What really got me interested in her book was her.She came to my school when I was studying China (2nd grade).I have always been a reader(I read the 4th Harry Potter book in less then 12 hrs!), even in 2nd grade, but at the time, I wasn't interested in thosew types of history and culture books.I recently joined a book club and they choose the book.Now I'm glad I read it.....it is one of the best historical books I have ever read! (my friend is going 2 CHINA! 
 With characteristic wit, intellect and open-mindedness, Robert McNeil and William Cran explore the protean version of English used in America. Though they give ample time to the prescriptivist side of the argument (the side concerned with enforcing rules and determining standards of proper usage), they are clearly more in the descriptivist camp, fascinated by the way the language is actually used.  The times are on their side. Informal language, once kept out of dictionaries and standards guides by the educated elite, is rushing into normal use at breakneck speed. These days, a word is hardly coined before it has been snatched up by major media outlets and put into print. And rushed out of print almost as quickly. Last week, I heard the word "gnarly" used to described a snowstorm. My teenage son was appalled. "When was the last time you heard anyone say 'gnarly'?" he asked incredulously. Mind you, this word is all of 10 years old, and it is already considered passé.  McNeil and Cran describe the way American language standards are affected by the media, social trends, technology, the tastes of elites, regional accents, racial history and even civic pride. Yet they claim that accent leveling --the homogenizing of regional speech patterns -- is largely a myth. In spite of the disappearance of certain isolated regional accents and vocabulary -- like those of Down East Maine -- some accents are actually growing in strength. Pittsbughers, for instance, are consciously proud of their distinctive pronunciations, a fact that keeps them (the pronunciations) alive. Too, most people (including this writer) don't usually consider themselves to have accents at all. Our own speech is "normal"; it's those other folks who have accents!  Those wishing to build predictable, enduring rules for American English are bound to dislike this book. McNeil and Cran even demolish the idea that these rules have even been around for a long time. Many were decided, after long years of variation, in the last few decades by a single influential writer. The idea of taming the use of English, when it is being twisted and molded into new shapes almost daily, seems a fool's errand. Long-fought causes now seem lost -- restricting "hopefully" to mean "It is hoped that" rather than the more common, "filled with hope"; using "impact" only as a noun; using "indices" (rather than "indexes") as the plural of "index"; the unstoppable American habit of splitting infinitives. Yet McNeil and Cran urge us not to despair. We are witnessing not the degeneration of English, but its continual evolution. Though I personally would like to see people distinguish "ensure" (to make certain) from "insure" (to protect oneself with an insurance policy) such decisions are not in my hands 
 A Windham Hill Christmas is a delightful, calming presentation of seasonal favorites -- perfect for a quiet, cozy eve before the fire.  The new or veteran WH listener will find a nice collection of the labels best artists - Brickman, de Grassi, ACkerman (guitar), Winston (piano), Nightnoise (instrumental/vocal) -- as well as the lesser known who lend variety and depth to this collection.  A Windham Hill Christmas is a pleasant continuation of the atmosphere created in the label's Winter Solstice and December albums and calming contrast to the pop, rock and new age, electronically synthesized tones for a more hectic pace 
 What an unusual way to spend a day, month, or maybe just an hour at one of the many strange & somewhatout of this world cafe's & hotels. You would think that maybe that wrong turn you took ended up being on another planet besides earth, so what ! these places are so much fun & entertaining than why worry if a person is on some other solar system ! The characters & places are never boring, I can say that I was entertained through out this entire book. I would recommend it to anyon 
 Another excellent book from health and nutrition expert Gary Null.  Dr Garry Null is always at the center of what you need to know.  Power Aging by Gary Null is an extremely useful practical guide for people who are looking for a longer and healthier life.  This book has lot of facts and details, detailed in the most easy to understand manner.  Important factors for a healthier life are healthy eating habits, good nutrition, and regular exercise.  In this book the author also deals specifically with alternative approaches to heart disease, cancer, the aging brain, and anti-aging in general. Since I have been on this diet, all the cravings for junk food have gone. I use to crave coffee in the morning as well but realized I didn't want that wired up feeling 
 Like the old Doublemint gum ads you get Two-Two-Two good things in one from "Advertising to Baby Boomers." Chuck Nyren has written a guide to successfully advertising to boomers from the ad buyers point of view, and gives great insights into the boomer market as well. There's only one thing to do with this book - Buy it! Then enjoy the wonderful humor, serious analysis, and gutsy commentary about how to get the most from working with an agency to get your message across. It's a book that will remain a resource for years to come.  John Migliaccio, Ph.D. President Maturity Mark Services co, Co-Author, "77 Truths about Marketing to 50+ Consumers 
 I love the design and the size of this memory card reader.  Very portable and works great.  Reads pretty much all memory cards that are out there on the market at the moment.  Would recommend it and would buy it again 
 I'm not a huge fan of horror, but I am a fan of Dan Simmons.  _Hyperion_ is one of my favorite sci-fi novels; _Hardcase_ and _Hard Freeze_ are wonderful, by-the-book "hard"-boiled detective novels.  I just happened to be in an airport needing a book to read, saw this, and thought it must be the same Dan Simmons, author of all genres.  I read it in one sitting, which is perhaps not saying much because the book's fairly short, at least for Simmons, and the flight was international.  As much as I like movies, I don't even think I glanced up to see what was playing.  When I read this book, I didn't realize it was the second part of a story of which _Summer of Night_ was the first.  It stands on its own.  In fact, I liked it better than the first book, which I went out and found as soon as I got home.  That may have been because I formed strong images of the characters as children from this book, whereas the more explicit rendering of them didn't quite match my expectations.  This is first and foremost a psychological horror story, not a gory monster story.  It's told from the perspective of a minor academic and pulp Western author trying to resolve his confusing past.  (Note to the author: If you write a Western, I'll read that, too.) In fact, it's even more psychological than Simmons's own _Carrion Comfort_, which I also quite enjoyed.  This book is scary because you wind up deep inside the mind of the main character, with all of his pre-occupations and uncertainty about what's real.    Simmons's novels are all about the characterization, much like many independent, off-beat, or "foreign" movies.  If you're looking for Hollywood-style special effects and big bad monsters, turn to the master of that genre, Steven King (not to knock King's characterizations, which are also superlative).  Some of the scariest bits are run-ins with ordinary characters from his childhood.  In the end, I can't give this a better review than to recapitulate my title: it still gives me goosebumps thinking about it 
 Offbeat as this movie is, there is a priceless exchange of dialogs between Turner's China Blue and Perkin's Shane, the street preacher. It is this dialog alone I feel is worth watching it for. It is irreverent, offbeat, and on occasion down right goofy.  One can not help but feel that the preacher is only a figment of China Blue's imagination, a battle of her conscience, and the struggle between good and evil.  It is a shame that the talents of Anthony Perkins was not fully realized. This part is tailor made for him in many ways.   
 Cheech and Chong are back as the usual miscreants whose motto is nothing less than sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.  Their present adventure carrying all the same low-brow humor as in their other great comedy films.  Cheech and Chong are now in Detroit working for an Arab sheik and his body guard (also played by Cheech and Chong) who own a car wash named 'The Two Guys From Mecca'.  Being involved in rather shady business, the sheik gives Cheech and Chong a job driving a limousine to Las Vegas as a drive-away with $10,000 stashed in one of the seats.  Broke and having no knowledge of the hidden money, the comic pair soon has to come up with clever ways of paying their way to Sin City.  The audience follows Cheech and Chong in their wild trek to Las Vegas while they're being chased by their two angry employers: how will they get out of this pickle?  Another great adventure with the two miscreants of comedy. This film is just as great as their other films such as 'Up In Smoke' and 'Nice Dreams'.  Don't miss it 
 any leftish baffon who writes comments like yours proves that i need to read the book. i look forward to a terrific read. 
 "If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher ... If you do take this note to the police, I will kill an elderly woman active in charity work ... The choice is yours." (The 1st note.)  Billy Wiles just wants to bar keep at a roadside tavern in Vineyard Hills, CA. And, of course, spend frequent evenings at the nursing home bedside of his fiancee Barbara, comatose these past four years after consuming a can of tainted vichyssoise. Billy doesn't have much of a life until he begins receiving mysterious notes that promise the slaughter of apparently random victims - promises that are always kept - by an elusive killer that, at one point, gets the drop on Wiles and nails one of his hands to the floor. To Billy's dismay, he's fallen down a rabbit hole into the world of a psycho who approaches murder as performance art.  I've read a smattering of Dean Koontz's novels, some of which have reached such a level of bizarreness that they lose appeal for me. I appreciate more subtlety. In any case, with VELOCITY, Koontz steps back from the edge just far enough to make this a mystery thriller that, while still frightening, is also plausible. I understand that THE HUSBAND is in much the same vein, but better; it waits, much anticipated, on my unread shelf even now.  I have two niggling complaints about this book's plot. I wish Ivy Elgin, a waitress at the tavern with an interest in haruspicy, i.e., divination of the future from dead animals, had gotten a larger share of text time. She is, perhaps, the most potentially interesting character present. Finally, at the story's conclusion, I felt that the killer knew more about Wiles than me the reader. True, one learns that, through no fault of his own, Billy is forced at age fourteen to shoot both his parents, and that, as an adult, he's written a book of short stories. Beyond that, he's a virtual cipher. Since putting the same characters in a sequel isn't the author's usual style to the extent I know it, I doubt we shall see either Billy or Ivy again, and that's unfortunate.  VELOCITY approaches being a couldn't-put-it-down read 
 The Great Escape is my favorite movie of all time.  It is an excellant movie and follows the book it is based on very well.  This movie shows the courage, strength and fighting spirit of these men.  And it is truely dedicated to the fifty who were murdered. 
 This movie is not for those who can't stand cute cuddly creatures, rainbows and lots and lots of sparkly pink colored things.  It was great to see some my little ponies I owned when I was little.  Rosebud, one of the flutter ponies, was one of my favorite toys..It's nice to see them on the big flat screen after all these years.  I have to admit, the song they sing when the baby pony runs away is a bit much, but hey I love the movie anyway. Oh and just to see the bushwillies is totally worth the purchase 
 Like the companion set, Hittin' on All Six (jazz guitar), this collection brings together a wide range of excellent records that date from the earliest jazz recordings going up though early modern. Some of the selections are predictable, some are obscure, but they all are interesting. Lots of Sid Catlett, for example, and excellent choices on the big band side in particular (Cozy Cole, Jimmy Crawford and Jo Jones, to name three). No Lionel Hampton, but the fabulous cymbal beat of Alvin Burroughs with a Hampton small group. And of course, Chick Webb's Liza, which features wonderful drumming but also a really fine trumpet solo by Bobby Stark (the 2nd solo) 
 Frankly I could care less about the children of stars.  But Rain Pryor and her co-author Cathy Crimmins have created a true voice---the voice of a survivor.  This is a story that is heartbreaking and yet in the end heart lifting.  Bravo to Rain for finding her true self while being surrounded by adults who had less sense than children they were "raising".   It's a shame that Rain's mother couldn't open up more and give her authentic story to Rain.  Because she didn't this book becomes the story of a heartbroken defenseless girl who never really gets true authentic consistent love from anyone.  She tries to commit suicide and her father buys her a Nissan?  Hello? (That would be a great scene in a movie)    I love when Rain's mother is upset about the stares that Rain gets as a child and wishes she were wearing a T-shirt that says, Yes, I f----d a black man.   And I absolutely love when Rain says to her father, "Daddy, the whores have to be paid."  (A truly great movie scene)   I wish Rain had had more of a backstage/offstage anecdotal life with her father. (I kept waiting for her to describe being on a movie set with him) Her father was a great artist who was messed up so often on drugs and booze and still created a unique body of work.      From the little window Rain has on her life with Richard I can see that a movie biography of him could be sensational.  Here is a trailblazing hip cool comic who behind closed doors abused himself and physically and mentally abused everyone around him.  Especially women and children.  The scene of him shredding that early film that Rain's mother inspired him to make is just pathetic.  And yet it's amazing that he destroyed his "first" film but then went on to be the most successful black film actor until Denzel Washington or Wil Smith.   
 We are all searching for answers on how to lead a fulfilled life.  The answers are within all of us, but often we look elsewhere to try and find the answers through comparison and material possessions.  I have by no means mastered the lessons taught by James Allen, but can see that with time, patience, and persistance I can be at peace with myself.  This work is greatly enhanced with a goal setting plan.  The combination allows us to create a plan and a framework to live by.  The result is the ability to ultimately construct the fulfilled life we are all searching. This is not a read and put away book.  One really has to think about the messages conveyed 
 This book IS perfect for starting off the school year! Teague is outstanding!   When will the guy win a Caldecott? Every book he does is filled with magnificent illustrations and incredible stories! I met him a  few years ago in California...what a gentleman...ALL CLASS 
 This British film is a stark masterful portrayal of a young working class man, and the urban world he is trapped inside. The black and white  photography lends a honest depiction of his tough bare existence. Colin watches his foolish widowed mother fritter away her meagre inheritance, and he seems to be as incarcerated in this world, as in the reform school he ends up in, after a bungled robbery. His stolen cash, stashed away in a drain pipe at the front door, floats out during a rainy day at the very feet of a detective making inquiries at his house. So it goes for Colin, a man trapped at every turn. His life gets a lift when he joins the cross country team at the reform school. The scenes of him running freely through the woods during meets are poetry on film. Colin lashes out against his fate and lot with one bold pause at the end. His expression as he stands there is priceless. This film's images will last with the viewer for a life time. This is great art 
 Like the rest of the series, I enjoyed this one as much as the first.  The author changes be technique a bit here and uses a lot of Anne's letter, as well as others.  On the other hand, the author sticks to her wonderful style, syntax and story line.  Again, as with other books by L.M. Montgomery, the reader must remember when they were written.  My wife and I have been reading these books for years now and they have lost none of their charm. (As a side note, being a very old man, one might think the romantic aspects of the books might not appeal to me...wrong!  I too, like a couple of the other reviewers was just a wee bit put off by Montgomery's excluding mush the the romantic lines in Anne's letters).  Recommend this one highly.  
 I purchased this book (and three others) to prepare myself and my fiance' for the arrival of our new puppy.  This is the only book of the four I purchased that actually directly addressed how you are supposed to housetrain a puppy when you work and are not home with the dog all day.  All the other books assumed you would be available every two to three hours to take the dog outside, which is, in my opinoin, very unrealistic for most people who work 8 hour or more days and can't hire a pet sitter to stay home with the puppy in their absence.  This book provides detailed schedules for people who are able to be home all day as well as people who can't be with the puppy all day long, allowing you to develop a consistent, realistic program for your puppy regardless of your schedule.  The book was a very quick read (I read it cover to cover in less than a hour), straight-forward, simple to read, and very understandable.  The concepts and principles in this book seem as if they will be easy to implement.  This book made me feel more confident that we will be able to work the puppy into our lifestyle (with a few minor changes) instead of having to overhaul our entire lives to be slaves to the puppy's bowel and bladder.  I strongly recommend this book to other first-time puppy owners who, like us, want to "do it right" and are looking for strategies and solutions they can implement to raise their puppy to be a well-mannered, obedient, and loving dog.   
 This book is a wonderful forgotten gem.  Although it was written nearly half a century before, this book belongs on the shelf next to stories such as Du Maurier's "Rebecca." It is a mystery that takes place at a manor much like Manderly, but the characters are different and the reader wonders who is really the hero (or herione).  Mary Elizabeth Bradden wrote her best for this book.  In fact, the author always thought of this book as her favorite.  I know it is one of mine 
 I enjoy this small book by Herr Doktor Gershom Scholem.  "Zohar : The Book of Splendor : Basic Readings from the Kabbalah" is a collection of passages from the Zohar.  The Zohar is a five volume set which is the central work in the literature of the Kabbalah.  It was written in the late 13th Century CE in Spain.  As such, this little book is much too small to be considered as anything but snippets and favourite passages.  At the same time, I find solace in the meditations.  Like many prayer books, I find it helps to centre myself spiritually as I conform my conscious mind to my faith.  If you are interested in a book of meditations to strengthen a prayer life, this book may be interesting to you 
 I have been a  big Maysa fan since the first day I heard her singing with Incognito years ago, and this CD just really brings out her pure vocal skills and talent.  Maysa has the kind of voice that just sends chills down your spine as soon as she starts singing...it just gets right to your inner soul.  All of these songs are great songs, and Maysa adds her own little style and touch to make each song her own, eventhough many of them have been remade by many other singers in the past.  If you are a fan of great R&B/Soul Music and want to hear an amazing vocal talent, this CD is a great addition to any collection 
 Really this book was a fun read. I laughed out loud a couple of times and that is a good sign, in any book. In her first book Helen Fielding left me with this conviction that, "Oh My God! I'm Bridget Jones". She was righting about me, and I am a single woman, living a world away from London.Really it was(is) a phenomena that had instant success, even before the release of the movies. The Edge of Reason does not dissapoint, its the very same Bridget. And as a self professed Austen fan I enjoyed the tongue -in- cheek allussions to Persuasion. So Miss Fielding, could we persuade you to right another sequal, with wedding bells perhaps 
 Kid: Why do you need a car?  Willie: What the f*** are you talking about?  Kid: This car.  Willie: Which turn is it?  Kid: Sage Terrace. Where's your sleigh?  Willie: It's in the shop, getting repaired.  Kid: Where are the reindeer?  Willie: I stabled them. Is it left or right?  Kid: That way. Where's the stable?  Willie: Next to the shop.  Kid: How do they sleep?  Willie: Who? The reindeer? Standing up.  Kid: But the noise. How do they sleep?  Willie: What noise?  Kid: From the shop.  Willie: They only work during the day, all right?  Kid: I thought it was always night at the North Pole.  Willie: Well, not now. Right now it's always day.  Kid: Then how do they sleep?  Willie: Oh, s***. Sage Terrace. What is it with you, anyway? Somebody drop you on your f***ing head?  Kid: On *my* head?  Willie: Well, yeah. What, are they gonna drop you on somebody else's head?  Kid: How can they drop me onto my own head?  Willie: No, not *onto* your... Would... God damn it! Are you f***ing with me? 
 What can I say? Love it, love it, love it.  Easy to like songs, great vocals, well done job all round.  In particular, Kim No. 1 is fantastic in "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" and Kim No. 2 was also great in "Killing Me Softly"  Throw in the undisputable greats like Clay and Ruben, with a dash of Trenyce and the rousing group anthems, why, you will be "Overjoyed".  Definitely one to add to your collection 
 I didn't participate in law review or any other extracurricular activities.  Since I didn't want to work for a big firm or a judge, I figured my time would be more rationally allocated by reading books on trial and appellate advocacy.  I've read most of F. Lee Bailey's books on how to investigate and try various cases, I've attended several trial skills CLEs, and I've studied the closing arguments of the greats.  I've also read just about everything by Bryan A. Garner.   Thus, going into my last semester of law school, I knew a lot about persuasive and analytical writing, but almost nothing about scholarly writing.  I had avoided "paper classes."  Unfortunately, my desire to take a certain class was outweighed by my aversion to academic writing: I was in a class where the entire grade would be based on one paper.  Thus, I turned to Volokh's Academic Legal Writing.  The date my paper was due severe formatting glitches caused me to lose 4 - 5 pages of text - the guts of one of my "Roman numeral" arguments.  I spend several hours fixing the formatting that could have been spent doing final polishing.  Although able to fix the footnotes, I never recovered that lost text.  Nevertheless, I earned the second-highest grade, missing the top score by only 2 points.  In earning this grade I bested several law review editors, and many of the top 10 students.  Had I not read and employed the principles in Academic Legal Writing, I am confident I would not have done so well.  One principle I learned was to demonstrate to the reader early in the paper why the paper is necessary.  The best way to do this is to show that your paper picks up where another article left off, or that your paper covers an issue previously ignored.  Thus, I began:  "Although the federal bribery statute's scope is sweeping, covering conduct well beyond the "the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action,"  it has been given scant attention.  Legal scholars and political scientists are, in Professor Lowenstein's words, guilty of "sins of omission" for ignoring bribery.   Little has changed since Professor Lowenstein's 1985 article.  Thus, this Article seeks to fill one of the many gaps."  To those of you familiar with scholarly writing, making this point would seem obvious.  But it was not obvious to me.  Volokh's book taught me many things I did not know, and I suspect even experienced writers will learn something worth the investment of time and money in his book.   It's also likely that those of you fluent with academic legal writing learned things piecemeal.  Volokh's work is systematic: You will fill in gaps of our own knowledge.  Go buy a book here 
  Jimmy Nash and Tess Bailey are together again.  Well sort of.  Several months ago, Tess, a computer analyst, helped Nash save his best friend and colleague Decker from a potential hit.  With the adrenaline running high and eyes wide open, Nash and Tess had a one night stand after all was said and done.  Now, they are part of a team sent to Kazbekistan to help recover a laptop with enough information that could put a major dent in the fight against terrorism.  Can these two work together or will their attraction get them killed?  Flashpoint is a fast paced, edge of your seat thriller set in Kazbekistan.  Nash is a bad ass agent who plays hard and works harder.  His nonchalant attitude has gotten him in trouble more than once.  In the case of Tess, his best friend Decker has some feelings for her that Nash either fails to realize or can't resist.  It's an interesting subplot of two friends attracted to the same woman.  At first, I didn't know who I wanted to root for, but as the plot thickened Nash seemed to be the better choice despite his dark side.  He has enough personal issues to fill a book, but with Tess he shows a softer edge.  He begins to care about her as a person rather than a potential lay or fellow agent.  The moments of tenderness he shows made me realize he is a good man.  He just doesn't know how to express himself.  He has been an agent for so long that I don't think he knows how to be anything else.  It's like he doesn't know where his life as an agent ends and he, as a person, begins.  Tess is an awesome computer analyst, but a green field agent.  On her first assignment, she is out of her element.  In Kazbekistan, she sees the worst that reality has to offer but still remains upbeat.  Her optimism was a breath of fresh air even in the darkest times.  I admired her stubbornness and love for Nash because she could see the person he could be under all of the arrogance and attitude.  Yet she would not ask for more than what he could offer.  She would not beg him to love her.  It was all or nothing for her.  Flashpoint is my first Suzanne Brockmann book, but definitely not my last.  The characters are richly detailed and flawed.  Tess, Nash and the secondary characters are real.  Under the harshest conditions, they do and see things that would make a normal person cringe.  I was riveted by the story and all of the subplots that were seamlessly interwoven throughout the book.  Each one helped drive the story, not diminishing the overall storyline.  I could not stop reading because I needed to know what happened next.  I hope each of the secondary characters will have their own story because they are so fascinating.  Flashpoint is a wonderful thriller that will keep you riveted until the last page.   Lee Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewe 
 This book is amazing..I am so glad I bought it..It has lots and lots of info very useful for new special ed parents or seasoned ones...Highly recommend anything by these authors!!! Buy it!! 
 If you are looking for a book with all the same press shots you've seen a thousand times then this book isn't for you.  The panoramic composits are excellent and the choice of photos is very intelligent.  See what Apollo was really about in this book.  The quality in terms of photo reproduction and book design is impeccable 
 This 2001 sex comedy delivers the goods. It is very funny especially with its gross out humor bits. You will laugh from beginning to end. The acting in the movie is pretty good. And the beautiful Shannon Elizabeth looks so hot as she usually does. This movie is great fun and will have you wanting more 
 Island is the first Laymon book I have read.  I bought it well over a year ago and finally got around to it.  I enjoy H.P. Lovecraft, Richard Matheson, Jack Ketchum and some Stephen King stuff so I figured I would give Richard Laymon a try and Island promised to be pretty scary...  The high points of this novel are the pacing and atmosphere.  It really did creep me out--I actually had my front door open for the nice breeze and at one point actually did get up, close and lock it while reading Island.  It DID deliver on chills and thrills.    The low point of Island, to me anyway, is the seemingly irrational and/or unrealistic actions and reactions of the characters.  This is especially annoying in a book that does not involve any kind of fantastic or supernatural elements, I mean we are supposed to be reading about something that would not be impossible to imagine even if it is improbable yet some of the interactions between characters are borderline ridiculous.  Part of the effect of the book was initially lost on me due to some of the dialogue and certain aspects of the character(s) personalities, one of them in particular.  What I didn't realize until afterward is that there may have been a reason for this character to act this way or have thoughts that seem outrageous to me given the circumstances.  Either way, despite some of the silliest moments, this book was very difficult to put down and I was most certainly dying to know what was going to happen next; it's truly a page-turner and I had to actively stop myself from skipping ahead to take a peek at pages to come.  Immediately upon finishing Island I was going to give it three stars.  However I ended up sleeping on it and am giving the book a solid four stars for one particular reason: I predicted ultimately how it would end, I was right, yet it still got under my skin.  I have been thinking about the book for a couple of days now, can't seem to get it out of my head, and it creeped me out enough to make me force myself to take a break from horror books for a week or two.    I pretty much had a feeling of what might happen in the end but it was one of those things where I thought to myself that maybe I was wrong because it didn't seem to be going that way at all.  Ultimately my prediction was correct and although I would have liked to see just a little more build up to the conclusion rather than the abruptness it had (in my opinion), it certainly sealed the deal in terms of my being able to label this book "creepy" and it most certainly was the factor that keeps this novel burned into my brain.  
 This book is very detailed in its thesis and the conclusions drawn are right on the nose, so to speak.  It is color illustrated with excellently written text with plentiful examples extant in Egypt and other countries throughout the world.  I highly recommend it.  It is a good reference book also for any library or personal library 
 I have been trying for YEARS to find this "Clownhouse" movie.  It is such a hoot to watch, but also has some really creepy scenes that make your hair stand on end.  Clowns have always given me the creeps, my entire life, and this movie can really scare someone like me!  I watched it with a group of people, and all of us would jump at parts here and there.  No sci fi or special effects in this movie, just a good "really could happen" horror movie.  What fun!!!  This is one of those old movies that you know you will watch over and over for years.  
 Why dig this record?? Well, if you're into Bowie, into Idol (Check the "Thin White Duke"-ish baritone vocals...) , and have a sweet tooth for slightly over-produced non-metal 80's hard rock , this  cd's for you. Most of us know Charlie plays lead guitar for Bob Dylan now..what most people don't know is when he signed to MCA for this album in the mid-80's he was paid the most ever for an "unknown"  (millions) and he was only 17. Sexton became a victim of what mainly the critics attacked him with...he was a "HYPE". But listen to this record today and you'll know....the talent is considerable....the songs are for real, and the soul is THERE.  Dylan was already a fan before the record was released (Check out "Biograph"  liner notes). Too bad the critics /cynics put the lights out on this one before Charlie got the chance he deserved....A++++ 
 I love the All In The Family episodes.  I enjoyed all of these shows on the first run starting in the 70's.  The show explored a lot of subjects that were pretty much "taboo" when I was growing up.  People only hear about Archie and his bigotry.  I don't think that many people really sit down and watch the shows and realize that Archie was a product of the times.  All that he learned was basically learned at home.  Carroll O'Connor was a comic genius and he "made" Archie be the success that he was.  I purchased Season Five to add to the first four seasons.  My complaints are that after Season Two - the DVD's no longer have spanish subtitles.  The other complaint is that it takes a long time for each season to be put out for purchase 
 I live within 50 miles of Skidmore, Mo. I was 12 years old when the shooting happened.I remember watching scenes from Skidmore on Channel 2 news out of St. Joseph Mo the day of the shooting.   The book tells the story quite well. If you have a picturesque mind, what you imagine as you read is how the town really looks. I have friends from Skidmore that were affected by Ken Rex one way or another and to this day if they know who did it they don't say a word.  That's what makes rural America different from the big city. Justice will be done using the civil system or your own 
 Looks like plenty of other people have logged in to either gush wildly about Mika, or complain bitterly about his last concert (rather than the recording in question).  As someone old enough to actually remember when Queen and Freddie Mercury were new instead of retro, I don't know if I agree with all the comparisons being made here.  Mika's clearly masterful at constructing seamless, highly polished pop, with a flexible, wide-ranging voice, and an ability to invent hooks that embed in your brain and stick.  That's not an easy thing to do: good bubblegum is not that easy to construct.  This music is a confection, and as delightful (and nearly addictive) as candy.  But I also hear a darker current in these songs: the "admirer" who keeps calling and calling on the phone, the person who prompts the line "I don't care if I ever talk to you again," the ex who is encouraged to take that unfortunate emotional phone message he didn't mean to leave and "Erase" it, and the genuinely despondent "Happy Ending," all indicate that the "Love" that "everybody" is in today has its problems.  I look forward to Mika's ongoing development as a songwriter.  
 I gave this to my nephew for his birthday--hold lots of pics and videos (at least 250 pics).  I wouldn't say it ever cost as much as the "marked down" price, but was a savings for the same capacity card at the discount retail stores--about $15 cheaper.  I am pleased. 
 I love it so much, and bought three CDs for my friends, they all love it 
 This book in the series finds Amelia Bedelia and her employers going camping...as always Amelia's literal minded approach means lots of misunderstanding between what the Rodger's tell her to do and what Amelia does.  As always, Amelia Bedelia does EXACTLY as she is told (let's hit the road leaves Amelia hitting the road with a stick and I think we can all guess what happens when it's time to pitch the tent)!!  In the end, its Amelia's big heart (and extraordinary cooking ability) that saves the day (as usual) when the Rodger's get fed up with all the misunderstandings!!  Young readers will love to hear this story read out loud, but it's also a find book for readers just starting out!  Amelia, I think, will be around for generations to come, the stories are simple, but hilarious and the illustrations are just darling!  Always a good way to get a discussion going about how we use words and how a word or phrase can have several meanings...plus it's just plain fun!  
 This book is aamazing because it goes from a girl meeting a boy who she likes, but doesn't know if he likes her to a romantic ti in Paris where the end up being together. This book can inspire a lot of teenagers to express their feelings for someone that ends up liking them but they didn't know it at first. Sarra Manning keep making great teenage love books!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Although I may be a little prejudice, I have a recipie listed in the book, I think this is must reading for anyone who delights in the Martini!  From "Top Shelf" right on to "Happy Hour" a sheer joy to  read!  Thanks to Anistatia R. Miller and Jared Brown for creating a great  piece of work.  It's always available here at my "home" bar and  everyone who picks it up and glances through it at "gatherings"  is delighted 
 I have used this cookbook a lot and have very much enjoyed the results.  I recommend you try the sweet potato and black bean burrito.  Fantastic! 
 this is an excelent version.  if you want to see Dennis in his prime, this is the way to do it.  sit back have a smoke and a beer and laugh your ass off 
 The negative reviewer who calls Satanists "bozos" and pitches a "Christian" alternative doesn't seem to have read this book. I'm not surprised. That reviewer seems to lack a sense of humor. I picked this up after seeing the movie SATANIS abut the Church of Satan and having a blast. The Secret Life of a Satanist is another enjoyable work influenced by Anton LaVey. I loved reading this. Very entertaining, interesting, and fun. It's a hell of a read! 
 In my opinion, this CD is not as good as "The Anatomy Of The Tongue In Cheek," but then again, few pop-punk CD's are.  This CD kind of moves them into more of emo/pop punk sound, which still really works for Relient K.  Thiessen still has an excellent singing voice and he still writes witty songs with great wordplay.  His balance of serious and funny songs reward the listener with a great overall CD.  Some of my favorites are: The One I'm Waiting For, Be My Escape, I So Hate Consequences, Which To Bury Us Or The Hatchet, Let It All Out, and Who I Am Hates Who I've Been.  The maturity on this album is showing that Relient K has a great future ahead of them, although punk rock isn't as big as used to be.  So Relient K, who does not put out bad albums, should be a band to watch for in the next five years to see how much more they will develop and adapt 
 Tau Malachi brings St. Mary Magdalene to vivid life in this book, which contains teachings of his Sophian Gnostic lineage that have previously only been transmitted orally.  Although I've read quite a bit on the Magdalene, this book makes me feel as though I've been brought into her presence in a way few others have.  Highly recommended 
 I stopped smoking on February 22, 2006 (but who is counting). I still have some cravings, but then I crave pasta, wine and chocolate, which I can eat/drink in moderation -- but as most smoker's know, smoking in moderation never seems to work. Thank you Allen Carr; you changed my life 
      Quite honestly, if you are comfortable with who you are (introverted/extroverted, whatever); then you obviously do not need to read "Party of One". If you are content and accepting of yourself as a "loner", this book is not for you.  However, if you are like me, and have spent your ENTIRE life thinking that there was something "wrong" with you because you simply prefer solitude over social interaction...then this book may change the way you feel (in a good way) about your personality. It may make you sigh with relief, "Oh my God, I am NOT the only one who feels this way. I am not a damaged person who needs to be "fixed"!  For years I have researched all kinds of social disorders, trying to find out what type of "problem" I have.  But none of them (antisocial personality, social anxiety, avoidant personality, schizoid, sociopath, shy, introvert, etc) defined ME.  This book helped me see that I have none of those mental health issues; and in fact, I am a completely normal person who just prefers to be alone.  I am now comfortable with my loner traits.     Loners are most energetic, creative, productive, happy and alive, etc. when they are by themselves. They get physically and mentally exhausted when in social situations (just as extroverts get 'energized' from them!) They don't need a therapist to "help" them.  They are not angry at society; they don't hate anyone; they empathize with the human race; they cry at heartbreaking news stories on TV; they have friends and family whom they love very much...        It's just the way their brains are "wired"...period. In most cases, healthy loners come from at least one parent who has/had loner 'traits'. They were simply born this way.       Who CARES about the grammar problems, sometimes "dry", "biting" writing style of the author, or the redundant topics! (as others have noted in their reviews).  And for those of you who commented about how "angry" the author seemed to be at all the non-Loners/extroverts of the world...I truly believe that she was just trying to create a feeling of normalcy, of relief, of solidarity for THOSE OF US who have felt like Freaks and Wierdos all of our lives.  Plus, she obviously, as a loner herself, has experienced deep pain (loners, who make up a minority of the human population, are often looked at as "Strange", no doubt!)  Coming to terms with herself as a loner in life's journey has sometimes generated 'angry' reflections on her part.  Nothing wrong with that!             If you are searching, like I was, for an explanation of your INNATE loner personality (or the personality of a spouse, child, parent, friend, etc...); YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.  It may finally make you feel at peace with yourself.  Maybe you'll stop beating yourself up; and stop looking for a mental health "diagnosis".         This book has changed my life.  Good Luck to all fellow 'loners'... 
 I love Hercule Poirot! He is the most complex detective. Everyone else is utterly baffled and M. Poirot has everything figured out in his "little grey cells", and who could forget about Miss Marple? She  is the queen of mystery and Hercule Poirot is the king! If these two were  to work together then no evil mastermind could win. Miss Marple is as great  as Dorothy Gilman's Mrs. Pollifax. Her cunning outsmarts us all. I just  LOVED this book 
 Talk about an entertaining read for children! I have all of her books. This is great educational material for your children, and it should definitely be part of their library. At first, I thought this was just for kids. I landed up loving her books. It's very interesting. Less TV, and more of this stuff for children 
 Ill Wind is the third mystery written by Nevada Barr featuring U.S. Park Ranger Anna Pigeon. After solving murders in Track of the Cat and A Superior Death, Anna is now working as a Ranger in the Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado. She is in her forties, a widow, has a little bit of a late night drinking problem, but is passionate and skilled in what she does as a Park Ranger. Ill Wind starts out without revealing the primary mystery of the novel. The possible bad guys are all presented first, though some of them do not seem very bad. Anna is called to get involved in a domestic dispute because in the Park the Rangers have to act as police, but this is not a novel about a domestic dispute. Is this storyline misdirection or is there something else going on? When a young girl dies up on the Cliffs because she can't breathe the assumption is that it is her asthma and being up at 7000 feet. Then another death. Finally a third. Anna figures out the timing of the deaths and starts investigating.  The thing about having a Park Ranger as the heroine of a novel is that the setting will always be part of the story. It matters that this story is set in Mesa Verde just as the settings of the two previous mysteries mattered. It is park of the story and wrapped up in the story and it allows Nevada Barr to give very scenic and natural descriptions and get murders out of the city and into a completely different environment, which in turn gives these books a completely different feel than one might expect from a urban murder mystery. Barr tells the story well and while she may have tipped her hand early, I know I did not pick up on the true culprit. That's a positive because up until the Reveal I felt that nearly anyone could be at fault.  A good, reasonably short mystery.  -Joe Sherr 
 No doubt about it, John Muir was one of America's greatest citizens.  He founded the Sierra Club and was instrumental in starting the ecological movement in the United States.  In this book Muir recounts three journeys to Southeast Alaska that he took in the late 1800's.  He writes better about glaciers than any writer who ever lived.  There are flaws: Muir's attitudes about native peoples are simple-minded and ignorant, and his prose is sometimes dry and dull.  Also, one cannot help but call Muir's credibility into question when he writes than he and his dog Stickeen walked fifteen miles across a crevasse-riddled glacier in three hours and then had nothing for dinner but a moldy cracker.  But these are important records from a man who truly loved the natural world, and it's essential reading material for anyone traveling to Southeast Alaska or anyone wishing to learn more about glaciers 
 Was able to easily teach myself to crochet with this book.  It is fun and funny too! 
 While at the MoMA I happened across the Chuck Close exhibit. I had heard of him, but had never seen his work. As I walked through the exhibit I thought to myself, "big deal, a bunch of 9 foot tall photographs." But when I notice the medium was acrylic I was astonded! This book captures the unbelievable talent of this amazing artist. It shows his the vast array of materials he used from paint, to pieces of paper. i would highly recommend buying this book! It is one of my favorites 
 I already knew, having given it to my two-year-old neighbor, what a great book this is, but I was not prepared for what a perfect baby book it can be. When I read the hardcover version to my seven-month-old granddaughter, she held very still and seemed to anticipate each rereading. The traditional story itself is baby-fare, with billy goat voices in three sizes and the fun repetition of "trip-trap, trip-trap", but some of Galdone's illustrations of large and clearly defined faces are appealing to babies too. When I visited my now ten-month-old amazing grandbaby, her mom told me this is her favorite book and she reads it to her almost every night. While I was reading it to her, every time we came to the full-page picture of the billy goat's face, she leaned down and put her cheek against the paper 
 Tuck everlasting is a book that is about fantasy and everlasting life. I liked how the book was about everlasting life and how Natalie Babbitt always mentioned light and sunshine.  My favorite quote in Tuck Everlasting is, "Don't be afraid of death but be afraid of the unlived life." This is my favorite quote because the main idea is living a good life then a long one.  Natalie Babbitt was always a fantastic drawer when she was young. Therefore she wanted to be a children's book writer and draw pictures for them. So she told her husband to write her a story, so she could draw the pictures for her first children's book. I recommend this book to other grade fives and up. 
 I was just reading the press release issued by the Nobel committee in '82 and I couldn't help remembering the sense of magical (yet tragic) surrealism that permeates through his writing.. the past, the present and the future all come together in an incredible, liquid mosaic that's simply mesmerizing. Both '100 years of solitude' and 'love in the time of cholera' are vivid and oh-so-alive. The historical feuds that have shaped the landscape of LatAm and the political, social turmoil of today all flow together as one surreal, mystic river and Marquez navigates the river like no one else

 This is an awesome book and should be read by anyone that either has young children or is considering starting a family. It covers everything from how your feelings toward each other may change to getting sex back into your  marriage. My wife and I have given this book to many of our pregnant  friends and plan to keep copies on hand for just such occasions. We loved  the book and know anyone that reads it will enjoy it and understand better  what impact your child will have on your life 
 If you commit to it, it is one of the most amazing pieces of writing you will ever read. Many a delicious quotable niblet 
 Antonia Fraser, David Starkey and Alison Weir wrote books on the six ladies who were (un)lucky enough to marry Henry VIII of England. And while Starkey's & Fraser's books are a delight I think the definite version is that of Tudor veteran Alison Weir. Written in an engaging & yet professional style you are caught up in the world of Tudor England. I especially loved the chapters on Anne Boleyn and Katherine of Aragon. This also includes several pages of pictures & illustrations which are an amazing addition to the fabulous read provided by this book. Buy it, read it & enjoy 
 The exemplary companion album to a PBS television series, this features a wide range of Appalachian folk music, from stark, spooky "shape note" gospel singing to plunky old-time tunes and greased lightning bluegrass, with story songs and spirituals, murder ballads and laments for lost love -- all the styles and sentiments that make American mountain music so weird and wonderful and emotionally resonant.  Many of the major players are on here: Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family (and June Carter Cash, keeping the tradition alive); bluegrassers like Mac Wiseman, David Grisman and the Osborne Brothers; old-school folkies like Jean Ritchie and Depression-era balladeers such as the Blue Sky Boys and Blind Alfred Reed, and even a few young'uns like Jeff Black and Jason Ringenberg to round things out... It's a nice set that spans the 20th Century and gives a well-rounded view of the rich musical heritage of a region that helped shape American popular culture 
 I just got through with a two-day training session with Mr. Siegel, and I have to tell you, his class was awesome and so was this book.  Everything you need to get going with Captivate 2 is here....from how to get started with a simple movie, to creating images, screen captions, adding 508 compliance and closed captioning, to mounting it on the Web.  Everything you need to get started is here.  I really like the way the book steps everything out in clear, precise language that can be understood by all.  Mr. Siegel also gave some handy tips in the class about prior planning and preparation that is needed to make Captivate projects look their best.  I would highly recommend this title to someone starting out, and as a great accompaniment to the manual that comes with the software.  Way to go, Kevin 
 this album was good from beginning to end.it silenced the critics that hadnt shut up in years,he made a really good album ending his slump of so so  albums.he segued from  the hippie/folkster into the burned out genius we loved from the 60s only now it was the 90s.the album was an important bridge in his career and the most listenable album since nashville skyline.32 years earlier 
   This may be a longer essay than many may be used to reading, but it is worth reading! It is brilliant! That is practically the only word I can describe it by. Some of her best work/thoughts and quotes on literature is in this essay. If you are a fan of Virginia Woolf, you must read this. If you are just starting to read her writings, this is a great introducion to her work. If anything it will make you want to read more of her writings( which is exactly what happened to me after I read this!)  
 I read this book as the assigned text for a course in Quantitative Analysis and found it to be an excellent text for such a class.  Each Model and equation presented is explained through realistic examples, illustrations, and explanations of the math.  This made the subject very easy to comprehend and apply to the real world.   Exercises at the end of each chapter are also based on real-world situations and case studies are included in the book and the CD that go into more detail about a real world use for each model.  The book was also easy to read and not overly technical when explaining mathematic concepts.  An excellent text for an introduction to the field of management science 
 I purchased this in Cobalt Blue. It goes with my Fiestaware dishes, as well as my Pzaltsgraf and Longerberger Pottery. I also agree that the color and glaze are beautiful, and much nicer in person than online. It has a large capacity, and pleasing lines. I'll most likely purchase an additional one in another color for larger holiday meals, to be able to use more than one 
 The characters are fantastic, intriguing and real.  No lapses in the storytelling, it captures the reader and you're drawn in.  It is an amazing tale of Evil vs. Good told in terms of fantasy, reality, romance and magic.  Also, both Morrigan's Cross and Dance of the God's have some great humor, subtle, but makes for pleasure. Nora Roberts really bought her best to the reader in this Trilogy.  I finished the Book Two tonight "Dance of the Gods" Book Three will be coming soon in the mailbox.  But until then this is a story that does not leave the mind.  Rather it a story that is spellbinding, entertaining and evokes continued enjoyment.  Truly a wonderful yarn. The writing is without lags and snags and binds into a splendid tale 
 Philip Yancey is my favorite Christian author.  He's always asking the hard questions--questions we're all thinking, but are often afraid to ask for fear of sounding "faithless."  He also encourages us to think biblically and to pray before giving inane or insensitive "advice" to friends and family who are experiencing suffering.  I've been leading a middle-school/high-school-aged girls' small group Bible study based upon this book.  The girls have really appreciated the study as most have been touched, in some way, by tragedy and suffering. As they look at the world, they often ask, "Why?" They want to talk about the tough questions of life, sans platitudes.    I'd read the book years ago and have appreciated this updated version (he revisits some of those about whom he wrote, e.g. Joni Earackson Tada).  Shortly after starting the study, my 72-year-old mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  Boy, did I need a refresher on God's character and grace.    
 Before purchasing this Wacom, I did a lot of research and decided it was probably worth a few extra bucks to get one with a good reputation. I have no complaints. I can't complain about the size because I knew what 4" X 5" amounted to before I bought it. The clicker on the pen takes a little getting used to, but what doesn't? Like the title says, it's just what I was hoping for 
 I have read several books on music history but none has been such a delicious read as this.  This book traces the history of the person responsible for the side-splitting humor in some of Mozart's best operas.  I agree with the other reviews on the Amazon.com website.  A beautifully researched and crafted book that makes a real person's life read like a wonderful novel.  
 I JUST saw this band open for another act this past weekend, and I am in LOVE!  They put on a great show, the lead singer is very talented, as are the other members of the band, clever and witty.  The music is very catchy and I can't stop listening to it...I have been listening to the same cd in my car for the past 4 days and also listening to it online at work!  If you get a chance to see them live, do it 
 This book is hilarious.   If you've ever travelled Europe or wanted to this book puts you into the passenger's seat. One of his earlier works, Bryson has the uncanny ability to distill what's funny about a people, place or situation and stamp his own brand of humour on it.  I've read all his books, I reckon this is 'Bryson's Best' to date. 
 A cross between Lawrence humor and Hitchcock suspence.  Martin plays the "playa" and uses his comedic style to provide the humor.  This time there is less of the absurbed humor than in some of his previous movies.  The Hithcock suspense is Lynne Whitfield's character.  How many ways will she make the man pay and in the end to what degree does the playa learn his lesson.  For the Martin Lawrence fan there is no disappointment. Maybe his best to date 
 This book is another page-turner.  I so enjoy the Emersons when they are right in the thick of things.  This book is a little different though because there appears to be two parallel stories at first, and the older Emersons are in Cairo following one thread, and the two younger Emersons are in Luxor following another thread.  But of course they end up investigating together, and that iw when the fun begins.  It's nice to see Ramses and Nefret in their newly-wed bliss.  Let me tell you, Indiana Jones has nothing on our Ramses.  But Emerson and his Amelia are no slouches either.  We also see a new and more emotional Amelia and that is a good thing.  She does her utmost to keep her son away from harm in this book and neither of them have gotten over his harrowing escape from death in the last book.  But there's still lots of danger, tomb-robbing and deaths in this one and it's such a great deal of fun getting to the bottom of it with these four amazing people 
 I think that John Lennon is a genius.  I wish I had the money to buy all of his books. I love how he plays with the language. He is truely going to live on forever. I recommend this book to anyone who loves things to think  about and even if you don't just for the fun of it 
 I got this book after being diagnosed with ADD at 51.  Except for medication - I had already figured out most of the adaptations recommended in the book.  But it was an eye opener for me and my family, parents included, and very healing.  I do think that there needs to be an updated forward about the biological basis (low levels of dopamine) and even evolutionary basis of ADD.  To paraphrase Will Durant - most vices were at some point in human history virtues or at least required for survival.  I wonder how many people who were the great explorers and warriors of history had ADD 
 I have both disc in the series.  I liked the music on this disc much more than the first.  The selections seem more focused and the sounds are much clearer.  Also, the particular pieces fit better together.  I love the sound of this group and hope they make more in the future 
 This historical novel is based on facts of the late 16th and early 17th century rule of the Mughal Empire in India.  The main character, Mahrunnisa, was real - a woman who married the Emperor when she was no longer young, and who then ruled the Empire with him.  The story is sweeping and romantic.     To be honest, I read the first 50 pages of the book and decided not to read any more.  It seemed formulaic at first.  And I also have a politically correct streak in me about books always being written about empires rather than common people.  And so I put the book in my give-away pile.  Then I went to sleep and when I woke up I was thinking about the story.  And so, I raced home that evening, picked up the book, and read another 150 pages at once, gobbling the book up in big chunks until I had thoroughly read and enjoyed all 396 pages.   What a book!  What a story!  What an interesting history lesson!   The Mughal Empire was so vast and so rich that it was inevitable that there would be lots of in-fighting for the throne.  The Empire had a harem but only one of his sons could be Emperor.  Competition was ugly.  Wars were fought.  Lives were lost.  There was splendor and love and plain old fashioned good storytelling with the violence real but understated, as was the romance.  I was totally captivated.   I loved it the book so much I am ordering the sequel.  Can't wait to read it 
 A book of nested storylines, The Blind Assassin is the story of two sisters: one dies suddenly, and the survivor tells their stories. The surviving sister, Iris Chase Griffin, writes down her life story through commentary on her daily life and reflections back to her childhood; interspersed are newspaper clippings and abstracts from her sister Laura Chase's posthumous novel The Blind Assassin in which an upper-class woman falls in love with a blue-collar man who tells her a science-fiction story whenever they meet. The complex narrative structure makes for a slow build up of plot but ultimately a rich, complex, and meaningful portrait of the Chase family and the events that lead to the downfall of the family name and Laura's suspect death. As always, Atwood is an accomplished author: she manages to make the book's complex, convoluted narrative structure work and writes characters that are gritty and realistic at the same time that they are complex and larger than life. The plot unfolds in natural but dynamic turns that make for engrossing reading, and Atwood's approach to her characters mixes cynicism and empathy in such a way that their stories are realistic, meaningful, and entirely unromanticized. By the end, The Blind Assassin is a realistic but dramatic story about two women's lives in which they are both powerful and powerless, in which they both leave a legacy and are forgotten.  The book's complex narrative structure can make it very difficult to get into. Four stories run concurrently (Iris's present, Iris's past, The Blind Assassin love story, and the sci-fi story within The Blind Assassin), and the newspaper clippings compliment both of Iris's stories. With so much going on, the book is slow to start and initially very confusing. About a third of the way through, the connections between the storylines start to make sense; about two-thirds of the way through, the stories begin to feed into each other in a way that is suspenseful and exciting. The reader that feels confused or frustrated by the text is best advised to push through and not worry if things don't seem to make sense. Eventually, things will come together, and the payoff of the confusing, complex narrative structure is an ending that is dramatic, suspenseful, and truly rewarding.  The Blind Assassin is one of Atwood's more recent novels, and while she has always been an accomplished writer this book is also the product of experience and improvement. She manages the narrative structure well, keeping the numerous plotlines alive and also bringing them to a very strong resolution, one that makes perfect sense once you get there but requires narrative complexity to get to. Furthermore, Atwood manages to look at a number of big issues that are difficult to pin down in a way that provides insight without being overwhelming or obvious. In some of her earlier works (The Edible Woman,  The Handmaid's Tale) the issues at hand overwhelm the book or are glaringly forthright. In The Blind Assassin, on the other hand, the issues at hand compliment and enrich the text without being overwhelming or even obvious. Atwood explores issues such as power v. powerlessness in women and the differences between appearances/communication and the truth. These concepts provide food for thought, make the text both terrifying and inspiring, and yet don't seem obvious or moralized. The balance between the art of storytelling and the inclusion of major issues indicates skillful writing on Atwood's part and makes for a book that is both enjoyable and meaningful.  I highly recommend this text. It can take some time to get in to, but it is skillfully written, meaningful, enjoyable, and gets richer and more exciting as it goes on. Atwood is an accomplished writer, and her books only seem to get better. Pick up a copy of this book--I promise you won't be disappointed 
 J.A. Jance is back in form with this J.P. Beaumont gem.  There is a new partner to work with, grisly murders to solve, nazi war criminals and  helicopter chases.  What more could you want 
 Although I found a lot of this book to be useful, I was most impressed with the author's system to conserve fuel and speed cooking time while cooking outdoors in colder climates 
 I've been very happy with this strap.  It's not as thick as the ones used in class, it's perfectly adequate for home use.  Love it 
 I was a fresh graduate looking for a job in the software development field. My university career services office gave me a library worth of reading material. It proved to be useless at my first interview - I bombed. It wasn't that I didnt know programming, it was that I wasn't prepared for the type of questions that would be asked. I was looking for questions like "what are your career goals" and the question I got was "write a function to turn an integer into a string and vice versa." I found this book on amazon, bought it and studied it from cover to cover, did all the programming exercises by myself, tried solving all the puzzles before I looked up the answers. The result, I landed my first job within a week. At the interview, one of the questions they asked me came straight from this book, one of the questions was slightly similar but much harder, and one question was completely different but by using the thought process listed in the book it was a piece of cake. The verdict: Buy this book. It is invaluable. It is very well written. It is very relevant. It teaches you how to approach programming problems and various puzzles. The authors come off as very smart people. The best thing about this book is that after presenting a problem it doesnt give you an answer right away. It leads you into the problem just as you would naturally solve a problem. The result is that once you have read a problem, you can try and solve it, or you can read a couple of lines and it gives you a hint in the right direction. Even if you have to read the complete text of the problem, the coded answer comes last so you can still try your hand at it before you look at the final code. This is an amazing book 
 If you really want to know Rothko, read Dore Ashton.  Breslin tends to simplify things and I don't think that he really loves Rothko or has communicated with the paintings. Only for die-hard Rothkoites like me 
 Brings back sureal memories. Made me want to find some old friends. Great for running. You can almost feel like you're there again 
 I love all the quilting books this author writes. I hope she keeps the stories coming 
 This is one of the best teaching book for chemical engineering students, clear and objective in its content 
 As those who listened will tell you, if you heard Jean Shepherd on the radio, you will never have forgotten him.  Not a biography, but with biographical information, Eugene Bergmann does a tremendous job presenting the career of Shep and the many facets and phases of his work.  It's a book you can pick out any page, start reading, and become totally absorbed.  A great effort.  Excelsior!    
 The item I ordered was in better condition than described for a used book 
 This book was an eye opener.  To define the Biblical fact that people are responsible for accepting Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and also Christians are responsible to harold (evangelize)Jesus so that all can make that decision.  All this in parallel with the Biblical fact that God is sovereign over all.  This was at first difficult to accept then as I read further and the Holy Spirit stimulated my faith, I was able to accept this mystery and see my place in the process. What a great book!  I would (and have) recommend it to pastors and laymen on both sides of the discussion.  
 Primo Levi's description of his internment at auschwitz was very interesting for certain.  He doesn't paint the picture of his time at Auschwitz with broad strokes, but rather is very specific so that you understand the day to day life of the people there.    The chapters I found most intrigueing were the descriptions in the first few chapters about the journey to the camp, and then the chapter entitled "10 days" about their freedom regained.  This is a book for someone who wants to get down to the specifics of the trajedy that was the holocos 
 Rife with nineteenth century melodrama and a plot riddled by coincidence, Rafael Sabatini's SCARAMOUCHE is a tale of passion and adventure on the eve of the French Revolution. Andre-Louis Moreau, a low born young man who has studied the law and enjoys the patronage of a local nobleman, M. de Kercadiou, falls afoul of yet another highborn gentleman when this other takes it upon himself to entice Andre-Louis' best friend into a duel he cannot win. Moreau's friend, Philippe de Vilmorin, is a hotheaded idealist preaching the overthrow of the established order and his highborn antagonist, the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr, is a man who cannot abide that. Goading the hapless Philippe into a one-sided duel which must result in his death, the Marquis ultimately refuses to respond to the angry demand of Andre-Louis that he kill him, too, leaving the young man clutching the dead body of his friend and swearing to become the voice of revolution that Philippe would have been had he lived.  Aiming to make good his oath, Andre-Louis soon turns his talent for oratory into rabblerousing against the Marquis, and those of the King's officers who protect him, and is forced to become a fugitive as the established order turns against him. Fleeing the gendarmes with the aid of Aline, beautiful niece of M. de Kercadiou, Andre-Louis joins an acting troupe and begins the first significant transformation of his life. But it will not be his last as he finds his calling in playing the scandalous rogue "Scaramouche" in the series of plays he soon devises to win fame and fortune for his little troupe.  Yet trouble haunts the troupe as Andre-Louis discovers a passion for Mademoiselle Binet, the beautiful daughter of the troupe's leader, only to find his hopes thwarted when he again crosses paths with the deadly Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr. Angered at the decision of M. de Kercadiou's niece, Aline, to refuse to foreswear the attentions of the ubiquitous Marquis, who seeks to win her with his worldly wealth and gentlemanly charm, Scaramouche soon resurfaces as a political dissident once more, bringing to an end his love affair with the theater and the actress, La Binet, who first drew him to it.  But Andre-Louis still has another transformation before him and, fleeing to Paris, he secures a position with a fencing master and is soon well on his way to mastery of that still vital martial art. As the Revolution gains steam, Andre-Louis, who continues to see himself as the rogue, Scaramouche, finds himself sucked back into the maelstrom of disorder and violence that the conflict in France is fast becoming. When, at last, he learns of an opportunity to square accounts with the man who slaughtered his friend, tempted Kercadiou's niece, and derailed his own planned marriage with the lovely Binet girl, he is quick to act and is soon brought face to face with d'Azyr in the Assembly of the newly formed French constitutional monarchy.  But the constitutional monarchy cannot endure and little else is as it seems in the escapades of Scaramouche. If one surprise is amply telescoped there is yet another, waiting in the wings, which comes so suddenly that I was astonished I had not anticipated it. Of course, the tale is entirely derived of the magnificent coincidences, nineteenth century style, that keep the story boiling as M. Moreau, the Scaramouche, learns the secrets of his own history, one revelation at a time.  If you like good old fashioned historical action tales with a French flavor and have a tolerance for the archaic conventions that enriched Sabatini's writing in the period (he wrote in the early twentieth century though his style resounds with the accouterments of the nineteenth), then I'm betting you'll like this one. I did.  SWM   
 I came across this book at the recommendation of an Orthodox nun, who wanted to give me an idea of what cloistered life is like, how nuns live and struggle, and are basic human beings - just like everyone else.  Once I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down, and devoured it almost in one week!  I enjoyed reading it so much, that once I'd finished, I turned it to the beginning and started reading it again! (My family thought I was nuts as I sat reading it whilst sitting on the beach.  When they asked me why I was reading it for a second time, I exclaimed I didn't have anything else with me, to which my Dad just rolled his eyes and said, "I could have given you the newspaper!")  I'd chose Brede over the newspaper any day.  This is a charming book, whose characters are very realistic.  The interwoven stories are compelling, and it makes one sad when you read the last page.  If only there was a continuation, a sequel - what happened to Dame Phillipa once she left?  "Where did she go?" you ask?  I'll leave that to your imagination - unless you read the book for yourself.  You will thoroughly enjoy the story regardless of who or what you are, whether Christian or not.  I can guarantee it will remain in your memory and heart for years to come.  Happy reading, dear people! 
 In October, 1859, a small group of young Republican leaders in New York City invited Abraham Lincoln to give an address at Henry Beecher's church in Brooklyn on a subject of Lincoln's choosing.  At the time, Lincoln was heavily involved in helping Republican Congressional candidates, was still smarting from his 1858 defeat for the Senate by Stephen Douglas, and was a dark-horse, favorite son for the Republican presidential nomination. Lincoln accepted the invitation, worked painstakingly on the speech, and travelled to New York City to deliver what became the Cooper Union Address on February 27, 1860. (Lincoln was unaware that the venue for the speech had been changed until he arrived in New York.)  The speech and its aftermath brought Lincoln national attention.  It played a major role in allowing Lincoln to overtake the Republican front-runner, Senator William Seward of New York, and secure the nomination and the presidency.  Harold Holzer is an independent scholar who, in the midst of a busy career at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has written or edited over twenty books about Lincoln.  His most recent book: "Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that made Abraham Lincoln President" (2004) is a comprehensive account of the "momentous" Cooper Union Address, including (p. 1) "its impetus, preparation, delivery, reception, publication, calculated reiteration, and its enormous, perhaps decisive impact on that year's presidential campaign." It is one of a number or recent books that examine in detail a specific Lincoln speech or proclamation, (such at the Gettysburg Address, Second Inaugural Address, Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln-Douglas debates.)  But the book does more.  It helps the reader understand Lincoln and the issues that lead to the Civil War.  The Cooper Union speech was lengthy, scholarly, and factual and endeavored to show that a majority of the founders -- those that signed the Constitution -- believed that Congress had the right to regulate and prevent the spread of slavery into the territories.  This issue was central to the dispute between North and South and to Lincoln's debates with his great opponent, Senator Douglas. Holzer's book begins with a discussion of how Lincoln, the self-educated backwoods lawyer and stump speaker carefully researched this issue in an attempt to present a dispassionate yet morally committed approach to the issue of slavery.  The book includes excellent accounts of the difficult and tiring nature of train travel during Lincoln's time, especially for an aspiring presidential candidate travelling to make a major address.  It includes fascinating discussions of the New York City of 1860 --Walt Whitman's New York -- and its docks, piers, hotels, and Broadway.  There is a wonderful account of Lincoln's visit while in the City to Five Points -- a notorious slum -- and a letter he subsequently received in the presidency from young men in a charitable school that he visited at the time.  While in New York, Lincoln had a famous photograph taken by Matthew Brady. Brady's artistry made Lincoln look distinguished and presidential rather than like a tall, gangling shabbily dressed backwoodsman.  The Brady photo together with the speech helped bring Lincoln to public attention.  In the heart of the book, Holzer offers a detailed analysis of the Cooper Union speech (the text is given in an appendix) and of Lincoln's delivery that fateful evening.  Although his audience was initially taken aback by the rough-hewn Lincoln, the substance of the speech and Lincoln's style of his delivery captivated the audience and made an astonishing impression.  Lincoln helped shepherd his text into print, and made  a hectic speaking tour of New England while visiting his son Robert at Exeter, thus furthering his position as a statesman of vision, integrity, and prudence.  An interesting feature of the book is how Holzer reminds the reader of the fragile nature of historical accounts, including alleged eye-witness accounts.  Many times, Holzer points out a received account of the Cooper Union speech and shows in detail how the account is questionably supported or is inconsistent with other sources. (For example, there is a story that Erastus Corning, Director of the New York Central Railroad offered Lincoln the position as corporate counsel following the speech for the large salary of $10,000.  Holzer shows that this account lacks foundation.)  The book shows how historical sources need to be approached, used, and interpreted with caution.  This book is an outstanding account of Lincoln in his complexity as a pragmatic, opportunistic and yet highly principled leader.  It gives a vivid picture of our country and its political life in 1860.  It considers issues about the nature of the Union and of human freedom that Lincoln addressed eloquently. These issues remain with us today.  Robin Friedma 
 This crime drama/mystery is set in a post-riot Detroit, and touches on many issues that Motown has yet to resolve.  First we have an elegant, well scripted political fundraiser for the potential first black governor of Michigan. This event is held at the still open Book-Caddilac Hotel, and you will see a number of Detroit landmarks in this film that were still in use at this time (1973), and today they are either gone (Union Depot, JL Hudson), or remaining as a ruin (Caddilac Hotel). The event is robbed and the first charge made is that if this was a "white" event there would have been a better police pressance to protect it.  That about sets the tone for this movie.............  A veteran white detective, gets paired with a younger, black rising star to solve the crime.  In the interim we are shown the world of lingering racism, black on black exploitation, and the ever corupt world of politcs no matter what race the politicians are, and the politics of religon (no that is far from a new concept).  This movie is VERY graphic in the chase scene (most of it filmed on the approach trackage to the then already closed Union Depot), and the business side sex is featured as well.  A very well done film (rescued by Quentin Taratino) that is far above the "Blacksploitation" film genre of the 1970's. A strong soundtrack adds the perfect background for many of the scenes, and the group of singers at the hotel, after the bobbery add a touch of the macrabe to the aftermath.    .and Detroit continues to grapple with these issues today. on Fort Street).    
 it is a very good book. nacy keeps you in such suspense. you keep on reading and reading.i finish it in i day 
 I am the worlds biggest procrastinator when it comes to putting together furniture!  I bought this piece, along with the desk, in January and here it is April, and I am just now getting the job done.  The table part of this product was fairly easy to put together and at this point my spirits were high.  The file drawer on the other hand is a different story.  None of the pieces are labeled, getting the two sides and the front to align long enough to put the screws was almost impossible and I did need to use a hammer to fishish off the screws.  I liked to never figure out why my drawer was not sitting right, when I finally figured it out that I had it in on the wrong side.  Overall, putting it together could have been made easier with written directions instead of just pictures, screws that actually screwed all the way in and pieces that are labled.  The file cart is a little wobbly but seems to be sturdy enough to hold my printer...for the time being 
 One of a handful of books that made me cry. And not just get teary eyed, but actually cry.  This one is the first book in Brockmann's Navy SEAL Team 16 series. I got this one to read after randomly reading the 6th book in the series.  Anyway, good book. It's about team commander Tom Paoletti who is on medical leave after sustaining a head injury in a helicopter explosion. He has residual dizziness, and possibly paranoia as side effects. So he goes back to his hometown where he was once a total bad boy. At the same time he's there, the girl he was in love with as a 19 year old (she was 15...they only ever kissed) has returned home to take care of her dying father (she's a doc.). At the airport, Tom thinks he sees a man who is a terrorist known as The Merchant. The only problem is the Merchant is thought dead. Tom doesn't know whether he really saw him or his head injury made him think he did. The book, then, is about his romance with Kelly, and the terrorist.  Brockmann's style in these books is a little difficult to get used to. The book isn't just about the male/female pairing and the suspense plot. She actively uses supporting characters as more than just people to move the story along. They have full-fledged roles and romances...not as focused on as the main two, but still fairly major roles. Sometimes they are other members of Team 16, sometimes they are relatives of the other characters. Also in the 2 books I've read, she has sections that look back on some point in the past. With this book, it was scenes involving Kelly's father and Tom's great-uncle and their time as spies in WW2 France.  At first, it's a little difficult to keep your head in the book because the scenes are going back and forth between all the characters involved and the history scenes. But then once you get into all the stories being told, you don't really mind. There was a really great romance between Tom's niece, and this geek named David. The history scenes were interesting, maybe longer than they needed to be, but they were a pretty big part of the story as they explained why Kelly's father and Joe's uncle acted the way they did, which in turn played a role in how the book ended. So everything tied together.  The end made me cry. It was so sad/tragic/poignant. And absolutely fitting. I think I liked it better than the other one I read, #6, but I'm not sure. The books are in a way very connected. The characters don't just pop up in their individual book, they have roles in the other books. The male/female lead from #6 are first introduced in #1, and the male/female lead from #1 are major players in #6. It adds a completely new aspect to the 6th book (which is why they should be read in order). So I kinda see some of the things from #6 in a different light now that I've read #1.  Rating: 4 /  
 We Southerners have a saying, "Someone from the North will speak ill about you to your face. Someone from the South will smile and speak sweetly to your face, but cut you to the quick as soon as your back is turned." Hellman demonstrates that readily in her engaging script.  The Little Foxes has Bette Davis at the zenith of her "bitchiness" in this film. With Lillian Hellman's spot-on script, there is no more unfeeling witch than that which Davis portrays...and yet, she does so believably and with charm and elegance. Herbert Marshall, as Davis' sickly husband, is great (though because of his performance in this film, I'll forever think of him as sickly and weak). Theresa Wright as Davis' thoughtful and caring daughter brings a balance to the sinister behavior of Davis' Regina and her brothers (Charles Dingle and Carl Benton Reid).  Regina Giddens married Horace for position and money. She has ruled the roost during their marriage and installed her corrupt brothers and nephew as managers of the bank Horace owns. Their position allows them to bilk the townspeople and embezzle money. However, when they need a large sum of money to buy a cotton gin, even the crooked family members cannot proceed without funds that even they cannot acquire through graft. Regina must call Horace back from the santiarium where he is recovering from a heart ailment. Horace must agree to partner with the brothers and Regina and open the gin - or else.  Davis' performance is as tightly wound as the bun in which she keeps her hair. The characters are so fully developed that you'll find yourself actually getting involved with the story.  There aren't too many films out there that are as good as this one. Top notch entertainment 
 I BOUGHT THIS BIKE FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVES IT!  NO PROBLEMS WITH IT SO FAR, IT IS BUILT WELL AND THE PRICE WAS AWESOME. 
 Writing a PhD prospectus can be pretty intimidating.  Where do you start? What do you include?  What do you not include? This little book has the answers, and it has been an enormous help to me as I write my own proposal.   Friedland and Folt's book is very clear and well-written, and full of  practical information on how to write a clear, concise, and exciting  proposal. Exercises along the way help to guide you step-by-step through  the whole thought process. With this book in hand, writing a prospectus  almost seems easy!  This book should be sent to all first-year students,  along with their registration materials 
 This book is a study more than a story. Yes there is a story in the study, but the study of a family that has an autistic child and a non autistic child. Autism is incredibly difficult on a family that wants to have a normal social life but perhaps even more difficult on the "normal" child who must spend many devoted hours a day babysitting the sibling that never grows up, but lives by rules. Without "rules" in the autistic child would    have so much more difficulty living in the world of "normal people."    The real value I see in this book is the study of what the family must go through to raise the autistic child. Through this study we learn to appreciate that family's capacity love - outside of what is normal. The book even goes so far as to ask the reader, what normal is.   If you or someone in your family has to deal with children with autism, either in or outside your home, then this is an important book to read. If you feel the need to know more about how a family struggles to stay together and the burden that an autistic child places on the family unit, or if you want to read about the extraordinary tolerance, the frustration and the sometime uncanny wit that might occur because of the autistic child -- than this book is for you.     I am giving this book 4 stars because it makes us aware of the sensitivity of the subject matter.       
 This is a great book. It is clear and concise. The style is not at all dry. I found it provided the information I wanted as well. Probably my only criticism is the JBOSS workbook which comprises the second half of the book. There's nothing wrong with it per se. It just seems like it should be a different book. An EJB reference (Such as the JavaScript reference in the O'Reilly JavaScript: The Definitive Guide) would have been more helpful.  Otherwise, I highly recommend it 
 If you love Jefferson, biography, American history, good writing in fat  books and if you have world enough and time, this monumental six volume  biography is calling you. Jefferson has taken his knocks recently and  deservedly so, but while this is stronly sympathetic to the sage, it is not  uncritical nor a whitewash. While Jefferson has earned his detractors, he  deserves his admirers too, and in Malone he has found a worthy and eloquent  celebrant of his genius. John Adams was right: Jefferson still lives and  nowhere as happily as in this biography 
 Maybe you need to see it in the context of the show. I loved the show and the cast recording. To each his own 
 I've never found a very resourceful personal financial planner like Suze. Her advice is very simple, easy to understand and valuable. Reading her book is definitely worth investment in time and money 
 This is a very well written book that covers comprehensively and in depth all the important features of Windows 2000 Professsional and is ideally suited for technical professionals who use the OS. I am a developer of business applications on Windows 2000 platform, so it is essential for me to have an intimate knowledge of the OS. I studied this book cover to cover and I heartily and unhesitatingly recommend this book. This book can be used both as a study guide as well as a reference 
 AS a professional of 10 years now(currently working with Wolfgang Puck), this book should be a must read before you commit to being a chef.  It gives a realistic look into what working in the high end kitchens in the World is REALLY like.(The long hours, heat, working sick, tempers,low pay, etc.) What you see on cooking shows is staged and is not a indication of the day to day grind that a kitchen hits you with. Most people have NO IDEA what they are getting themselves into!  I suggest to anyone who is considering taking on the challenge of earning the title "Professional Chef"-REad this book, get a job in kitchen before you spend money on cooking school to see if you like it, and ask yourself-do you love food, or do you just think it would be a glory filled way to fame?  
 Three weeks ago, I was traveling with my brother to a Purdue football game. On this particular journey, my brother brought the New Testament in its original Greek as his "light" reading material. I forgot to bring "Crossing Califonia", which I was reading at the time, so I stopped by the airport book store to find something that might rival my brother's manuscript in intensity and intelligence. Of course, equaling scripture is quite difficult, but I looked for a smart book nonetheless. I choose "State of Fear" for the shear number of references. While flipping through the book, I noticed a bibliography. A quick count yielded over 150 references, which stunned me. This is more references than you will find in many Doctoral theses......for a book of fiction! Many of these references are from peer reviewed journals, textbooks and government reports, so you are not just getting fluff from your local newspaper.   The main premise of the book is to examine global warming from a new perspective. As such, some doubt about carbon emissions as the main cause of the warming is presented. However, make no mistake, the book does not take an anti-environmental stance, and in fact expresses the idea that global warming does seem to be occurring. The book simply points to other possibilities for the warming and divergent data points to show that the warming may not be occurring as fast as the media would like us to believe. For example, land use warming caused by the growth of cities seems to be a very plausible argument and Crichton backs it up with massive amounts of data. He also shows how faulty temperature readings and historic records can lead to a false "crisis", and how the media and traditional environmental groups thrive on fear inducing environmental disasters (its all about the money....of course).  Crichton's brilliantly developed dialogue between movie-star "ideologues" / limousine liberals and an FBI agent, (who also just happens to be an encyclopedia of environmental information) is priceless. Every point about the pending environmental disaster due to the greenhouse effect is raised and elegantly disputed with well researched data and scientific evidence. After these discussions had transformed one particular "star" into a whimpering fool, I must admit watching his rather graphic demise was quite the guilty pleasure.  The heroes of the book are likable enough and the plot moves quickly, although many may find it unrealistic. For example, what FBI agent would take Evans, the wimpy lawyer, and Sarah, the beautiful blond secretary (well maybe he would take this one) on a "trip" to fight eco-terrorists, and how many wealthy, old, white guys do you know who could live on an island with cannibals alone for nine days? Most probably couldn't make it in their back yard for a night, but this guy was able to survive a cannibal infested island. None of this really mattered as it was an intelligent, entertaining, and fun read and the new ideas about global warming were fascinating.  I read this 600+ page book in just under three weeks. I have never before, nor will I ever again read such a large book in such a short time. I could not put the book down. It was that good 
 The good news is that all of the Mitchell virtues displayed in "Up In the Old Hotel" are emphatically present in this welcome collection of his earlier work for divers New York newspapers of the Depression era. Whether interviewing boxing promoters, or anyone in else George Bernard Shaw or the purveyors of Harlem "voodoo" products, Mitchell never lost his sense of courtly curiousity or his unerring ability to choose just the right word to express the outre character and often heartbreaking earnestness of his human subjects. Here's a worthy companion to sit on the shelf between A. J. Liebling's "Back Where I Come From" and "Up In The Old Hotel."  It it also, by the way, a far better buy than the newly-republished "McSorley's Wonderful Saloon," the lion's share of which was reprinted in "Up In The Old Hotel. 
 After the heinous trash that was No Prayer For The Dying, Iron Maiden managed to put out a decent album before saying a fond farewell to frontman Bruce Dickinson.  With such cool songs as Afraid To Shoot Strangers, Fear Of The Dark & Be Quick Or Be Dead, Maiden was showing some signs of resurgence.  There is the usual amount of filler that has become the staple of Maiden albums for the past decade but it's reasonable instead of mildly retarded.  Here To Eternity is okay.  Weekend Warrior, Fear Is The Key & Judas Be My Guide are auto-pilot Iron Maiden.  This is truly the end of an era.  Dickinson will eventually return, but the year 2000 will have come and gone.    Dig it! 
 Very good book.  We get to see the other point of view.  The historical aspect is very interesting.  
 I thought these "Dummies" books really were for dummies, so being a seasoned professional in the web design business, I poo pooed this book.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book has taken my business, AUDIN Web Design, to new levels of Search Engine Optimization nirvana.  I've been able to get two keyword phrases for my clients like "dining greenwich" or "la guardia limo".  Please note, I don't recommend that any bozo to do their own search engine optimization (leave that to the highly trained and skilled professionals).  SEO is a highly complex task, but this book will certainly give you the information you need to interrogate any SEO professional that promises you the world 
 Seierstad writes a compelling book about cultural and personal differences.   I actually can read between the lines the efforts of a man who is trying to find his own voice in a system that does not work as we think.  With Seierstad's candid observations, one might feel compelled to shout and scream... but yet any body who does not have the opportunity to stand out and taste criticism will shield from taking actions.   I loved the way the author was able to clearly state facts and jumped into her emotions (and I can only imagine the shock). Most people will fail to recognize the main character's effor to provide for an honorable way of living, help his younger wife to read, and do his best.   When we read the book without judgement, we are able to understand how we differ. I actually think I can understand why this or that happens.. Reconstruction after war is hard, anybody who has had to live and survive a very strict regime builds up character or shuts down. I usually found myslef thinking what would I do as any of the character's personalities emerged... it was fascinating.   I smiled at the young teenager boy... thinking of my brother, then my son..  of my feminist father and how he would try to emancipate his daughters and truly believe the guy is making a difference in HIS culture which might be less shocking than if we took someone from OUR culture to make drastic changes.  The insecurity portraid by the female characters also happens to so many people (mostly woman who chose to stay at home to care for kids for a while) who leave the competitive world to nurture others.   but most importantly, the book is a gift of courage on everyone.. to tell how they see it, and not pretending to live in a perfect world. I admire their courage, from the comfort of my house, with water and electricity, glass windows and no fear that I'll get bombed.   I couldn't put it down...   IF you want a TOTAL SHOCK, READ IT WITH 'EMERGENCY SEX'(and other desperate measures 
 Well is a nice compilation of the Costes collection but there's emphasis in the last three albums. About the mix, is good, but it could be better. Stphane Pompougnac, is a great Dj and mixer but in this compilation of compilations he had less inspiration than the other albums. So if you have not listened any of the previous 7th albums, this will be a good, but not great choice. So if you had the other seven albums, this one has a nice bonus track that was not released in the collection (That's why I rate the album with four stars) 
 Investor Robert P. Miles tells you everything you ever wanted to know about Warren Buffett's legendary Berkshire Hathaway. The company's plain-living, financial wizard of a chairman dominates this inventive and informative inside tour. The format - a listing of 101 reasons to own the stock - enables Miles to deliver a massive amount of information. Each entry is straightforward, packed with plenty of supportive data and a lively read. We from [...] recommend this book to investors and to anyone who'd like to know more about Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, the only stock that comes with an owner's manual 
  With more than 150 recipes, more than 1100 photographs, and about 250 different cooking techniques explained in detail, this book is the most impressive practical guide I have ever read.   Each technique is explained in detail, emphasizing on how it affects the flavor of the finished dish. knowing how to use a technique implies efficiency, but knowing why you have to choose one technique over another one to prepare a dish implies mastership.  The book has a practical approach, with cross-reference through the text to related topics and techniques. Here I found not only recipes and techniques, but also an extensive glossary of term that I have used many times.  This book will change the way you look at cooking forever. 
 I LOVE this book.  It is perfect for beginners and long-time Buddhists alike, presenting scenarios and solutions such as how to be mindful and compassionate during traffic jams, fights with one's spouse, dealing with jerky bosses, and more important things like dealing with depression, anxiety and your life's dreams.  Metcalf is spiritual without being sanctimonious, writes with a sense of humor, and even encourages us to say "F*** spirituality. Do better. Love more."  Thich Nhat Hanh and Alan Watts are wonderful, but often hard to read and comprehend.  "Just Add Buddha" is easy and fun to read, and I now find myself applying dharmic practice to everyday situations readily because of Metcalf's suggestions.  It is a small book, so I carry it in my purse and even use it to meditate when I get stressed.  I highly recommend this little book 
 The first thing that hit me was the quality of the vocals by Duda.  He reminds me of John Wetton and he isn't afraid to experiment with it as he does on the opening cut.  This isn't what I expected but that's a good thing.  The music here is dark and moody but very melodic and memorable.  The ethnic classical music influences are prevalent but help to create a very unique style of progressive rock.  The only real criticism I have is that the drums get buried in the mix from time to time and that really detracts from the dynamics of certain songs.  But these guys are young and future releases will hopefully correct that oversight.  For now they have provided us with an album that intrigues and entertains on many levels 
 The Spaghetti Incident? is a tight album. I love the megalomaniac GN'R numbers with huge sound on their other albums, but this one is great for it's back-to-roots punk numbers delivered in full force. The covers are better than the originals, which weren't bad themselves (I checked the originals out, like they suggest). If I have a bad day and put this album on the world's right with me again. The sheer energy and the FU attitude is pretty cleansing. The album is avoid of any "fat". It's a lean mean rock'n'roll machine 
 Michael SANG (not sing...SANG!) on 'Off The Wall' (1979), which released 4 number one singles!! The remastered edition includes better sound quality & a few bonus tracks. The Classic songs on 'Off The Wall' include 'Don't Stop Till You Get Enough', 'Rock With You', 'Working Day & Night', 'Off The Wall', 'She's Out Of My Life', and 'I Can't Help It' (Stevie Wonder hooked Michael up with this one!).   In addition to the magic pen of Rod Temperton, the rhythm sections from BOTH Rufus and The Brothers Johnson probably made it easier for Quincy Jones to produce this classic for Michael. 'Off The Wall' still sounds great TODAY, and it's foundations can be heard on 'Destiny'(1978) by The Jacksons, and 'You Can't Win' (fr.'The Wiz' SDTK 1978). 'Off The Wall' changed the way music was made (to an extent), and many fans still prefer it over 'Thriller'.   Following the massive success of 'Off The Wall', Michael sang on 'This Had To Be', which is from the 'Light Up The Night' CD (1980) by the Brother's Johnson, but after recording with his Brothers again (the hit album 'Triumph' 1980), nobody expected or knew that Jackson would eventually make history later in 1982. Also, isn't it amazing how the new remastered editions of 'Off The Wall' don't include the ORIGINAL cover art, which shows a 'pre surgical' Michael Jackson ?? Hmmmm.....At any rate, 'Off The Wall' is VERY ESSENTIAL & TIMELESS! Your music library is incomplete without this CD!  Peace, SD (of 'Chaka's World') 
 Somehow the sum of the story, descriptions of tools and techniques, and simple drawings adds up to one of the most compelling, accessible, and effective depictions of life in 19th century America I've every read.  I came across this wonderful book while doing research for my undergraduate thesis over thirty years ago, I used it very effectively to teach high school history, and just last year I had a great time reading it with my 11 year old son.  In all those years I have never seen it fail to engage and energize the reader, often compelling them out of their seats to try one the contraptions for themselves (the ink recipe works well).  How cool is that! 
 I loved this book and this series, I couldn't put this book dow 
 UK (1978.) UK's first album.  INTRODUCTION: It was in the year 1978 that the short-lived progressive rock supergroup UK released its first album. Like most supergroups, UK was a short-lived one, creating very few releases in their short musical career. The group consisted of former King Crimson bassist/vocalist John Wetton, former Yes drummer Bill Bruford, former Roxy Music keyboard/synthesizer player Eddie Jobson, and Allan Holdsworth. With these giants of progressive rock together in one place, the results looked promising. But as any fan of these musicians knows, UK was a short-lived band. How does the 1978 self-titled debut from the foursome fare? Keep reading to find out!  OVERVIEW: UK released their self-titled debut album on EG Records in 1978. The band produced the album, For the debut, the band consisted of bassist/vocalist John Wetton, drummer Bill Bruford, keyboard/synthesizer player Eddie Jobson, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth. This was the only album to feature Bruford and Holdsworth; they left after this album and became a three-piece group with former Frank Zappa drummer Terry Bozzio. The group's self-titled 1978 debut album's tracklist consists of In The Dead Of Night, By The Light Of Day, Presto Vivace And Reprise, Thirty Years, Alaska, Time To Kill, Nevermore, and Mental Medication.   REVIEW: I wasn't too sure what to think of this album at first. I mostly just bought it because I was curious about John Wetton's days between King Crimson and Asia, and because I was a Yes fan and the group featured Bill Bruford. When I listened to the album I was blown away. The album had a sound all its own - and in a good way, too. The sound is like a cross between Wetton's King Crimson and Wetton's Asia, with progressive techno-jazz elements thrown into the mix. And the sound works excellently. There are very few albums like this one out there. Now, let's take a look at the tracklist, and see how each song fares!  -SIDE A-  -In The Dead Of Night: The album begins with a piece that actually consists of the first three album tracks. And it is the first album track that begins this medley. Jobson is the star of the show on this track, serving up some awesome keyboards that are going to grab your attention and keep a tight hold of it all the way through. Bruford, Holdsworth, and Wetton are no slouches, though. All in all, this is a damn good starter track.  -By The Light Of Day: For the second part of the medley, the band slows things way down. Jobson throws lots of synthesizers into the mix, making for a slow and melodic sound that is nothing short of excellent. The rest of the band also fares well once again, making for some more entertaining listening. All the way through, this is melodic and progressive rock at its finest.  -Presto Vivace And Reprise: Essentially, this track starts where the last once left off. We then get a solo of very electronic-sounding keyboards, as well as synthesizers courtesy of Jobson - who does a damn good job of it. The remainder of the song, as the former part of the title likely implied, is a reprise of the beginning of the medley. A nice way to finish off the medley.  -Thirty Years: Following the medley, we get a lengthy musical sequence, in which all four members of the band are given the golden opportunity to shine on their respective instruments. Each member of the group is given equal emphasis here, and as such, this is one of the strongest tracks that the album has to offer. While the song is mostly instrumental in its execution, it does feature some vocals. THIS is the way progressive rock is supposed to sound!  -SIDE B-  -Alaska: Instrumental, and a damn good one too. While it starts off rather predictably and mostly quiet, it quickly evolves in the second half into an electronic sound-heavy instrumental sequence. The band joins forces to create a wildly-memorable sequence here. Good stuff - need I say more.   -Time To Kill: The perfect cross between techno-jazz and progressive rock. If you've listened to the Ian Gillan Band's Clear Air Turbulence album (a damn fine techno-jazz album in its own right), you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this song. Definitely one of my favorite pieces here.  -Nevermore: Here the band serves up another one of there lengthy and incredible prog rock jam sessions. All the while, the band's stylings change dramatically, making this some of the band's most interesting and most diverse work of all. This one is definitely a worthwhile listen.  -Mental Medication: The band closes out the album in style. Here we get more of that techno-jazz/progressive rock goodness that only UK could possibly serve up. Jobson plays keyboards and synthesizers along with traditional-sounding piano in this track, which only adds to the musical diversity. All in all, an awesome album closer.  OVERALL: Overall, the debut album from UK is a fantastic progressive rock album - truly one of a kind. The members of this band had all played in excellent bands before and would continue to play in excellent bands, but they would never sound like this again. The UK era was truly unique. This is progressive rock at its very best. If you're a fan of this kind of music, or maybe you just want to see what these musicians sounded like apart from the bands they were best known for being in, give this album a listen. You'll be glad you did! Highly recommended to all classic prog rock fans!  EDITION NOTES: As good a band as UK was, they were a short-lived one, and they never gained great fame. As such, they tend to be overlooked by music fans. Because of this, their music is extremely difficult to find on CD. It's quite likely you're going to have to end up ordering their albums online, because they are tough to come by in stores. Hopefully the band's catalogue will be reissued and remastered one day, but that seems unlikely anytime soon.  
 For me, this was one of starters of Dean Koontz's books. I really liked the book. Dean Koontz is my favorite writers, cause of him I am doing my own book. Pick this one up, really good characters, main character, really good story, and plot 
 The pre-existential scalular network of streets--an interconnected web of  pointlessness and meta-consciousness--serves as the background to this  genre-hybridizing book by Jean Rhys.  One of several of her books focusing  on the feminine psyche as it trys to navigate the complicated socioeconomic  hierarchical male-dominated society of pre-postmodern Paris.  Rhys' main  character alternately smiles and crys reflecting the pressures of  pre-millenial Parisian society which judges her solely from the view of  their ocular organs--a tragedy that continues on into our own post-post-war  self-constructed society.  Nihilistic twists combined with masterly  commentary on the futilism of being  erupt into a majestic spewing of anger  and pre-post Derridadian philsophy .  Unfortunately Rhys is unable to  escape the male imposed strictures of the English language resulting in a  book which is inherently contradictory--as most, inevitably, are 
 This book will touch your spirit as well as provide information on how we can responsibly help others while helping ourselves.  Finished it in 2 sessions.  Highly recommend for those who utilize 'giving' as part of their personal spirituality.  Give it as a gift and share it's transformative powers 
 Excellent recipes with a real gourmet flare.  Lots of variety and flavors.  I especially like the menus listed in the front - you could easily pull together a wonderful gourmet vegan dinner party but other menu ideas show lunch options, simple soup meals, etc.  There's some of everything in here.  Roasted Sweet Potato and Corn Chowder was a recent hit with my husband.  Some recipes are easier than others - some are definitely more of an activity 
 I found the Jasmine recording good. Not excellent but it could be due to  less than high fidelity in the original soundtrack. It should have included  the Brindisi of Verdi's Traviata, it is one of Deanna's best performance:  lively, brilliant and merry 
 This is an excellent book and different method of sharing counting with students.  Great for teachers for preparation of academic testing 
   The Woodlanders is the eleventh novel by Thomas Hardy. Hardy takes us to an obscure village in his mythical Wessex. The novel portrays the beautiful Grace Melbury a nubile young miss coddled by her parents; eager for glamour and disdainful of bucolic boredom. Grace is courted by Giles Winterbourne a local rustic but cast him off to wed Dr. Edred Fitzpiers the local doctor. The marriage is a disaster for Fitzper lusts for Madame Charmond. He also has a fling with Suke a local girl. Fitzpiers flees to the Continent while Grace seeks reconciliation with  Winterborne. The couple hope to wed under a newly passed Parliamentary  law dealing with the right of women to obtain a divorce.   All goes wrong. Accidents occur as chance and fortune always play a part in the Hardy world. The novel does end happily which is rare for Hardy.   Hardy knew the English countryside as it moved from spring to winter. His description of nature is beautifully written. Hardy also knew the south of England as it was moving from the rural nineteenth century to the modern world of the coming twentieth century.   The Woodlanders is one of the lesser known Hardy novels that is well worth your attention. The story is well told with many interesting and exciting plot developments which will hold the attention. Well recommended. 
 Best Damn Earl Grey on the market. The Bergamot is well balanced with the black tea flavor. Still good even if the bag is left in for 'too' long. BUY THIS TEA 
 When this book was published for the first time over twenty years ago, it changed the way that people thought about strategy in business, and it gave us what has become a common language for discussing strategic situations.  That's why you should consider buying the book.  Without an understanding of the terminology that Michael Porter developed originally in Competitive Strategy, you won't be able to follow many of the arguments that other people use when they're talking about the subject.  When you get past that, you need to ask yourself your primary reason for reading any book on strategy.  If you're looking for a "how-to" book, one with ideas that you can implement reasonably quickly, this is not the book for you.  This is written by a professor and the presentation is academic.  That doesn't make the insights any less valuable, but often it makes them harder to unearth.    Here's my recommendation.   You should be familiar enough with Porter's basic methods and terminology to recognize and understand them in other books, articles, and discussions.  If you don't have that knowledge now, buy this book and develop that understanding.   If you already have a basic knowledge of some of Porter's terminology and concepts, then this book will give you an excellent structural underpinning to take to the other books about strategy.  But, if you're looking for something that you can dip into quickly to work on your company's strategic plan, find something a little less dense and academic 
 I must admit I bought this movie because i wanted to see Anne Hathaway nude but as I watched it I realized that it really was a good movie 
 I loved my Diaper Genie. I used it for 2 years without a problem. My teenage daughter even figured it out. It kept the smell contained pretty well. We would empty it about every 5 days and never had a problem. Well worth the investment 
 I don't know how familiar I can say I am with Krzystof Kieslowski. I've seen 2/3 of "The Decalogue" his ten-hour masterpiece and now I've seen the first film in his three colors trilogy "Blue." I think anyone who sees a film by Kieslowski will have a hard time disputing that he was one of the great directors. He's not credited as being one of the great directors, but he is credited as being a great director. Hopefully, in the years to come, his brilliance will become acknowledged. "Blue" is a strange film...It doesn't follow the typical rules of storytelling. It has a plot, but the images it uses play as big a part in telling the story as the plot does. Then there's the music. Rarely has the music been as important to a film as it is to "Blue." Juliette Binoche (who won a French Oscar for Best Actress for this role) plays Julie, a young woman whose husband and young daughter are killed in a car accident. Julie was in the car, but made it out alive. Once she heals up, she finds herself being badgered by friends and composers for her husband's last composition (her husband was a famous composer). The movie's turning point comes when Julie calls an old friend that she knows is in love with her. After they do their thing, she moves into an anonymous little apartment building in the hopes of escaping everyone she knows. She fears being hurt again and decides to have no friends, no acquaintances, and no family. Then, in a Kieslowski-like turn of events, she meets her husband's pregnant mistress. There are a lot of movies about people losing loved ones and trying to deal with it. In Kieslowski's hands, however, this formula seems fresh and new. There's no denying that Kieslowski and his co-writer Krzystof Piesiewicz understood the human condition and humans in general. None of the scenes in the film feel artificial or unneeded. Kieslowski doesn't waste time filling the screen with pointless scenes, but has it shaved down to the essentials. As I said, this film is very different. Unique would sum it up quite good. While I'd be lying if I said I understood the significance of this, there is something he does in the movie that I was quite fond of. In certain scenes, while Julie is talking usually, loud music will begin playing and the screen will fade to black. After a few moments, we fade back into exactly where we were. While I haven't seen the other films in the trilogy quite yet, I'm looking forward to them. Any fan of foreign cinema should see this film...If you haven't yet discovered Kieslowski, you need to.  GRADE: A 
 Brands does a wonderful job of research of one of the countries more popular Presidents.  I often wonder if I will be on Earth long enough to get to all the Biographies of the presidents, so I am so glad that I read this one.  Jackson not only is involved with the Revolutionary War, but made it through some of the more noted wars like the War of 1812, Battle of New orleans , Indian Wars....  wonderful time period for US Historians. Jackson had a front row seat...  this book will appeal mostly to hard core history readers and might take undaunted courage for those less apt towards such material. Brands gets compared with David McCullough and with good reason, they both have wonderful literary styles.  Brands does get into the area of too much detail or too much information, but still a very scholarly work, Bringing Jackson back to us for those of us who didnt have the pleasure to know him personally.  Funny how Jackson was around 50 years after the Declaration Of Independence to know that both Jefferson and Adams would die within hours of each other on July 4, 1826.  This book would also appeal to those who are interested in the early years of our country.  gotta love it 
 This book is beautiful and offers some inspiring embellishments for handbags.  While  the bags are relatively simple, the decorations are gorgeous!  This book has great ideas and I know I will make a few of them.  I would have liked some more unusual shapes and examples 
 I already own AIA's Architectural Graphics Standards for Residential Construction, which is an excellent reference book for use in designing, planning, and building a new house or remodeling an existing one. Wanting more information for interior design of a house, I reviewed a copy of this book at the library. The book is primarily targeted to those persons doing interior design work on commercial projects. If you're looking for interior design help for a house, I would recommend buying AIA's Architectural Graphics Standards for Residential Construction to use as a reference and look for other books targeted specifically at residential interior design 
 We just returned from a week in Cambodia.  It was a fantastic experience made that much easier because we brought the Lonely Planet guide with us.  It's lightweight and small.  The book pointed out some cool places that not even our guide told us about - bar street!  I've used these books all over Asia.  Highly recommended.  
 Cornwell takes Uhtred north in volume 3 of the Saxon Tales. Initially, he's looking to get away from King Alfred but plenty of adventure soon follows.   Not wanting to spoil the fun for other readers, I will refrain from going into plot details. Suffice to say, there's plenty of action but it fails to live up to the drama of being with King Alfred in Volume 2. The battle scenes are solid but do not live up to the epic struggle of the Battle of Ethandun described in "The Pale Horseman." That's no knock, however, since I cannot imagine you could produce that in every book.  What this series really needs is a good map. The maps in this series are just about worthless. Many of the places they travel to are not even on the map! What's the point of including it, then?  I give this one a grade of B+ 
 This is a the first book that gives a perspective of Hip-Hop from the perspective of its founders. It features interviews with Kool DJ Herc, Africa Bambataa, Grandmaster Caz, Sha Rock, Russell Simmons and more. If you want to know how Hip-Hop grew from a 1970's South Bronx Underground Culture to a Billion Dollar Industry this is the book you need to read.  You will learn how DJing and Mcing developed, The beginnings of Break Dancing and grafitti, and the origins of the Zulu Nation.It will bring back memories for all true school and old school hip-hop fans. In addition, it will give younger new school fans a history lesson they will not get in school 
 I read the Communication Systems Engineering book by Proakis and Salehi and comparing that with this book by Lathi, this book is a lot better. The concepts are explained much clearly and the book makes every attempt to relate the concepts with day to day life. Attention has been paid to detail so as not to confuse the student too much. Also the mathematics in this book is much more complete than the Proakis and Salehi book. I would recommend this book with 5 stars 
 Durkheim was not as scientific (or as sociological, or even as valid) as he might have been, but that matters little. He helped start the discipline, and the rest of us have had a century to make advances. This is where to see it just beginning to take form 
 As the son of a B-17 pilot, I have read several books on the subject.  This is a very good one (another is "Serenade to the Big Bird").  I learned more about the author's experiences during his non-flying time, how he felt sure early on that he'd never survive the war, how he grew confident in his flying skills, and married a young German girl after the war (they are still married! I wrote him a letter thanking him for writing the book and she called me to thank me.)    It would make a good movie.    
 Peppered with Buñuel's surrealistic touches, the film switches from reality to dream sequences so seamlessly that it's often difficult to tell which is which. Regardless, "Belle" addresses some of Buñuel's signature themes: the well-ordered, vacuous lives of the upper middle-class bourgeoisie, and the dark desires lurking beneath those placid facades. "Belle" is a multi-layered, mesmerizing work, and Deneuve, as always, is exquisite 
 This is the third book in the Mary Poppins series.  It's about all the adventures that the Banks children have with their nanny.  In one adventure they go to the park and see a lady selling peppermint stick horses.  They buy some and ride off into the sky!  You never know what type of adventure Mary Poppins has in store for the kids 
 A fascinating book!  Well-supported with evidence and inspoiring case examples, and a good read as well.  Quality bedtime or pleasure reading, whether you think you're a music lover or not.  Highly recommende 
 I thought the book was good, but i didn't like the ending. It just leaves you hanging. The rest of the book was exciting and adventureous. I hope there is a second book, because I want to read it. 
 The reviews I've read all follow a consistent theme - those familiar with the Aubrey/Maturin series are generally pleased with this outing, and those who made this their first adventure with Jack and Stephen in print disliked it.  Well, I can see why.    This is indeed one of the series' odder books, as it is a series of misadventures and personal setbacks for all concerned. Within this book, various crewmen onboard the HMS Surprise suffer lightning strikes, groundings, secret affairs, incredible seas south of Cape Horn, botched abortions, murders, mysterious hauntings, suicide, falling overboard, drifting in the ocean, near human sacrifice, head injury, coma, and being cast away on two separate desert isles.  All this, and the usual disappointment to the naturalists onboard as they sail past the Galapagos with "not a moment to lose".  If you know and love these characters, as any reader of Master and Commander and particularly Post Captain will do, then all of this is endurable and in fact, enlightening as it exposes us to a different view of these characters than is usual.    If you come upon them cold, then you get no glimpse of the very qualities that make one desire to sail with these men, and to read 20 separate volumes on their lives, loves and adventures.  Jack has little opportunity for combat or distinction.  Stephen has small chance to exercise his fiery intelligence and secret espionage skills. But if you know these men and their compatriots, then this outing is rewarding, and often amusing.  So, to sum it up, DON'T START WITH THIS BOOK. It would be like walking into "Gone with the Wind" 1/2 way through - interesting but confusing.  Start with Master and Commander or Post Captain, and you'll find yourself hooked, and then when you do read this book, you'll find it rewarding 
 Ray Lamontagne's new album contains more instrumentation than his first.  Although I wasn't sure at first whether I liked it as much as Trouble which I loved from the very first time I heard it, this one gets better the more you listen to it. Track 11 is one of his best ever and one of the nicest songs I've ever heard 
 I must admit, although this book is very desturbing and some of the characters rather creepy, I liked the plot. On a "ick" factor, I'd give it an 8 out of 10. But Hey, for a novel, that's a good thing in my book. At least the characters are believable, if not Icky. The series will get you hooked.

 Easy to understand and easy to build working wooden locks. I have the first book 'Working Wooden Locks" and have made all the locks in it. Sure would be nice if he would do another book with more/different locks. Be careful buying the second book. They are ONLY 2 Books.

 This book proved to be a great chronical of government and the ethics of it's representatives.

 In Sean Wilsey's later adolescence, as described in his best-selling memoir, Oh! The Glory of it All, he spent time at an alternative high school/college that he liked to Murakami's sanatorium in Norwegian Wood.  Having adored Wilsey's description of this alternative school, I picked up Murakami's novel to read about this place where both the doctors and patients help one another, where "we're all each others' mirrors, and the doctors are part of us.  They watch us from the sidelines and they slip in to help us if they see we need something, but sometime it happens that we help them."  Norwegian Wood is about much more than just this sanatorium, of course.  It's a love story at its core (which surprised hardcore Murakami fans, who were used to the darker, stranger topics of his first two novels).  We follow late 1960's college student Toru as he his torn between his mentally-ill pseudo-girlfriend and a spunky, unconventional, irreverent fellow classmate (who happens to have a boyfriend of her own).  Suicide is a repeated theme throughout the novel, along with love, lust, and what different people both give and expect from relationships.  The novel is filled with many unforgettable passages, but rather than recount them here, I encourage you to give this book a read.  I'm intrigued by this as Murakami's most "easily accessible" novel, so I'm looking forward to trying some of his more complex storylines, such as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.  
 I am usually quite skeptical of products like this, but after a long, long day - instead of flicking on the "tube" and further aggrevating myself with the nonsense on TV, I popped in Susies CD, and was pleasantly surprised. Within minutes I found myself relaxed and stress free. I went to bed that evening feeling like a new person. Thank You Susie Mantell 
 Finally, a sophisticated, imaginative and substantial collection of essays on the novel for a new generation of scholars, students, and people interested in literature.  Professor McKeon has done a terrific job of balancing classic founding essays, the latest contemporary thinking, and unique (even adventurous) perspectives on a genre for which he is an established expert.  McKeon's scholarly home is the 18th century, where he has been celebrated for his own contribution to the theory of the novel.  In this collection, he has deftly moved his choices between standards like Ian Watt, E.D. Hirsch, Joseph Frank, and Northrop Frye, modern critics like Georg Lukacs, Marthe Robert and Walter Benjamin, and contemporary theorists like Fredric Jameson, Linda Hutcheon, and Kwame Anthony Appiah.  What emerges is an often fascinating look at the varied ways the novel has been understood as both literary genre and cultural product throughout its history.  Not only will this be an instant hit for teachers of literature, for whom it will provide a flexible and inspiring framework, but for anyone who delights in ideas and the contemplation of culture--this will be their book to take to that desert island 
 'Essentials of English' is a great resource book to have on hand should you be uncertain if you are expressing yourself correctly in the written word. It is very concise, and while a bit 'dry', does not waste time in teaching you what you should know about the English language. But I am worried that I won't be able to remember what I am trying to remember from this book. I fear that no matter how hard I try, it is not sinking in and I just can't get it right. So while the book is excellent, I myslef am a failure on many counts 
 I'm very sorry that I didn't find this video a bit earlier in my child's speech development.  She's just over two, and just a little bit delayed, so this video wasn't much help for her.  It says it works for 3-30 months, but I think that it's aimed toward a level of development that my daughter is already past.  BUT, I will say that the techniques used are very good, and I plan to use it for my 4 mo daughter starting now.  These are the very same things I should have been doing to encourage my oldest's speech development, but I was too inexperienced a parent to do so.  Again, I would mostly advice this video for parents of younger children or older ones who are more significantly speech delayed.  Be warned, you don't just put this in the DVD player and forget about your child for a bit.  If you start using Baby Babble with your child, that means that you have to do some work, too.  Learn the signs, learn how to reinforce the lessons throughout your normal day.  This video is useless if you are not willing to focus on learning how to reinforce what is taught, too

 Hampton Sides has written a very readable classic.  Ghost Soldiers gives a blow by blow account of the rescue of the remaining Allied (mostly US) prisoners from the Japanese POW camp at Cabanatuan, Philippines.  The smallest details are noted, many of which are harrowing.  What the POWs went through during their three years of captivity after the fall of Bataan will shock you although readers who are familiar with WWII will know what I mean.  The highs and lows of man's character are laid out for all to see in this book and you can't help but be moved.  Following an "in your face" preface, the build up to the actual night of the raid, following the Rangers through the bush and profiling various individual POW's experiences, gets you to the edge of your seat as you wait for the first shot to be fired and the first prisoner to be rescued.  Hopefully we will never see the likes of WWII again but the people who were there deserve to be remembered and this book has to be one of the best records for that time 
 I was able to take my little one out in the running stroller at 7 weeks using the Snuzzler. I stuck to smooth bike paths until she was about 4 months, but her little head didn't budge when she was laying on this thing. In fact, I think she slept better in the running stroller w/ the Snuzzler than at home! The two sides are convenient b/c you can just flip it over depending on the kind of weather you're having: fleece side to keep her warm and the other to keep her cool when it's already warm out. By 4 months, she didn't need it in the car seat or swing anymore, but it still seems comfy for her in the running stroller even now at 5 months

 It was inevitable that mario kart would finally make its way onto the DS.  The question that was on everybody's mind was: is it going to be fun.  We can answer that question with an unequivocal "YES!  AND A BAG OF CHIPS!".  While it is not as pretty and intuitive as its big brother "Mario Kart: Double Dash" on the GC, it makes up for that tiny flaw with moxie and great design.  There are great new weapons at your disposal as well as more than a few familiar ones.  The single greatest weapon addition would have to be the ink bullet that temporarily blinds the driving screen forcing the gamer to navigate using the map on the upper screen.  And of course the new game brings in a new design feature that allows you to speed up if you tailgate your opponent for long enough, allowing you zip past the competition.    But the single greatest design aspect of Mario Kart DS that makes it a contender for greatest kart game ever is summarized by two simple words: Wireless Gameplay!  Now you can battle people as far as the other side of the world provided that you have useable WiFi in your area (and if you don't you can easily remedy this by buying the Nintendo Wireless dongle that attaches to your USB port on your PC for blissful online gameplay).  I have had my buttocks handed to me on numerous occasions by players from Japan, Mali and even in the good ole US of A as well as narrowly squeeking by with undeserved victories.  Player skills range from relatively new to god-like (mostly the japanese players), so you might want to brush up on your skills before entering the online arena, but rest assured that once you get into it you'll fall hard.    So, to summarize: Mario Kart DS good, so you should buy.  Seriously.  Click on the buy now button right now!  You won't regret it  
 A Journey to the Center of the Earth did not turn out to be quite what I was expecting; I can't say quite why, however, because I'm not entirely certain what those expectations were.  I hadn't read the novel previously, but I thought I knew what it was about.  As a result, I think I was expecting more drama than Verne delivers, or perhaps I simply wanted the book to be more than it is.  Most likely I was conflating Verne's novel with other texts: movie adaptations of the novel itself, for instance, in which considerably more in the way of actual antagonism--as opposed to the perils of nature itself--occurs; or hollow world stories, in which entire societies thrive on the inside of the earth's crust beneath the rays of a sun that lies at the planet's center.  A Journey to the Center of the Earth is neither of these things, of course, and if I underwent any disillusionment, it was purely of my own making.  Understood on its own terms, the novel is, at the very least, interesting, but, truthfully, not much happens.  The narrator's speculations (as well as his fevered dreams during times of travail) suggest a much wilder adventure than actually takes place.  Much of the action involves the trio of explorers stumbling around in caverns and tunnels, and much of the impediment takes the form of hunger, dehydration, or equipment loss.  In fact, as best I can judge, they really don't approach anywhere near the center of the earth, although they do travel quite a distance laterally before resurfacing.  The real joy is the interactions between the characters, primarily the trio of protagonists: the young narrator, his scientist uncle, and their silent, idiosyncratic guide.  The expedition leader is an archetypal nutty professor, whose words and actions seem nonsensical to those not privy to his thought processes; his nephew, the narrator, alternates between sheer wonder at his surroundings, and sheer terror at the likelihood of spending the rest of his short life surrounded by them; Hans, the guide, says almost nothing but performs his duties in an exemplary manner, and insists on being paid weekly rather than all at once, even while under the earth (a square deal, in his eyes).  Their interactions with each other, and with the variety of Icelandic folk they encounter on their way to the volcano which is their means of ingress, are wittily and cleverly depicted.  These character moments are the high point of the novel; one wonders how much of their clever interplay originates with Verne and how much is an invention of the translator (who, in this edition, remains sadly anonymous).  Whether the novel's tone in its English version is added or simply preserved in translation, full marks to whomever this perceptive soul is.  Though one reflexively considers Jules Verne a "science fiction" writer of a primitive sort, this is really more of an adventure tale and, taken as such, it is generally successful.  The adventurers don't explore a strange new world so much as become more intimately acquainted with the world they already know, but if the reader doesn't go in expecting flights of pure fancy, the novel is rather satisfying.  Postscript: I should point out that this review refers to the Signet Classic mass market paperback edition of the novel, which features an afterword by Michael Dirda.  Knowing Amazon, it's possible that this review will surface under several different versions, and without clarity, we have nothing. 
 i liked this book it was very deatailed and had alot of words in it. it was a long book.  ha dude i dont even know what the book is it is proble gay po ya i am a cyberbullie ooooo 
 I loved this book. I especially liked the chapters about Rufus and Hughie running away from school and Joey dancing the Sailor's Hornpipe. Chet was my favorite character in the book, and also his brother Hughie. If they were based on real people the author knew, I'd like to read about who they really were. I love the Pudges 
 This product definitely saves space but I've had a hard time cleaning the tray. Yes, it's dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that I end up hand-washing it. There are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that I'm always finding places that I misseed washing. Trust me, the baby will manage to get food there too!   This product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing (I've seen this on some highchair models). 
 Timely delivery.  The book was great.  My great grandson loved it

 I have always been interested in reading more about the Mitfords and, given that I am from the U.S. and far too young to remember any of the family's political antics, I am less concerned with whether a book is an apologia for one or another set of political beliefs than some other readers might be.  Given that the sisters took up extreme positions at opposing ends of the political spectrum (on the one hand, Diana, the wife of England's leading fascist and Unity, the "Hitler groupie"; on the other hand, Decca, the "parlor pink" who married, in turn, a Communist and a Jew), the author faces a difficult balancing act in trying to devote equal time and analysis to all.  As anyone who comes from a large family knows, siblings have a way of remembering the same incidents completely differently and this book suffers from a lot of conflicting viewpoints with, seemingly, no apparent way to get at the truth without alienating one or more of its subjects.  It appears that the author was very dependent on the cooperation of the surviving Mitfords to write this book as it does seem in places like the book is pandering to one sister or the other, particularly Diana who comes off as near-saintly despite her questionable personal life and political views.    I also wish that more space had been devoted to the life of Nancy, the author, and the Mitford son who died in military service and seems in hindsight to have been nearly forgotten by history.  As both passed away before the book was written, one might think that the author's focus would naturally be on the living family members, except that the author dwells at great length on the long-dead Unity's chummy relations with Hitler and the related fascist escapades of her sister Diana.  I think Nancy was a much more interesting person than Unity overall and was disappointed at the lack of details about Nancy's life aside from references to her unhappy marriage and her love affairs.  However, the book was still filled with interesting details and enjoyable to read, even if the focus was a bit uneven 
 In "Guide to Imagery Series" books I found the books on art  that give an exceptionally clear presentation of the subject. I bought 6 books from this series ("Gospel figures in art" among them) and I really found what I was searching for. You can study Old and New Testament as well as ancient mythology reading these books, understand the role of different details, symbols drawn on each picture. Inside each book there is a short description of the specific topic followed by  full-colour reproductions of the pictures on this topic from different museums all over the world with detailed explanations to each picture. It was amazing to find  and understand the meaning of different pictures I saw in art galleries in St.Petersburg, Berlin, Munich, Dresden, Venice, Naples and other places.  Really a great selection of art works is presented in each of these books. I strongly recommend all these books to everybody who wants  to understand the meaning of the pictures and get a nice art collection at home.

 Hollywood has often visited the story of the teacher who comes to make a difference. There have been some fine films born from that premise but Children of a Lesser God gets my vote as the really interesting one.  William Hurt's James is an offering that has a real feel to it. He has wandered through some of his earlier days, drifting and learning through a variety of different disciplines and jobs (as principal Bosco points out to him while he is interviewing Hurt). He is cocky, passionate and searching but there is also the hint of arrogance in his motivations. William Hurt has never been better and he delivers a subtle, intense and yet a kind performance.  Marlee Matlin's Sarah is equally as compelling and her portrayal- explosive and needing at every turn. No wonder she won the award for this work. She conveys the frustration this character feels with a precise on target delivery.  What makes this story interesting is that it is the story of a teacher who reaches into himself, reaches into a quiet that has robbed a group of students of their ability to actively participate, and reaches into the life of a young woman who has imprisoned herself in her own frustration and anger. All are changed by the results and in a very real, positive and life renewing way.  Randa Haines direction is restrained, inspired and poetic and the film plays like a glimpse into someone's life. It's a beautiful thing to watch and to learn something from. And while I've said it's a story of a teacher who has come to make a difference, it is also a very tender and moving story of love. Love between James and Sarah, between James and his students and between the small community that is depicted here.  Special mention to of Piper Laurie and Philip Bosco's work here as the mother and the principal. They are two extremely fine character actors whose work (as always) is nothing short of a joy to watch. They lend the more sage advice that rounds this story's points out to have some real weight.  If you're looking for a film that lends its love on several levels, this is the one for you.

 Although this book is strangely organized it is extremely fascinating.  It is a good introduction to the field but has a lot to offer the expert.  Keegan was a professor at Sandhurst.  The book is mostly about ancient history.  Worth a read 
 This is a fantastic book on coaching!  From the very first pages it is filled with insights and specific advice on things that are most important for coaching, behaviors, activities, things to strive for, things to avoid.  Highly recommended for those considering a career in coaching and may be even helpful for experienced professionals.  However, in my opinion, it is more of a book for a full-time coach rather than a manager or a team leader who want to build their coaching skills 
 Some books excite you; some bore you; some interest you.  This book embraces and engulfs you.  It is impossible to imagine anyone reading it without both raging and exhulting.  A wonderful, beautiful, searing book.  The first paragraph (which I read to my students as an example of 'The Event That Most Changed My Life') will suck you in so far you'll read it with fury, passion, and an intensity that makes both most autobiography seem limp and most writing seem pale.  Richard Rhodes is a fine writer, but this book is more than written.  It is bled

 I'm a big fan of Yancey's writing style and clarity, and I really enjoyed this work.  That said, if you're new to this author, I'd suggest starting with either The Jesus I Never Knew, or What's so Amazing about Grace (or perhaps one of his books that deal with the issues of pain).  If you're not new to Yancey, and are wondering what kind of book this is, here's my take:  It's not really a scholary look at the Old Testament, like who wrote what, when and why.  It's more of an over view of why the Old Testament is still important to us today, and how it relates directly to our Christianity.  Yancey tackles the questions of why life sometimes stinks and is seemingly unfair (an age old question asked in some of the oldest writings of men).  Yancey writes about how Jesus answers the nagging thoughts about whether or not an individual matters to God, questions that where asked over and over in the Old Testament, not only by individuals, but by the early Hebrews through the glory period of the Jewish nation on to the time of Christ when it seemed that Israel would be perhaps be destroyed forever as a nation.  If you are new to Christain books (or new to Christianity) I suggest reading the other Yancey books first, then if you feel, as I do, that he's a really wonderful writer, you'll naturally come back to this one.  I only gave this book less than five stars because I felt it was a bit too short, and just not quite as good as some of the others, not because I don't highly recommend it. 
 This book provides a one-stop history of socialist ideology from the French Revolution through the Blair government from the perspective of a self-described original red-diaper baby who has since rejected socialism.  Although it is probably impossible to get an objective discussion of the intellectual history of socialism, this probably comes as close as anyone could get.  If there were one flaw in the book, it would be the neglect of the Scandinavian experience with socialism, including its ultimate rejection by the voters in those countries (rejection?  Yes.  Ikea, Nokia, and Saab aren't state-owned, are they?)  I originally saw it in a bookstore and was especially surprised by the chapter on Mussolini.  Apparently, Benito grew up in a socialist household, rose through the ranks of the socialist party, and broke from them in the aftermath of WWI.  His father - a member of the International - named him after four different famous socialists, read Marxist texts at the dinner table every night.  Young Benito was a rising star in the Italian Socialist party, edited their magazine, and eventually became a party leader.  On the outbreak of WWI, Benito had the same reaction as his hero, Lenin: they both saw that the workers in various countries rejected Marx's internationalist philosophy and rushed to arms and exclaimed, "the international is dead".  Benito, however, began to develop a new variation on Marxism: he believed that stronger countries oppressed weaker countries like Italy in the same way they believe that capitalists oppress workers.  He believed that the entire country must rise up against the stronger nations in order to allow the workers to rise up as predicted by Marxist dogma.  He also saw how camaraderie in the army was the epitome of the class solidarity they sought, and decided to pursue a strong state based on a strong, army-like command structure.  You know: Fascism.  Throughout his life, he continued to admire the work of Lenin and Stalin, and the feeling appears to have been mutual until he tossed in with Hitler.  The other chapters were also enlightening, but not as surprising.  The failure of Owen utopianism is traced directly to Engels' appearance in his Church of Science.  Engels and Marx are traced to their selected successor, Bernstein, and his observation that the Fabians' approach of reform was having the results that Marx claimed could only come about through revolution.  This in turn led to a response by a young Russian named V.I. Lenin, bringing forth the theory of perpetual revolution, in which reform would be rejected and workers would be kept in a constant state of agitation.  To see the outcome of that line of thought, I'd recommend the Black Book of Communism.  There are also several chapters on the policies of Clements and the failure of the Socialist experiment in England, the experience of Socialism in Africa, and the fall of communism featuring Deng Xiaoping and Mikhail Gorbachev.  However, I found the chapters on the anti-socialist and anti-communist philosophies of Samuel Gompers and George Meany, and the epilogue describing the history of the kibbutzim in Israel to be the most fascinating.  Despite leading the labor movement, Gompers and Meany were both strongly anti-communist and insisted that the goal of the labor movement was to negotiate for workers so that they could earn their way into the middle class.  That stands in stark contrast to the union movement today, in which they are hardly distinguishable from the socialist parties.  The kibbutz experience was similarly fascinating: it seems to have been successful so long as the survival of Israel hung in the balance, but has since fallen apart as younger people felt the desire for something more than working their lives away at subsistence level while giving away all privacy.  They discovered that capitalism yields both individual economic results as well as moral bonuses like individual rights and privacy 
 First I must say that I had seen this book and even picked it up several times in the store, only to put it back down. I don't know, I think it was the cover that made me question it's appeal. However, I finally said, what the heck...I have nothing to loose, I can always put it down. Well, you can imagine my surprise when I found myself flipping page after page, and transporting myself to a small part of the world, Natchez MS. I had never heard of the author Greg Iles and this was my first introduction to his work. I really enjoyed it. The opening pages draw you into a story that promises more.   The story was simple, and although there were startling revelations, it was not hard to follow. Penn Cage, attorney/novelist/widow returned to his hometown following a sensational trial and victory, to raise his daugher in a small town wholesome environment. Penn sits on the school board of his old school with his good friend/doctor/Golden Boy Drew Elliott. There is even mention of Drew saving Penn's life when they were young, and they have been friends ever since. From all appearances, Drew and Penn have it all. They are wonderfully successful, have great reputations, wonderful children and are the movers and shakers in the town.  They have it all...one would think until one event spins both of their lives out of control,,,the rape/murder of a "pregnant" Kate Townsend. Kate is the beautiful, valedictorian who was scheduled to attend Harvard. From her death, we learn that Drew has done the unthinkable, he has been carrying on an affair with his 17 year old babysitter, Kate, who he intended to leave Natchez and be with until her untimely demise. He, he confides is trapped in a marriage with a woman who is addicted to painkillers, and the only thing keeping them together is his son. Through a series of twists and turns, the readers finds Drew and Penn facing armed blackmailers, and fighting for their lives (Penn's from a crazed drug dealer and Drew, who is tried for capital murder, where the sentence could be death).   There are a host of complicated characters: Mia Burke (Penn's babysitter who he finds himself attracted to but not willing to cross the line. She is also the amateur sleuth who helps him eventually unravel the case. She is also Kate's rival,in love and school.); Sunny (a bitter, racist cop, whose own ambitions will eventually be his downfall); Shad Johnson (the Black District Attorney who has political ambitions to be Mayor); Cyrus (ex-military/drug dealer/obsessed with Kate); Marco (a drug dealer/war refuge who sees life through the terrifying eyes of a child who saw and experienced too much); Kaitlin (Penn's girlfriend who doesn't like small town living) and several others.   There were some parts in the story that I would have liked to know more about, but overall, this novel had everything for a successful story.  Natchez, although it appears small and quiet (25,000 residents and dropping) is a hot-bed of secrets and desires. You eventually learn that there are sexual exploits (among teens and adults), forbidden love triangles, drugs, racial tension, blackmail plots,and death. Everything is not what it seems.   I really enjoyed this novel, and know that you will too.  
 Forget what you may have heard , this cd (DIRECTOR) is off the chain all songs are great to me. All of them have great beats he did a awesome job on this cd 
 My son got this truck as a Christmas present and he plays with it every day...he loves to look in the window and turn the crank that makes the mixer spin. He looks at the 'engine' and pushes it all over the house. He's 22 lbs. and sits on the mixer daily and it's still as good as new 
 David Foster, who wrote a few tunes on Yes's "Time and a Word" is here on bass with Tony Kaye on the B3 and it's the performance of their lives captured live at the Rainbow. A brave but good way to record a debut album, album was produced by Jon Anderson and the cover drawn by Roger Dean, just like Yes. It gives you feeling that Tony left Yes on good terms when Rick Wakeman stepped in 
 White Hunter, Black Heart seems even more impressive today than when it came out, and certainly didn't deserve its fate as the biggest box-office disaster of Eastwood's career - the same year's unsuccessful release of The Rookie took ten times more money and even Pink Cadillac outgrossed it (and that never got released outside the US). Interestingly, it seems well aware of it's problem for a main stream audience and goes out of its way to prepare them for the huge shift of tone in the last reels, setting up its own dark ending with its wonderfully written and performed early arguments about lousy little gods deciding who lives or dies in the movies. Indeed, the first half is so much fun that you tend not to notice its setting up some big issues along the way - racism, anti-Semitism, honesty, obsession and above all morality. Morality and responsibility ignored in favor of indulgence and impulse, however charismatic and entertaining it may seem, run throughout the film as Eastwood's John Huston - sorry, John Wilson - sets out to commit "the only sin you can buy a license to commit."   It's easily Eastwood's most unusual and atypical performance, abandoning his own screen persona for a large as life approximation rather than an impersonation of John Huston: the vocal cadences are there but downplayed, along with the vainglory and self-awareness. It's a fine performance and just his bad luck that Angelica Huston was on the Cannes jury that year. (African Queen co-producer John Woolf also went out of his way to damn the film as `irresponsible lies' despite its admission that its fiction.) Visually the best looking of Eastwood's films as a director, possibly because it's shot in daylight for once (Eastwood has often commented on not having plastic surgery: true, but he does tend to turn all the lights out in interior scenes instead!), but also because the visual design is so interesting, particularly as Wilson increasingly sets himself apart from the rest of the cast and crew, relegated to brooding in foreground shadows. Impressive stuff, and very entertaining with it - and a quick nod to George Dzundza's thinly-disguised Sam Spiegel while I'm at it.  The widescreen 1.85:1 DVD transfer is good, but the only extra is a brief trailer 
 This book features a selection of Roman and Greek myths, in addition to several short summaries of stories such as the Iliad, the Alliad, and the Oddesy. In addition, it contains many passages from such poets as Homer,  Shakespeare, and several others of a more modern origin. Written in fine,  if rather flowery script, this book portrays its myths just as one would  assume the ingenious writers and story tellers who created them would like  them to be told. A vast accomplishment, this document has been printed and  reprinted ever since it was first written over a hundred years ago. Every  known god or  goddess is allotted their tales, which include various  versions, stating the details that differ from version to version. Colorful  descriptions of each deity are accompanied by a complete list of their many  different names. Both new and old versions of the book are still available.  As an added bonus, it does not have a bias towards other religions, but  approaches the subject in a slightly more scientific manner 
 This book is a very good place to start for those who want to learn about the design and analysis of clinical trials. However there is a heavy emphasis on statistics - a basic knowledge of stats is essential 
 We love these bibs.  They wash up easily and fold up really small for easy packing.  They're soft, light, and totally water proof 
 I purchased this book in preparation for my first trip to the Philippines.  I found the book very resourceful and full of interesting tid-bits.  I'm leaving this month, so I will not know how practical the book is until then.  However, everyone has picked it up off my coffee table and enjoys looking through it.  Compared to other travel books that I have looked at, this one has been the most informative and organized 
 Dr. No is the classic Bond adventure novel. It has the suspense, the adventure, the exotic hideout, the interesting plan for world domination, and of course the girl. The story begins like all the other 007 rendezvous' in the Secret Service Headquarters and ends quite the same as well with Bond having saved the world and gotten the girl.   All the classic characters tell their story in this book. There is of course, audacious, adventurous, witty, and never boring James Bond, or as he says Bond... James Bond. The Bond babe that is found on the beaches near Jamaica is named Honey. She is different, interesting, at some times helpful, and you know the other thing. The original villain in Dr. No is obviously Dr. No. He has his times of genius, his psychotic thoughts, and his strange story of how he came to where he is now and all the mean things that people did to him. Nothing new there but nevertheless an interesting character.  This book is definitely a page-turner. It is packed with action, loaded with suspense, and never boring. Like any other 007 novel there are interesting twists and turns, death attempts, murders, and all the other stuff that makes the Secret Service so exciting. If you want an easy read that doesn't spend 30 pages talking about waterfalls and orchids this book is good for you. It's definitely not a classic but it sure is a Bond classic.     
 Considered by many to be Graham Greene's best work, "The Power and the Glory" deals with a familiar theme, the power and mystery of faith. In a fictional province of Mexico, religion has been banned, and the last priest is on the run. But he's not the stuff of which martyrs are made--he's a "whiskey priest" who has fathered a child. Now even his people despise him for his sins, and fear the danger he brings to their villages. Too afraid to just give himself up, half-hoping to get caught, the priest wanders from town to town, by chance just avoiding discovery. It's almost hard to see why the government searches for him so avidly.   Mysteriously Greene sets this pathetic character on the road to real holiness. The priest comes to see his past life as petty and complacent, and realizes how much he despised his parishoners and was driven by ambition. At the same time he struggles with his inability to repent of the great sin of fatherhood--against all reason he irrationally loves the dirty little girl he meets only once during his wanderings. But he comes to see God's image in every man, even the despicable character who picks him up on a trail through the forest, who the priest knows will betray him. And he repents of his true sin--selfishness, lack of love and compassion, lack of humility. Although he doesn't know it the priest is a martyr and a saint at the end--perhaps a real martyr and saint cannot by definition realize it. Greene's work is always challenging, and although I read this novel in college I don't think I really understood it at all. But there's a reason this is a masterpiece--it's a thought-provoking work from a true master 
 This is a powerful book. I am particularly pleased to have it available now, since I am very nearly sixty, and have watched as all the crosses burn on the front yard of feminism. The book points out with great care and good humor how discrimination happens so subtly those who live within it can't manage to determine what is happening. The modern insistence on coupledom, with partner search as a primary activity, resolves nothing, but does serve to line the pocketbooks of everybody from Oscar de la Renta to the Avon lady. The book provides backup statistics and rational argument for those who want to throw away the plastic surgeon's card and suggest their parents, children, and community shut up and treat them with the level of respect they've earned regardless of their "partner" status 
 This was a really amazing book.  When I first picked it up I had a hard time not seeing the people from the movie in my mind but eventually I got past that and really loved it.  The book is always better.  
             The common problem with a coming of age novel is that they are usually outdated, only covering topics that teenagers dealt with at a certain point in time. By reading outdated coming of age novels, English classes and their students are being done a disservice. Books like Catcher in the Rye and A Separate Piece have been acclaimed to all sorts of writing honors; however, the teenagers of America deserve a more recent piece of literature. Honestly, reading and deeply analyzing coming of age novels written before the 90's has proven to be as obsolete as an 8-track player. It's not that the books are not good; they're just not helping the students of today. A good coming of age novel needs references to current issues, a strong voice and an even stronger captive nature to keep the students reading rather than searching long and hard for spark notes. The coming of age novel that the students deserve is possible, and there is proof. Through the writing of Russell Banks the call for a more modern coming of age novel has been answered in the form of Rule of the Bone. Qualities depicted in the style of writing that Russell Banks uses connect the coincidental nature of life (how certain things just fall into place) in a writing style that teenagers try to escape after grammar school, while also captivating a strong audience who want to read the book from front to back.  	 Rule of the Bone is set in the mid 90's following a teenage boy, Chappie, who is in the process of finding himself. Like most coming of age novels, the protagonist is facing many life-altering decisions. What set Rule of the Bone apart from the rest of the pack is that eventually Chappie's choices lead up to him becoming a brand new character. There are no more references back to past decades; this is vital because frankly, some students are clueless about what has gone on in the world before they were alive. Today, pop culture should play crucial role in many stories; peer pressure, drugs, sex, and rebellion shape various novels and in particular Rule of the Bone. Chappie's poise around certain vices like weed and theft show America's evolution (or corruption) of its values and ways of life. "I had to unload the weed pretty much at cost to keep the bikers from buying it off of other kids...It was an interesting way of life..."(Banks, 44). Situations like these where Chappie is living with a group of bikers and dealing them weed do not come around so often in real life. The scene may seem farfetched and illogical to be in a coming of age novel (compared to previous ones) but at the same time one needs to consider that the "times they are a changing". What was hip and "bad" though out past decades may only look like minor infractions to today's world where bad is just another simile of good. This is why a coming of age novel like Rule of the Bone needs to be written. Rule of the Bone successfully represents the present yet peculiar times that some teenagers may be facing at this moment which is why so many people can find one piece of this book to relate to.  	The logic of voice in a coming of age story plays a huge part in how it is accepted among students and adults. Not only does an authors or characters voice represent the mood of the book, it also depicts plot and setting, which is very important for a reader to comprehend. Russell Banks' voice or rather Chappie's is one that can measure up to just about any emotion that makes them feel like he or she are the only one out there. "My moment of weakness had passed over me like a dark cloud...with grandma dead and Mom and my step dad moved to Buffalo...there was no more reason   for me to go there (his home town) then there was to go anywhere else in America...Things were truly grim. I'd never been so bummed. I hated doing it but it was time to take the American guy's advice. Time to head to the Mothership." (Banks 355). The feeling of loneliness and helplessness has been felt by just about anyone who has ever felt alone in their lives. Chappie is a teenager, like all of us, who is facing a series of unfortunate yet enlightening situations that are teaching him to be a better and more mature person.  Don't assume that all Chappie does throughout the book is feel weak and feeble. Due to the truthful voice of the book Chappie displays a massive array of emotion that shows that not everything in a book can go a characters way; However, when things do go in Chappie's favor (like when he meets his father) it becomes a huge surprise and sets the ROTB off in a whole new direction. 	Today, many teenagers may or may not admit to it but the books we that we read today cannot even compare to the ones we read as children. The level of fiction is far superior to that of many coming of age books written. When we teenagers were young, we thrived on fiction and fantasy. The unrealistic outcomes of some stories were so farfetched that we believed them, kept reading and waited for the next volume in the series to come out. As we grow up that quality begins to fade in the books offered by English classes. The genre of fiction is still alive but the intensity of it can in no way compare to that of in our childhood. This was until ROTB. Russell Banks brings back the fantasy aspect of the fictional-reality found in coming of age novels. "I remembered him from when I was with him all the time and he was still married to my mom and life was perfect. It was definitely my real father!"(Banks 271). When Chappie comes across his father in Jamaica it seems rather outrageous because the chances of finding one's "run-out" father in America let alone the world are one in a million, yet Banks sees it fit to have Chappie run into his father. This tactic of "possibility" that Banks uses keeps the reader wanting to read more and more because it only gives a hint at what else Chappie may come across. There's a little child in all of us and Russell Banks uses his words and plot to help us find that child once again while tying it to a bigger picture that has the mature person in us wanting to read right along with that child.  	Though the popularity of Rule of the Bone may be argued, it is still a stepping stone towards more coming of age novels that will help English students all over realize that their books no longer need to be out dated but more in sync with today's world. By carefully using his voice to tie in more current issues facing the teens of America Banks provides a strong story that borders the lines of reality and fantasy causing one to keep ones eyes and ears open for just about anything. The actual accounts of Chappie and his search for himself may not go hand-in-hand with everyone's life but if one person can say that they've felt one feeling Chappie has then Banks' book is a success. By carefully tracing the steps of one teenage boy's life though his highs and lows Rule of the Bone shows the world that not every coming of age novel has to be so realistic and outdated but more fun and lively; because those qualities are what this generation of writing is all about. 
 This is an important book for "so called" documentary writers, photographers, and film makers. I say "so called" because we tend to think of documentary work as an accurate representation--literally the  truth. Robert Coles pretty much shoots that idea down, showing how the  background, beliefs, biases, hopes, and fears of the documentarian color  the narrative. I came away believing that the word objective is not  relevant here, and that it may be impossible to ever get at the truth. If I  read Coles right, the documentarian may, in fact, be more akin to the  literary fiction writer/photographer/film-maker, who does seem to get at  the truth. This is not to say that documentary work is futile. On the  contrary it can be potent, meaningful, and worthwhile. We may just have to  look at it differently and face up to the fact that it reflects the person  doing the documentary work as much as it does his/her subject. This is a  liberating idea. And we owe a debt to Coles for proffering it. There are  consequences, too. For instance, in the light of Coles' discovery, a lot of  critics may owe an apology to Richard Avedon, whose photographic fiction,  "In The American West," may be fine documentary work after all 
 I've looked at many, many home decorating books lately. This is the only book where the basic house and furniture looks like the mix-matched hand-me-down stuff I have. Going on a shopping trip to France for antique furniture is just not an option for me. I appreciated the everyday practical approach to design and decorating. Some of the designs are not my style but I found a lot of inspiration. I do wish the book was a little more detailed in the before and after pictures. 
 This is not only the best book on writing the college application essay, but one of the best books about writing, period.  With amazingly fresh and funny examples throughout, it shows how bored admissions officers are by the pompous, self-congratulatory essays that students often think they're supposed to write--and how those students can do much, much better.  It literally changed my daughter's life, not only because she got into the very competitive college of her choice, but because she now is a sharper, more interesting writer 
 This is one of my absolute favorite books.  It's one of those that you just cannot put down.  I don't want to ruin the end, which is the best part, but it is mind-blowing!  
 I love this book. It has helped me get through many trying times.  I now collect copies to give to people who I think could benefit from reading the book 
 ya this is good book and i can tell that everyone should read thi 
 Great. It was delivered in a timely fashion and in excellent  condition.  The content is exactly what I wanted 
 What a gem! What a fountain of knowledge!  An absolute must for those who want to be proactive with their health.  Clearly, Dr. Platt has mastered the knowledge of bio-identical hormones and how they should be used to be most effective and safe.  This book is a powerful counterpoint to mainstream medical establishment who seems not to be practicing preventative medicine.  Perhaps most striking is the positive approach which Dr. Platt is taking....YES, you can be helped.  I am here to give you the time and attention you deserve!  He is a visionary of the New Frontier.

 Reluctant as I am to write a review, noticing that this fine publication has gone unreviewed demands that I take some initiative.  It is direct, well-written, provides sound cultural and scientific analysis and is truly  enlightening.  The issue of drugs and their relationship to 21st century  society must be breached and its publication is a step in the right  direction.  A good overview of the impact the psychochemicals have had on  20th century western thought and popular culture, with proper and suitable  (not condescending or patronizing) presentations of such thinkers as  Huxley, Leary, McKenna, et al.  If you possess interest in the subject, be  it casual or serious, this book will deliver.  Let's collectively wake up 
 It is elegant looking but very fragile. We have to handle it very carefully.  Tulip shape gives a special pleasure while drinking wine in that glass. 
 Mirvis, Ayas, and Roth make an exciting story accessible to a wide range of readers. Not only are the lessons of this story applicable to the business world, they carry over to relationships of all kinds. The dramatic story of Unilever's turn-around had this reader turning the pages. It is rare to come across a book with the potential to have such a far-reaching impact on organizations and the people in them. "To the Desert and Back" ought to be required reading for leaders young and old 
 After watching one of these shows I was hooked. Unfortunately I discovered this after it was cancelled. Maybe bad advertising. How come I've never heard of such a fantastic show. Big mistake. I love the characters, music, special effects, plots. Everything was obviously done by a phenomenal team. Its like a great book with the last few pages missing. More Firefly please. 
 I truly enjoyed this book, as did my 88 year old grandmother and 66 year old aunt. Lucy has always been like a favorite family member.  This book makes you feel like she is speaking in her own words and we are so glad her family decided to publish it.  Contrasted againsted The Book by Desi Arnez, made it even more interesting.  This book gave personal insight to the struggles Lucy faced in her childhood, an endurance driven by the need to be loved, and her strong work ethic.  Far less juicy and business detail oriented than The Book, it mirrors the same respect and love Lucy and Desi shared even after they divorced. Lucy was a true lady.  It did not take much reading between the lines to see she was mindful of Desi's feelings and privacy while telling her story.    
 I bought this for my 12 year old daughter, she likes to draw, I saw her using colored pencils and  a scanner, so I looked on the web and found this. My daughter loves this, she can do a lot more with more vivid colors, she is doing some animation as well as simple drawings 
 Linda does a wonderful job of taking bible  passages and instructions and showing their practical applications for the modern wife. I've become more organized and more aware of areas I need growth in. The chapter "The  Consistent Responder" beautifully illustrates our  responsiblity for  our own behavior REGARDLESS of what our husbands do, while reassuring the  reader that God DOES in fact see your struggles, love you, and desire to  comfort you when you've been hurt. Our women's bible group is finishing up  this book right now, and it has been nothing short of a blessing in our  lives. This is a resource I'll use again and again 
 Without question the best I've yet read from this author. I could not put down this down. I found myself reading into the wee hours of the morning. The end of each page is a cliff-hanger for the next. Brilliant work brilliantly done 
 One of the most beautiful, spare, simple tales of growing up and dealing with pain and loss.   Take time with it.  It is one of the true ones 
 I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525, and have had a few problems w/it.  First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt.  Second the aluminum case isn't the sturdiest, so now it's sort of bent (referring to the hinge, I guess I've been really rough on my phone), but I just bend it back to where it's supposed to be (referring to the hinge).  But the case does what it's supposed to do...my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it.  When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip, instead I recieved a full refund, so that was a pleasant suprise.  I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone 
 This is a light duty timer which is why it does not have 3 prongs. It does what it says it does

 Delany has one of the most penetrating minds of anyone writing in English. This book should be a first resource for anyone considering writing novels--Delany discusses it as the serious pursuit that it is. I find myself reconsidering many aspects of my own writing, and not always comfortably. I'll be a better writer for it 
 Dr. Lenarz cuts through all the bull and gets to the point of chiropractic.  He puts it in terms that anyone can understand and doesn't waste words on the chiropractic system of staying healthy.  
 Plot:  I had never read an 'Alex Delaware' book before, and am always a bit leary picking up a book in a series of books because I may not understand the workings of the character built up before the novel I happen to read.  However, this book was well written and so detailed I didn't feel like I had ever missed a thing.  Written from the point of view of Alex, as well as his best friend, Milo, you really get a sense of the character's motives and flaws.  Another thing I enjoyed about this story is that it is not a predictable ending, and it didn't feel forced.  I hate when a book feels like it just hurried up and tied all the loose ends so it can wrap up.  I never got that feeling from this book, which was a joy.   From the Audio standpoint:  I have never heard an audio book where the reader did such a superb job.  I truly felt that I was listening to a variety of characters, each had their own pitch, inflection and you could hear the emotions in the voice.  I could put in a tape at random and tell you what character was speaking, even though there were well over 10 characters in this storyline.  Very well represented! 
 V: The Final Battle, in my humble opinion, is far better and more fun than the original first mini series.  Ham Tyler's character is a blast, the desperation for the resistance is more intense, the visitors seem even more menacing, the action is fast-paced, there are many fun cliff-hangers, things get resolved with everyone from the little crooked sell-out traitor teen Daniel to Stephen to Donovan's collaborator crumb/mom Eleanor.  I loved the tense moments with the "Fifth Column" and Martin.  I liked the operations the resistance ran with the medical center stuff to the water factory to the final assault on the mother ship. Contrary to what everyone says, the Final Battle has PLENTY of moralizing and lessons to learn just like the first series.  Characters get developed and we see things come full circle. Fun, exciting, worth the money. Buy this bad boy! 
 I love "Strangers With Candy" so when I saw that this book was written by the same people I just had to buy it. I first got it for my best friend and he thought it was crazy but goo, so I gave it a try. Great book, CRAZY, but halarious. If you like the show then this book has the same comedy style so give it a try 
 Biographical information about the authors and their works is included before all of the stories. This information is a little more detailed than in Dozois' The Year's Best Science Fiction and gave me a little more of an idea about the personalties of the authors. I found this particularly helpful in regard to my future reading goals as I like to pick an author and read several stories or novels by that person.  I read a library copy of the book but am tempted to buy it to keep as way to remember the names of the authors included and their works. There is also some discussion of trends, such as libertarian SF, which whetted my curiousity. On a radio program recently, I heard a current non-SF author say, "I read to learn about life."  I am always surprised how much I learn about life in the worlds of SF 
 It is A.D. 1141. A year that brings a tide of pilgrims to the Abbey.   This is the tenth mystery in the series. You may want to start from the first to let the interacting mysteries reveal themselves in chronological order. This is the second one for me after "The Morbid Taste for Bones." I do have to warn you that the synopsis to "A Morbid Taste for Bones" and "Virgin in the Ice" is played out again somewhat in the first two chapters of this book.   What can not be portrayed in the short Cadfael movies and would make marvelous reading on its own is the inter action between the forces and reasons behind the vacillating positions of Empress Maud and King Stephen. This is also a crucial part of the story; as the loyalties and logistics play a major part in the mystery and people's lives.   I will not compare and contrast the people in the story or the differences in the film adaptation as the fun is finding out for your self, all the actions and interaction of people. I will say that none of this would have been possible with out the grace of St. Winifred.  
 This book is a real page turner.  It is amazing it ever got printed, so that in itself is reason enough to pick it up and study it 
 Dr. Dobson is 100% correct in his methods.  It IS guidance by the Lord.  Showing TOUGH LOVE is the only way to help someone you love. Be it your spouse, a child or a relative.  The methods in this book are not tricks.  They delve into the psychology of what happens when someone feels "caged" in a relationship.  It's based on the well known fact "the harder you try and hold on to someone, the harder they fight to get away."  And this book is not just for Marriage issues.  Dr. Dobson lists 16 things you need to know when you enter into a relationship that can keep you from blowing it.  Had I known then what I know now, I would be upset at myself.  I blew 14 of the 16 things and it's no wonder she ran away calling me "clingy" and "soft."  I was and Dr. Dobson showed me exactly why.  This book is NO GUARANTEE that you will win your spouse or significant other back.  But, like anything else, if you don't do something you will more assuredly lose them anyway.  Pray hard and read this book if you want to keep them.  Learn to give them space.  While I may have blown my chances with my ex (and I think I have) at least I am sure I will never repeat the same mistakes again.    Single or Married, you need this book 
 This book reminds me a lot of Seabiscuit. Both books read more like novels than non fiction. Both are about events that held the nation (and world's) attention. Both give an interesting look not just at a couple key individuals but a sport as a whole.  The Perfect Mile follows three runners - Bannister, Landy, and Santee as they strive to be the first to run a sub 4:00 mile. It discusses what people thought of this (was it possible? would they die?) the training methods, and many close calls (missing the 4:00 mark by hundreths of a second.  It is very well written and will be appreciated by runners and non runners alike 
 This movie is about a Parole Officer played by Jennifer Beals who falls in love with one of her ex cons . This does not sound like a very original storyline but this movie is enhanced and redeemed by a very believable and solid performance by Jennifer Beals. Sadly we do not see enough of her in movies these days which is a real shame because I think she is one very talented , underrated actress. Bravo Ms. Beals!!! (And she is pretty HOT too!!! 
 What a dialectical post-modern absurdity that is the meaning of the life of some random people, clumped together in a multiplicity of neo-Neitzschean thought-waves.   Get what you will from this book, it is wordy--on purpose--and was written to try to piss you off. You may or may not get pissed off, but you will certainly take away something from this book: either a) it is stupid and so is D+G, or b) it is a solid critique of Freud and all those globe-controlling institutions that subliminally followed in his footsteps. 
 I really enjoyed reading the book and not only were the stories very interesting but also very inspirational.  I got a chance to meet the actual writer Michael Mink and I greatly enjoyed his view of the ladies he wrote about and some of the behind the story of writing the book. I encourage everone to read this boo 
 Spirituality and Health is a bi-monthly magazine that reports on the ideas, the people, and the practices of the current spiritual renaissance.  Featuring reviews of books, DVD's, and music, as well as lively columns and interviews, Spiritual and Health Magazine explores the mind/body connection, healing, spiritual practice, science, psychology, and more.   Here is a sample of some of the articles featured in this magazine:  *Socrates' Seven Spiritual Principles *The Healing Power of Doing Good: The New Science of Volunteering *The Standford Forgivness Project *Qi Vs. Cancer *Lessons From Mindful Corporations.  *Recovering From Infidelity *Classic Hymns Cut Through Dementia  *Spiritual Literacy in Wartime *How Plants May Explain the Intelligence of Ants   Magazine departments include book and movie reviews, gorgeous art and photographic galleries, beliefs from all walks of life and faiths, commentary by Thomas Moore, and more. One of my favorite sections is What Goes On In There, Really? which examines different worship practices. They have profiled experiences like a Pentecostal Christian service, Dances of Universal Peace, Maundy Thursday in Baghdad, Friday Night Shabbat Service, Siddha Yoga Meditation Ashram, and Spotting Elves in Iceland.   I've been a subscriber for several years now, and once I sit down to begin reading Spiritual and Health Magazine, it's hard to get up! You never feel like you're preached at; rather, this magazine offers gentle observations on contemporary culture, ancient wisdom, science, healing, personal growth, new discoveries, and spirituality--with breathtaking color photographs placed throughout. This magazine is truly a visual feast, as well as food for the soul 
 Eve takes it to the edge with Scorpion! She writes her own lines and you can tell with the emotion and the truth she speaks, she tells it like it is. THe 2nd track/1st song 'Cowboy' is a great opening andshe keeps it up throughout the whole album. I definatly recommend this to anyone 
 The only people who can dismiss a book like this are the misguided followers of the hypocritical cult leader, Sun Myung Moon.  As an atheist who currently attends the University of Bridgeport, I ate this book up in a day.  It bears striking resemblance to Jon Krakauer's "Under the Banner of Heaven," which documents the underpinnings of another cult, Warren Jeffs' FLDS of Colorado City, AZ.  I should be careful in my use of the term 'cult,' however.  What is a cult?  What is a religion?  They are the same entity.  That judgment simply lies in the eyes of the beholder.  Just as Nansook Hong points out in the epologue, all religions claim that their way is the true path to heaven.  The only difference between major religions like Roman Catholicism and Judaism, and 'cults' such as the FLDS, Jonestown, and the Unification Church is their size and level of acceptance by the public.  In this way, the Pope and Sun Myung Moon are both equals.  They are both equally nothing.  It is clearly obvious that Sun Myung Moon is a madman who takes advantage of the socially vulnerable.  This is he has such a hatred for communism - he preys on those affected by tragedy by giving them some type of bright future to look forward to.  He prays on the weak.  He is a con man.  He claims to have spoken directly to Jesus in Korea as a young man, and has duped thousands around the world into believing he IS the second coming.    The extremely brave Nansook Hong stood up for herself and left the Moon Compound to have a better life for herself and for her children.  Any unificationist who claims to be a loving human being who would argue with her motives needs to look deep inside themselves.  Sun Myung Moon's son Hyo Jin is an awful person.  Nansook writes about being arranged in a marriage as a 15 year old girl, being coerced into coming to America as an illegal alien, being held against her will at East Garden, being abused, raped, and cheated on by the supposed 'Son of the Second Coming of Jesus,' and having to put up with drugs, alcohol abuse, and neglect for fourteen years of her life.  Sun Myung Moon preaches to his followers about the importance of family and lineage, while his own dysfunctional family is the only one he should be paying any attention to.  It is even documented in this biography as well as many other publications that Sun Myung Moon himself cheated on his wife and has a child with another woman.  Both Sun Myung Moon and his eldest son are criminals, and need to be locked up.  In my opinion, Moon got off light with his one year in prison for tax evasion.    Unfortunately, I can hear the unificationsists already in my mind dismissing this book as 'the work of satan,' as I am going to try to show it to them next week.  All I can really do is educate as many people as possible about how mentally ill and irresponsible Sun Myung Moon is and hope that his end is nearing...before more unfortunate people like Nansoon Hong are forced into a world of destruction at the hands of this 'True Family.'    
 dont get me wrong, I love Mary and the whole Factory entourage, and I get the way Mary wrote this book.  But it still was a bit confusing.  Anyone who wasnt familiar with the scene and didnt know who was who would be lost 
 Checking my shipping status from work it says "Delivered"...sadly I must wait four more hours until Im off work! hmm I think Im starting to feel sick *cough* *cough* maybe I should go home 
 This is most definitely one of the greatest CDs of all time.  AMG is at his best and the Teenage Pimp definately lets you know about it.  Every  song has great bass and rhythm and who can argue with AMG's lyrics?  When  you're a Pimp, you're a Pimp...what can you do other than get it all day,  every day?  I definitely recommend this CD to all rap fans and even non-rap  fans...it's quite hard to come by, so get it while you can and have a  "Vertical Joyride" of your own "When She Calls".  And  also I have the same question which LaQueeda Jenkins from Cleveland, Ohio  has, "Who does DJ Quik's hair?&quot 
 This book was recommended to me by a friend who knew I had grown up in the midwest.  It definitely brought back a few memories!  I laughted out loud at several parts.  It was sweet and yet had an underlying sadness that is understood only now that we are adults.  one of the best books that I have read in awhile 
 Absolutley brilliant science writing as we have come to accept from Dawkins. I am a physicist and i read dawkins to remind myself how to explain difficult ideas to non specialists. A collection of riveting tales. With respect to his religious views; dawkins provides a service, he makes lazy agnostice rationlists like myself get off my butt and say what is glaringly obvious. This is just what the planet needs at this momen 
 This band blew my mind when I first listened to them. If you are looking for something new and exciting, and are kind of bored of whatever's coming out these days, give it a try. If you aren't into Avant-garde music, you might have to give it a few listens, but even then you will like it 
 As always, a beautiful reflection of the depth of profound religious feeling of the late middle ages. Hopefully books such as these will allow us to understand the beauty of the art as well as thought that was dedicated to higher aspirations for life itself 
 I want to see this movie so bad!My sister has Brietta the horse,the cloud kingdom,and Rayla the cloud Queen.Her face looks kind of wierd but this doll looks really pretty!ESPESAILLY the dress color!It`s a light pale pink!Her crown is GORGEOUS to the extreme!I reccomend her tottaly 
 I'm a universitary professor and I found that Mr. Kennan did an excellent job in this matter. Highly recommended for music students and professional musicians in general. The chapters dedicated on the subjects of scoring for each section of the orchestra are a jewel 
 Like all great French romances, there's more than a little melodrama here, but what a beautiful movie. I love every character and every scene is gorgeous. 
 What I would like to see is a cleverly packaged CD of the Beatles White album in mono which was never officially released in the U.S. in any form. Of course, it would be on the Apple label. There are no known mono versions of Let it Be or Abbey Road. There are however, mono versions of the White album and Yellow Submarine 
 I love every single song on this CD... The soloist on O Tannenbaum, Timothy Stalter, is hands down the finest tenor I have ever heard, as well as my current choir conductor and one hell of a teacher. When he stops us to demonstrate a line, we all freeze, and silently listen to the soft, sweet voice that comes from his mouth. GET THIS CD 
 I bought this CD a few years ago and it's just a amazing collection... This is a really good list until you get to the last 4 songs which sound like filler. You have "Is this love" which is Whitesnakes best song IMO... You have "Can you take me high enough" which is a really good song and I like the solo ALOT. "Wind of Change" is one of The Scorpions best songs as Carrie is pretty good also. If you enjoy 80's hair bands this album is for you 
 That we've made it all the way from Constantinople to the outskirts of Paris is no small wonder.  Vampires travel poorly in the light and require good support systems if they are not to alarm the countryside.  White Wolf's vampire series tend to ignore the human world that is not in service to the dark, but it is out there, and the wonderful world of light tight hearses and high speed trains is 700 years away.  But the pilgrims have made it, Anatole has exposed the heretics, and for now the focus shifts to the world within the gates.  There, Alexander rules as prince of the city, the devious Lady Saviarre is his consort, and baroque plots and power plays are the rule of the day.  Prince Alexander may be 1000 years old, but his grip on the city has weakened.  Not far from Paris the Queens of Love plot revenge for an old wrong, sending both the Brujah Veronique and the Toreador Rosamund on separate diplomatic missions.  This is a deep game played by true ancients and the outcome will shake the night in Paris.  Veronique and Rosamund are both pawns in this game aimed at creatng weak points at which others can strike.  Veronique is the hardened manipulator who avoids the limelight, and Rosamund fills the part of ingénue, aimed at Alexander's heart.  And below the city in the vaults of the Nosferatu, Mnemach queen of the disfigured and unnerving undead begins to work her own revenge.  Veronique treads carefully, but her blood runs with political intrigue.  Unlike others of her clan, she has learned to be subtle as well as deadly as she plays for final advantage in the nights of Paris to come.  As this series has moved north, it has become less a vampire story and more a tale of times that were, indeed, a nightmare of political power struggles - human or vampire.  In the backdrop living rulers drive crusades in a search for wealth and the Church declares it's own pogrom against the Cathars.  Other similar conflicts dot the European landscape, and if vampires didn't have unusual feeding requirements the characters of this story would be indistinguishable from the nobility they imitate.  That is really my sole criticism of this volume and several others in the series.  I sometimes get the feeling that the players of the game are trying to turn it into a history game instead of a narrative that is founded on a deep layer of gothic terror.  these vampires are too much like there human counterparts.  I would like more spookiness, more occult, and just a bit more graphic violence.  That said, Myranda Kalis writes well and the ending of the book is almost everything one could ask.  My curiosity about the long term goal of the series is aroused as well 
 A welcome addition in a lovely box with all the beauty of great sound,a 90 page book, a great disc of live material/broadcasts makes this a needed addition to any Basie lover..I also have the Columbia's Essential collections spanning 3 discs but this here is a needed bonus and is still not a substitute for those under rated discs put out earlier...Such a prolific man deserves royal treatment and does some justice to the earlier output..but obviously other reviewers will give you more detail as to songs selection and musicians I just wanted to add appreciation. 
 As an avid fan of comics, I love that the genre continues to bring touching surprises. WE3 is one such unexpected treasure, as the story follows three former pets modified by the government to serve as living weapons. Scheduled to be destroyed in favor of the next version of "hardware," their trainer/doctor releases them, and the animals set off for "home" out of some vague memory of being pets.   Though their communication is limited, the humanity within the animals is sincere and heartrending, especially as the the dog struggles with his ability to be a "gud dog" while inadvertantly killing the humans he longs to protect. The imagery is harsh, violent and often emotionally painful to look at, but still gorgeous in its composition and realism. If you've ever owned a pet, or even have half a heart, don't be surprised if the ending has you in tears and in search of a golden retriever to hug.   WE3 has a unique ability to connect to our very idea of what it is to be moral, how we see the nature of animals reflected in ourselves, and reminds us that good and evil are definitively a luxury exclusive to humans. All in all I'm simply upset that WE3 was so short, but perhaps in this case brevity was the soul of humanity 
 After a decade of falling further down the charts, Cheap Trick came bouncing back towards the top with 1988's Lap of Luxury. By 1988 Cheap Trick hadn't had a hit record or single in years, but Lap of Luxury changed that. Lap of Luxury briefly brought Cheap Trick back into the spotlight. While Lap of Luxury is not Cheap Trick's best album it does have quite a bit to offer however. Lap of Luxury spawned the hit powerballad "The Flame", and a cover of Elvis Presley's "Don't Be Cruel." Other highlights include: "Ghost Town", Let Go, and Never Had a Lot to Lose 
 With the identity of Deep Throat now known, All the President's Men has an added bit of excitement.  I couldn't help but think, "wasn't it obvious?" as I read it and thought of Deep Throat's true identity.  Reading it, I realized that Woodward and Bernstein didn't try to hide the secret as well as all the speculation over the last 30 years would lead one to believe.  Don't be like the taxi driver I had late one night in D.C. this summer who said he didn't need to read this book because "I lived through it."  Man that guy was a jerk.  He would not shut up 
 I've been using this with my teenager. I have a good religious foundation and love the explanations, stories, thoughts, etc. Every Catholic school shoud expose their students to this Bible 
 The writing contained in this novel is the finest I have ever read. Like Alice slipping down the rabbit hole, you won't be able to stop yourself. I just shake my head when I hear of people who put this book down --unfinished -- in utter frustration. I don't know what stops them, perhaps they are intimidated by a person who can write page after page of unbelievably beautiful prose without breaking a sweat. I can't explain it; I only know that this is a place I can't wait to visit again 
 I kept hearing Independence Day on Sean Hannity so went searching for her.  I'm happy discovering a overall excellent listening CD 
 Well, damn, she wasn't kidding.  This book was recommended by a good friend/ I will start by saying that the dust jacket certainly does not lend to what the book will be about in full. I have been trying to formulate the words for this spot for a month. I actually read this book before The Bell Jar (#32).   Into your life you let Sarah Laden, recently widowed and raising two sons, on her own, while run her in-home catering business.  Into your life you let sons, Danny and Nate Laden. Danny, a quiet, reserved 5th grader who never [seems] to do wrong. Nate, the older brother and the rebellious teenager, sometimes leaves Sarah with her hands in the air.   Into your life you let Mark and Courtney Kendrick, Sarah's' best friends and neighborhood "neighbors". Courtney a pediatrician and Mark a complete scoundrel, who disappears, the day Sarah finds Jordan home, alone, walking to school in the rain.   Sarah stops by Courtney's and sees Jordan walking to school in the down pouring rain. After a few attempts at ordering him into the car, he submits. While driving to school Jordan appears sick and she pulls over to a rest stop where he vomits and runs to a port-o-john. After many minutes of him not returning Sarah walks to the port-o-john where Jordan does not answer. Sarah opens the door to find Jordan on the floor with a hypodermic needle. The eleven year old appears to have attempted suicide. Sarah rushes him to the hospital, Mark disappears, Courtney is taken away by the police and the entire Laden family is left wondering where to start healing themselves and everyone else in their lives.   A book of healing, love, forgiveness and regret. Powerful, written well, but a tough read do to the emotions brought to the surface, but worth every second.  Outstanding! 5. 
 It is certainly THE BIBLE for construction. Boy, I sweated it! But, if you can get through it, it is certainly worth the efford 
 Karen and her friend Ian join an ice skating class. karen  thinks its to easy, but later Karen's teacher askes her and Ian to be in a skating show they say yes but Karen is sick of skating! She can't hang out with her friends anymore! Does she really have what it takes to be a skating star? Read this book and find out 
 Until the publication of this book, Pseudo-Dionysius, a major influence on Meister Eckhart and John of the Cross, among others, was like a tantalizing mirage, frequently referred to but generally not seen in full. Finally, here he is. The book contains "The Divine Names", "The Mystical Theology", "The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy", "The Celestial Hierarchy", and letters. In addition, there are three (!) introductions, to tell us about Pseudo-Dionysius in later antiquity, the middle ages, and the reformation. The translations are modern, well-annotated, and clear inasmuch as this is possible. One of the introductory writers comments that many readers are surprized at how short these works are, because they may seem long due to the dense writing style. As for content, Pseudo-Dionysius attempted to wed the Neoplatonism of Plotinus and Proclus with the Bible and Christian practice. The reader will have to judge how successful this effort actually is, but it probably helps account for the survival of these works through many heresy purges. The result translated here is interesting in a historical sense and useful in a spiritual sense. The discussion of evil in "The Divine Names" is particularly fascinating, if difficult. And for those who wonder about angel theory, well, "The Celestial Hierarchy" has it all. It is very good to finally be able to read these works in their entirety 
 David Korn is the father of the Korn Shell; he's brilliant. This book is a very fine reference book, but the writing style is not for absolute beginners. Korn shell users might want to also consider "Korn Shell: Programs for Your Survival at Work" by Larry L. Smith. Some of the examples in Randal K. Michael's "Mastering UNIX Shell Scripting" are also helpful 
 This is a great reference book for anyone who is interested just in birds that can be found in Florida. The drawings have enough detail that most birders from beginner to advanced intermediate should find them useful. I used this book for the first few years of birding and found it to be of great value. Many people may attempt to compare this to Sibley's Guides but I would have to say that each has its advantages. Sibley's often has too much detail and does not show just the birds that you may see in one specific area. This book show only Florida birds and groups them in a logic fashion that allows for fast reference. If you are in Florida bird watching (I strongly suggest it!) then you should find this book useful. This is not a replacement for the Sibley Guide but more of a quick reference book that can be used as the primary source. Go to Sibley's Guides for fine details when in doubt but unless you know exactly where to find each bird, this guide will be less frustrating 
 I've had this book for about 6 months now.  I've read it, and I've worked through about a third of the code samples.    This book starts of with an intro on programming languages that touches on issues relevant to C, C++, Perl, Java, C#, and others that vulnerability researchers might be interested in.  The 2nd chapter on NASL (Nessus) scripting is a little sparse, but is suitable for a quick reference.    The next three chapters are devoted to BSD, Windows, and Java sockets respectively.  The information provided is good enough to code working sockets in all three.  The BSD code samples seem to work okay.    The next two chapters are on writing portable code and portable network programming.  These are probably two of the best chapters in this book.  If I ever got heavy into vulnerability coding, I'd be referring to these.    The next two chapters are on writing shellcode.  These are pretty good chapters.  One issue with these chapters is that the author's  s-proc program doesn't quite seem to work.  This is a utility that prints your shellcode in hex (-p option) or executes the code to test it (-e option).  This would come in handy indeed.  I have some working shellcode, but I never got it to work with s-proc -e in chapter 9.  I e-mailed the author twice, but he did not respond.  I subtract one star for that.  Still these chapters have some cool ideas for shellcode.    There are three chapters on writing exploits.  The first two are kind of a whirlwind tour of traditional exploit issues (format string, stack & heap overflows, integer bugs).  The last chapter is an introductory chapter on using Metasploit and an overview of how to write exploits for the framework.    The last two chapters are on writing security components, and writing a security tool.  They are Microsoft centric, and I didn't roll up my sleeves and get into these.    This book brings together a lot of information in a single volume.  This would make a great reference, for someone who doesn't have books covering all the other subjects.  The chapters on porting are probably the most valuable and unique.  There are also some really cool ideas in the chapters on shellcode.  There are a few other cool things sprinkled throughout.  Plenty of code samples; they are available from the publisher for download if you register the book.  The index is really pretty good and suitable for reference.  I give back the star I previously took away for that.  This is nice as a reference and tutorial 
 This book tries really hard to be both a learning guide for beginners and a reference book for more experienced learners, and I must say the outcome is a big success. For each of the 2000 kanji it contains there are a big picture in brush calligraphy, plus one or two smaller versions drawn with a ballpoint pen, quite a useful thing to see. After the various pronunciations there is a symbolic guide to the connection between the picture and the meaning, explaining whether the kanji is a diagrammatic picture of what it represents, or if the connection is  with other characters with similar pronunciation, etc. Finally, a couple of example expressions are provided. All pronunciations are given in romanj. This is at least surprising for a book of such worth, but it is not much of an issue. As a beginner I would have liked kana better so that I could practice with those as well, but of course there is no real practical drawback in rendering a syllabic system in one way or the other 
 It has been some time since I saw this flick, but it is a must see for anyone who has not seen it 
 I picked Tyson's book from a suggestion from my good friend.  It was an amazing look at the Civil Rights movement, unlike any I have ever seen or read before.  Tyson makes absolutely no excuse and tells his story without reservation.   I read this book for a history class, but would suggest it to anyone.  It was a great read 
 this one i think is pretty good, much better than ''weird revolution'' this one got me into the butthole surfers  12 albums ago. not their best but still a good album 
 This book is what I've been looking for: a book that teaches you HOW to teach social skills and organization skills for kids that just don't pick it up from interactions in everyday life. It's made a big difference in our everyday family and school life for my 2 ADHD/LD kids. My thanks to Rick Lavoie 
 Excellent book. Very well written. I would recommend a must read for everyone 
 I had forgotten all about this movie!   I was shopping for a copy of "Wizards" and found this. I saw it in the theater when it first was introduced.  The DVD took me back - the sound and quality were beyond words! Several animated mini stories tied together with the mysterious evil green orb.  The movie can best be summed with the unspoked phrase, "Don't call me 'Bitch'. 
 That's because I was given this book 64 years ago when I was six years old! (It was originally published in 1942.)I just looked it up on Amazon.com thinking I might find another used copy in better condition than mine and I find that Twig still lives on in the lives of a new generation of children!  The story is charming but it is the illustrations that make the story come alive. No credit is listed for an illustrator so perhaps the author did them herself? The drawings are mostly in black and white but a few are touched with color.   The story is that of Twig, a little girl who meets a tiny boy in her backyard. Through magic she shrinks down to size of the boy named Elf. Elf is actually a  Brownie who has flown in on the back of a sparrow. Twig and Elf set up housekeeping in an upturned tomato can and furnish it with a table (a thimble and a bottle top,) a mirror (a shiny gum wrapper) and a broom (a feather). I have to say that not a lot happens in this book. No violence or bloodshed, and not even any enemies for Twig and Elf to fight. This is a gentle story and yet an enduring one.  Every household with children should have a copy of this book 
 "Every woman is in some way searching for or running from her beauty and every man is looking for or avoiding his strength.  Why?  In some deep place within, we remember what we were made to be....we carry with us the memory of image-bearers walking in the Garden.  We long for intimacy because we were made in the image of perfect intimacy.  So why do we flee our essence?  As hard as it may be for us to see our failures, it is far harder still for us to remember our glory.  The pain of the memory of our former glory is so excruciating, we would rather stay in the pigsty than return to our true home." (page 95)  I read this book several years ago, when I was at a place in my spiritual walk where I was questioning my relationship with God.  I am not easily impressed with modern literature, but this book made me dissolve into tears, laugh with utter abandon and rededicate myself to knowing God on the deepest level possible.  It isn't an epic.  It isn't lengthy.  Yet the profound truths and spiritual depths contained therein makes this book an immediate classic.  This book reveals the true ageless tale that begins, "Once upon a time...and ends, "And they lived happily ever after."  But, thankfully, it isn't a fairy tale.  It is a true story of God in relationship and His heroic intimacy...intimacy beyond our wildest imagination.  Like the shimmer of sunlight on a lake, these are reflections of the love that flows from God to us...His beloved.  It is a story of an eternal romance that will carry your heart away...and make you ache for the kind of love for which you have dreamed....for which you were created 
 This is a great album.  You can put this in your CD player and just let it play.  Heavy D was so smooth in his delivery.  He could flow on the hip hop love tracks like #2.  Don't yu know , and then party on jams like track 9.  You can't see what I can see.  Heavy talked about love when other hip hop artist were trying to be tough, or use the medium to make a political statement or raise social conscious (Public Enemy, KRS-One). Before folks get their undies in a bunch, I'm a huge fan of Public Enemy and KRS-One, but Heavy D. took Hip Hop to a different level with his hip hop love tracks.   Heavy D was one of the few hip hop artist to cross over into the pop charts.  Run DMC being the other.    Favorite Cuts: 3.  Don't you know 4.  We got our own thang - (great song for the IPOD to play at the gym) 5.  Sombebody for me 7.  Now that we found love 8.  Is it good to you 9.  You can't see what I can see - (great song for the IPOD to play at the gym) 11.  Nuttin but love 14.  On Point - (great song for the IPOD to play at the gym)  This is a great CD to have in your collection if you were a Heavy D fan like I am.  You get a nice mix of favorite songs on 1 CD.  The Overweight Lover's in da house!!! 
 Practical Home Theater cuts through the rat's nest of cables, vocabulary and acronyms to clearly present the essentials of home theater.  If you're seeking a single book -- packed with details -- that lays it out simply and coherently, look no further 
 You will think that this was photoshopped, airbrushed, other otherwise tricked up.  It's not.  These are simple, real photgraphs of dancers that are hard to believe as real.  Modern dance is something not everyone understands.  This collection will make you wonder how it is that human beings can create such kinetic sculpture with their bodies and some pieces of cloth 
 Alot of folks love to criticize Bill Cooper. I personally think he was reporting truths from his experiences & information he got his hands on.  He claims right up front that some info may not be accurate.  He NEVER claims to be 100% accurate, and gives you his sources for the info, not just opinions.  He took a stand to expose secret information he felt the public should know.  Whether you agree with him or not, you've got to respect the man. He fought to get this book published & ultimately lost his life holding on to that "stand".  It's risk-takers like him that gives us knowledge & information to see hidden truths.  Thank you & God Bless you, Bill.  Rest in Peace.          
 Looking at several of the reviews already posted, the real value of this book is being missed. To see this book as being about automotive design misses the point altogether. This is a book to celebrate the largely untapped potential of focusing on design 'outside' of a particular market. The fact that the charter of the group specifically had to allow for the design of things 'other' than cars/vehicles, was to keep the problem-solving perspectives of the designers 'fresh' and 'exercised'.  Design is a fundamental principle that applies to the most critical aspects of the success of ANY business: optimizing relationships (the lifeblood of an enterprise's existence). The touchpoints at which any individual interacts with a business (whether customer, employee, supplier...) can all be optimized with thoughtful design considerations (it's not just about products).  Read Hirshberg and look 'beyond' the immediate problem. The principles are fundamental. Hirshberg does a great job of illustrating the principles within the context of his own experiences 
 Ideal for someone with no experience of raising ducks.  Covered everything and was easy to understand 
 A coworker referred me to this book - recommended 
 My son, who just turned two, heartily enjoys this toy.  The only major complaint I have about it is that while it has compartments on both sides of the "canvas" for storing the crayons, those compartments are not easy for me to open, much less a 2-year old. The compartments have an indentation where one is presumably supposed to squeeze and open the chamber, but it doesn't work so well for us. This has actually become a little maddening and frustrates my little one. A small quibble, but it would be great if this toy were slightly modified to make the compartments a little easier to get in to 
 I have never found a book containing so much information about food in all of its forms.  We sometimes sit for an hour reading something we didn't open the book for.  For example it was very interesting reading about how california figs depend on a very small wasp; to grow figs depends on two fields of figs, one edible and one not edible.  I was referred to this book by Alton Brown of Good Eats / Food Network.  
 Thanx for putting out the book.It was THE christmas present for my hubby ;}  It's great to ride by the "shop". Always a head jerker...Billy, at 2 am, do our Melb. cops harass y'all? I'm just really curious.. 
 I've always thought this is a great textbook on basic Chinese medicine. I wish more schools used it as their basic introductory text. The material is authoritative and the terminology is accurate. I think you get a lot of value for your money with this book. I far prefer it to Giovanni Maciocia's Foundations book. This book could solve a lot of the problems in the TCM schools in North America. 
 A touching movie of a love story through time with outstanding performances of the two main characters which is really worth watching and buying. I definitely recommend it to all those who like to watch quality movies 
 I bought this book at the beach and read it in 2 days!!!  Great book.  It reminded me of Indiana Jones,The DaVinci Code and Clive Cussler books all rolled into one book.  Don't pass this one up 
   I first would like to respond to the person who rates this book as Poorly Done.  Maybe poorly done has good reasons of her own to stay married to a gay man.  Maybe he is rich and she is enjoying secondary gains.  Who knows?  But I would like to tell her we are not all in the same situation.  When a heterosexual woman, with all of her female hormones in balance, marries a man, she is well hoping, in most cases, that he is heterosexual and ALL HERS.  She doesn't want to share with other women OR MEN.  When her man is gay and doesn't tell her this and marries her anyway.  He is stealing her life from her.  He is killing a part of her for his own benefit.  Anyone who would do such a thing to another person is also without conscience, and is an evil monster to her life.  He is just using the woman.  This is the type of woman Bonnie wrote the book to benefit.  Now maybe a lesbian woman wouldn't mind finding out her hubby is gay, indeed, such arrangements have probably been knowingly made throughtout history.  There are also women who haven't an interest in sex or hand-holding and marriage to a gay man could be a real release from the pressures of having to perform sexually.  thsi type of woman may rather be out in the mall shopping.  So, this book would not be for the lesbian or the sexually disinterested woman.  But for a woman who hopes to become truly united with her man in marriage and has been lied to, this book is a godsend of comfort. Thank you Bonnie for your book.  I have been trying to ignore my grievous situation for 15 years...now with your help I Can try to make a life for myself.  From all that I see there are so many varieties of gay men out there...I would never, never get married again 
 I bought this for my son for his eighth birthday, he loves it so much that he is reading it to himself. This is the first book that he has ever carried around with him, actually reading while he is walking around. This was the first chapter book that my older son read. We had barrowed a paperback edition from a friend. I am so glad that I bought this edition, it's a great story, and the illustrations are wonderful! My younger son got a bike, game cube,and game boy games, for his birthday. But, this book is favorite gift... I think that says it all 
 It looks very good.    Potatoes and some beans.   Delicious sauce.   I put over a chicken cutlet for dinner last night.   It was great 
 This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while.  And it's a movie you can watch with the entire familyn without worrying about something being offensive to someone.  I loved it because it talks about adversity which is what everyone faces at some point in their lives (if they live long enough).  I really liked the way they incorporated prayer and Biblical advice in the movie.  It's a movie I wouldn't mind buying and having around to see for years to come 
 Among all the country songs my mother played around the house when I was growing up, "Help Me Make It Through the Night" by Sammi Smith still plays often in the "jukebox in my mind", so to speak.  When this song was popular in 1970, my dad was a Navy submariner who went out to sea on patrols 6 months out of the year, leaving my mom to hold down the fort caring for me and my younger sister, keeping house, paying bills, on top of holding down a full-time job herself as a buyer for Sears--not to mention living a continent away from our other relatives on the West Coast!  Sure, she held up all these added responsibilities well and with love, creativity, and humor, but you better believe Mom felt alone at nights with just us 2 little grade-school girls for company.  So she took up learning to play the guitar and would mangle chords to such classics as "Green Green Grass of Home" and "Take Me Home, Country Roads".  But oftentimes, my mom practiced her guitar playing diligently with Sammi Smith's "Help Me Make It Through The Night". Over and over and over. Although it drove my little 8-yr-old mind crazy having to endure my mom's tortured rendition of "Help Me Make It...", in retrospect, this song was how my mom was feeling so it's little wonder she loved this song so much. And now as an older and wiser music lover, this song really ain't that bad 
 Back in the 70's there was a guy named Joe Perry and a guy named Steven Tyler that eventually formed one of America's greatest rock n' roll bands to date. The most interesting thing to note is how the toxic twins originally met in Sunapee, New Jersey because Tyler wanted to comment to Perry on how good his fries were. This was the first interaction that inevitably formed Aerosmith. Walk This Way is an autobiographical history of the band from Boston including some of the craziest rock n' roll stories you've never heard. The book begins with the tale of the rehab in the 80's that was required to get Aerosmith back to the top of the music world. Tyler, who claims his bitterness to this day, was held an intervention by band members and managers, some of which were in just as bad a shape as he was. The book then goes back to childhood showing early musical influences of Tyler as well as early bands of all members including Chain Reaction and the Jam Band featuring Joe Perry and Tom Hamilton. Several issues follow through their entire career, including yoko-like girlfriends, greedy managers, and harder drugs. They also chronicle early reviews of the band, and lack of support from record labels. The band wasn't taken seriously, only being considered a Rolling Stones rip-off. The label would spend only $1 on Aerosmith for every $100 they spent on Bruce Springsteen. This is a must read for any Aerosmith fan or anyone who wants to be enthralled in tales of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. 
 I ordered the movie for a school project and they arrived in perfect condition with just enough time for me to do a movie psychology review on it. I got an A, so it was worth it 
 Series of Unfortunate Events Book #5 The Austere Academy   The book "Series of Unfortunate Events Book #5 The Austere Academy" by Lemony Snicket was about 3 orphans Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. The orphans had just come from another vague ancestor and another encounter with the evil count Olaf trying to steal the enormous fortune their parents had left behind when they perished in a horrible fire. Mr. Poe the banker that manages the orphan's money until violet comes of age (18 years old); decided to send the orphans to a boarding school away from count Olaf. The orphans cannot stay in the dorm rooms at the boarding school because they need parent permission, so they live in an old rundown shack with crabs all over the floor. That afternoon at lunch they met another pair of orphans who were us like them and became friends. Later one night before dinner they received a note from count Olaf telling them to meet him on the front lawn. The gym teacher obviously disguised as count Olaf told them to run laps he made them run 9 straight nights until they were flunking their classes. They were going to be expelled if they didn't pass the test. That night the kids came up with a plan. The quagmires would run while the orphans studied for their tests. They got quizzed the next morning as Mr. Poe came to check up on them; they convinced Mr. Poe that the gym teacher was count Olaf he ran away taking the quagmires with him. The book was very exiting to read, there was always action going on between Count Olaf and the orphans. That made the book very interesting and kept me reading. The book was very descriptive and made me feel like I was right in the middle of all the action. The conflict of the story is great. Not only is their one main conflict like escaping from count Olaf but there are also a lot of side conflicts. The characters were very well described it felt like I could almost picture them so perfectly I could touch them. The books' ending was a very good one but it was a bit sad when the quagmires got taken away. Overall I thought it was very descriptive and I liked it a lot! The author's voice is different from most authors. When he says a big word he always gives an example to help you understand, he also writes a little bit scary but with lots of action. The author's vocabulary is very different than those of others. He uses descriptive and understandable vocabulary, and like I said he always defines the big words. Some unique characteristics of his writing are, he never ever uses any boring words or says any word too many times. He also uses a lot of dialogue and it does help the story a lot with the conversations between characters. His tone is always vivid; you can almost never tell his feelings as he writes but the characters feelings are well described. I would rate this book very high especially about his descriptiveness, the story is very good and the mood is one you will enjoy. It can be read by kids or adults of any age and I am sure you will like it. I think this book is a book for any type of reader that enjoys a good book. I really liked it! Of course I've said that a million times but I mean what I say and you will really enjoy this book. It has everything in it from humor to sadness from sports to music. This is the right book for you to read!  
 I have taught this book in a Christian-oriented Business Ethics college course aimed at working adult students.  This is a very professional work. There is an excellent selection of case studies, many of them of fairly recent vintage. There are great discussions of theoretical concepts including models of social involvement (from the likes of Friedman, Goodpaster, and Rivoli) and "groupthink."  The book falls short in the otherwise promising subtitle: A Judeo-Christian Approach to Business Ethics. Rae and Wong present a variety of different ethical approachs and find merit in nearly all of them. For instance, ethical egoism is found to be consistent with a Christian world view because, after all, each of us must be concerned with the future of our own soul. What we seem to get is a generally eclectic view of ethics. In the end, the authors give the greatest weight to virtue ethics. However, it is highly debateable whether this view properly characterizes the "Judeo-Christian approach." While concern for one's soul, virtues, etc., certainly are part of the Christian life, many Christian ethicists might characterize the overall approach in terms of a modified divine command theory. In any case, after laying out all these approaches, and picking their favorite, the authors fail to apply virtue ethics with any regularity to their subsequent commentaries and discussions.  In my class, students much preferred the other textbook we used: Richard C. Chewning, et al's "Business Through the Eyes of Faith." This is a very different kind of book from "Beyond Integrity," but it seemed to speak directly to the students' personal situations. We might have been better off using a standard secular text on ethics, together with Chewning et al. However, "Beyond Integrity" is the book to use if you must have a top-flight business text with a Christian point of view.  Few doubt that we need to raise the level of honesty and integrity in the workplace. Given that most Americans proclaim a belief in God, and at least pay lip service to the Bible and Christianity, it makes sense that we should be calling on our employers and employees to "walk the talk." Arguably, a properly practiced Judeo-Christian ethic can provide the resources to build a better business environment 
 "The Other Kingdom" is a refreshing reminder of the days before world-class sport became a cold, professional exercise in earning money. It is unashamedly elitist, socially and intellectually as well as in terms of athletics, in a way that unmistakeably dates it. The protagonist's life, overshadowed by the reputation of a world-famous father, strikes an uneasy balance between his running, his girl friend, and his study of the German Sturm und Drang poets with their quest for heroism. At first glance, some of the athletics background looks to have been copied from real life - until you realize that this book was published in 1964, about the time of the Tokyo Olympics. So the runner who misses an Olympic medal by sprinting too soon, but later gets a European title, is not Michel Jazy: that didn't happen till 1966! Another amusing touch is the cover picture, which shows the young Herb Elliott. (If you're going to borrow from real life, why not borrow the best?)   Courtesy of Amazon, you can read the first few pages here. Note how skilfully the author introduces all the main characters while describing a training run. This is easily the best account I have ever read of how it feels to run far faster than you ever thought possible. Something similar happened to Jim Ryun when he "unintentionally" broke the world record for the half-mile while competing in a collegiate event in 1966, leaving world-class rivals far behind without any particular effort. Ryun took nearly five seconds off his personal best that day, and soon after broke the world record for the mile.  Bottom line: it's not a pure running story, by a long chalk. Instead, it shows convincingly how world-class sporting achievement must be rooted in a person's whole life 
 This book was first released in the early 80s under one of Koontz' pseudonyms. Susan wakes up in the hospital after a car accident. At first she can't remember anything about herself but her memory gradually returns. In the hospital, she starts to see what appears to be the ghosts of four fraternity boys who killed her boyfriend thirteen years ago. Are they really ghosts, or is she losing her sanity?  The premise is a good one and it keeps you interested. But the buildup is a bit too long compared to the ending. She encounters her tormentors several times, but it never feels like there's any imminent threat to her until the last half of the book. About 100 pages before the ending, the story really takes off and it's a great read until the somewhat too abrupt ending.   Not one of Koontz' best, but still definately an entertaining read. A weak 4 stars. 
 "Becoming Mae West" is simply the best book written about the star because it is focused and meticulously researched, employing primary  sources when available.  Ms Leider's book has the authority without  sacrificing readability; the author writes well.  The fascinating part of  West's life is how she cobbled together an act and a personality that is an  amalgam of Police Gazette melodrama, the comic camp of female impressionist  Bert Savoy, and the daring sexual style and musical sense of the great  African American blues women.  Mae West's sense of possibilities allowed  her to transform herself from a pudgy Jewish/Irish girl with more guts than  talent into a blond sex symbol of amazonian proportions (okay, she used six  inch platform shoes) who refined the rough soubrette type into a witty  American icon. Emily Leider tells this story well.  For those who wanted  the dirt on West's declining decades, Ms. Leider sketches it in to complete  the tale.  But as Leider warns the reader, it was the act of Becoming Mae  West that prompted her to write this book, not the effort of a woman  entrapped by her creation to preserve it. Highly recommended 
 The last reviewer's interpretation of the book involves a narrow understanding of profit motive as "greed" and no understanding of property rights.  (The same is a problem for the environmental movement today.) ... Someone truly driven by profit (Once-ler) motive would not cut down all of his Truffula trees, but rather would replant and manage his truffula forests in order to continue his biggering (growth) into the future.  At the same time, habitat for the forest creatures is continuously renewed (dispelling this apparent dichotomy).  In the Lorax, there are no clearly assigned property rights.  Thus, the Once-ler's has no incentive to protect his own property.  Indeed, since no one owns the surrounding property either, the Once-ler is also allowed to pollute, as well.  They have no recourse to sue him or exact compensation, so the Once-ler is allowed to spread the cost of his activities onto everyone else.  This is known by economists and social theorists as the Tragedy of the Commons...  The lesson I'll teach my kids from this book is respect for other's property, for nature, and that "common property" ends in disaster 
 Stark, depressing, moving, quiet, sad, redemptive, and superb.  All of these adjectives describe what many believe to be the primary Willie Nelson masterpiece, 1975's Red Headed Stranger.  This classic was smartly reissued in 2000 with some great bonus tracks and much-improved sound.  A necessity in anyone's music collection 
 I made the cake on the cover of the book and was pleased with the outcome.  I have dabbled in sugarpaste before so this does help.  However, all of Debbie's books are clear and concise.  Highly recommended to anyone who is serious about making a unique cake, which requires patience and the will.  The book is worth the pictures alone 
 This is an excellent book for the young ones that are just starting to be inquisitive about their surroundings. It helps them learn the different animals while they can touch the book and laugh and giggle along with you 
 Since I just reviewed Photoshop CS Complete Course I thought that this book would flow from the basics to the more advanced features in CS, and hopefully give more insight into some of the new tools in Photoshop CS. This book is broken down into six major parts with nine chapters covering: Image Color, Altering Image Objects, Creating Objects, Photo-realism and Illustration. The book also comes with a tutorial CD in the back that corresponds to the different chapters plus is has a bonus selection.  Part one; chapters 1&2: Covers tone, color correction and separation. You get more in depth knowledge of curves, using channels and correcting specific colors. This may explain why some of your images may not output to your printer in comparison to what you see on the screen. Lesson learned make sure to calibrate your monitor. Chapter two covers color separations. You learn how to adjust each color separately. Being able to adjust each color separately gives you the control over taking your image from flat to it's full dynamic color range. You also learn how to create duo-tones, and how to separate CMYK color both manually and the automated way.  Part two; chapters 3&4: Covers altering image objects. The cloning tool & I have been friends forever. It's one of the tools that I use extensively with many of my photos with live models to cover blemishes and other unsightly marks on the face and hands area. Ch 3 covers the use of the cloning tool, healing brush and the patch tool. While using masks can be a bit frustrating, using a mask does help with some very time consuming modifications you might need to make to an image. This tweaking can make an otherwise flat image or over saturated image much closer to what you visualized. Ch four covers correction filters. We've all had noise in our images, noise is akin to grain in film sometimes a little bit is acceptable and other times it can really sink an image. In this chapter you learn how to smooth out color noise and tone.  Part three; chapters 5&6: Covers shaping objects, vectors and illustrations. Ch five deals with shaping objects, like buttons for a website, it shows how light and shadows give these objects depth. I really loved creating the seamless textures and tiling backgrounds segment. In my photography business it's "Senior" time and making my own customized graffiti wall is proving to be a neat choice for some of my clients. I am going to spend more time playing with the jigsaw puzzle component. Making an object from scratch shows why graphic artists get so much money. It's a very time consuming endeavor and you realize that those already designed graphics have a lot involved. Ch six covers vectors and illustrations. I have used Illustrator in the past and I really liked being able to make something small and then blow it up to the size of my desk and not lose any of the quality. You get a practical approach to building your own object, it might make some people want to start using Illustrator. This chapter also covers converting pixel images to vectors.  Part four; chapters 7&8: Deals with image output options and creating images for the web with Photoshop and ImageReady. Ch seven covers printing for at home and a printing service. Of course at home you could just reprint if it doesn't look right, with a printing service you need to have all of your settings done prior or your results may not match what you have in mind. There is usually more coordination between the user and printer to get all of the information and formatting. Not all printers are created the same: Laser, ink-jet and dye sub all have very different looks and feel to them. Make sure you know how your paper and the printing process you choose will interact with each other. Ch eight covers ImageReady. I haven't really used this program yet. However since it can create animated effects that will probably be the next program I start looking for more info on. You start using actions with this chapter. You learn how to make a complex and simple animation.  Part five; chapter 9: Deals with creating, editing and using actions. Let me tell you from a person that has had to resize and put my logo on thousands of images this is a feature that I will be the mistress of shortly. I do use the automate feature to have my images resized for my website, but I still am manually putting my logo across the front of my images using PaintShop Pro. So I'm looking forward to being able to tell Photoshop have at it. This is a very underused and discussed feature of Photoshop I feel. Some of us do lots of repetitive tasks in Photoshop and this baby needs to start earning it's keep more.  I do have a confession to make about this book. I am a reader and manual person, give me a book and I'm a happy camper. This book gave me a headache at times, I had to back track on some of the step-by-step instructions because they left something out or told you to turn something on or off later on during the steps. The book is in black & white except for the middle pages. Now I don't need color photos to make me happy but it certainly lets you know right off the bat if you are on the right track or not.  While the book has lots of knowledge it was at times confusing. You can't really skip around in this book many of the chapters make mention of some step you made in another chapter then you have to hunt for it and try to figure out how it fits into your current chapter. I had to put the book down and pick it back up after my brain had some time to process what it was I just read. Lot of information but you have to put aside some serious time if you want to master these secrets 
 This quick read (167 pages in the large print edition) reveals the life changing experience for Kirk Douglas when he survived a stroke at age 80.  The veteran actor struggled to regain his speech and suffered the overwhelming depression that accompanies stroke. You get glimpses of his childhood interspersed with flashbacks to his movie and personal experiences with the screen's great stars. Although spared the swallowing difficulties and paralysis that make a stroke so debilitating, the loss of speech affected his self-worth.  Speech is crucial to an actor, so Douglas had to relearn that ability through therapy.  His triumphs along the road to recovery include acting in two films in his 80s and giving a speech when receiving an oscar for lifetime achievement in films. His stroke taught him "to be more compassionate, to work harder at my relationships with my loved ones, to value friendship more, to be aware of the world around me, to slow down and to have a richer spiritual life." Maybe readers can learn these life lessons without having their own "stroke of luck. 
 I love these DVD'S. The color and clarity is great. The stories are so wonderful. They make me feel like i've stepped back in time to my childhood when things were a lot simpler and safer. We have a cabin in the Mts. and we try to go every weekend and these DVD's go with us every weekend. I have all 4 seasons. Can't wait for the next one to come out 
 Undoubtedly it's a bible for pianists, as well as a must have for all classical music fans, even whom can not read staves well. 
 Excellent review of the issues whether or not one agrees 100%. It is unfortunate that the reviews are all positive because it means those who SHOULD read it wallow in books and opinions that support their own biases. No right wing or JDL reviewers here. No pompous Bennett or bigot Pipes. Should be assigned to all members of Congress (with a quiz) before they debate Iraq too. (But now freshmen get sessions with Rush Limbaugh rather than Harvard's school of government that better reflects the intellectual standards of the Right and of Bush.) The mainstream Press, and members of Congress fear truth - or even different opinion - unless subsidized by voting blocks and paid for by the beneficiaries of Bush tax reform. ('Making the world safe for Billionaires' is the order of the day, not truth, justice, or democracy - not even civil rights. 
 It's only a $15 necklace, so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. The chain is kind of flimsy, but I have other silver chains and I just put it in one of those.  Very cute for a semi-casual night out, lots of people complimented it 
 I'm a great Scooby-Fan from Germany. Although Scooby isn't so popular in our country like in the USA you can watch all series on German Television. Season 1&2 were released in Germany two years after the release in the USA... so, i bought the US-DVD-Pack and I LOVED IT! So... it was a fantastic feeling to get Season 3 now, because most of these 3rd season I never have seen before! AND I LOVE IT AGAIN!  Greets from Germany 
 "Memoirs" is an exquisite look at the life of Japanese geishas, particularly during the period just prior to and during World War II. I love both historical novels and intimate looks at foreign cultures, and Golden's first novel fit both bills.  The development of a very complex lead character and the intrigue of the competitive world of geishas are bonuses, as are glimpses at the world of sumo, and at the deprivations caused by Japan's entry into World War II.  Very highly recommended 
 Most people who have read any Manuel Puig, are familiar with his Kiss of a Spiderwoman, which the film and the Tony winning musical are based on.  Also included in this book are two other plays.  Under a Mantel of Stars is  an outrageous sexual farce.  Mystery of the Rose Bouquet is the real treat  of the bunch.  The play is about two elderly women, a nurse and her  patient.  It shows what Puig did best- write women.  His female characters  are some of the strongest and most interesting that I have ever read.  All  of the plays have relatively small casts and should be relatively  inexpensive to produce 
 Yup you know the story, I don't need to reiterate it.  Fantastic make out scenes.  Great 80's themed punk bad boys - you know the ones that are so ambiguous that they're cute and tough but would never be considered tough now-a-days. . . .Maybe not even tough back then either!  All the stereotypical 80's stuff in here!  Hot cars, colored hair, one earring in one ear, big clothes, off the shoulder wear, great special effects that even today make you wonder in awe.  TOTALLY frames up the cool 80's the way it should be.  Wish it was like that today 
 The book was terrific - it made me think about the non-financial aspects of retirement and opened a view of what exciting things will lie ahead if I will come out of the box of my routine life!  It helped me see that there is more to life than cashing the next paycheck!  I have given this as gifts and recommended it to many - one person told me that he got it for Christmas and just a little ways into the book decided to retire within the year - mandatory reading 
 Though his first "rock" album, and the one that stirred such controversy was the excellent Bringing it All Back Home, Dylan's greatest rock masterpieces are Highway 61 Revisited and the following Blonde on Blonde. This is not rock in the traditional sense so much as it's rock b/c of its attitude, feel, and level of noise. The lyrical style is different from that of his folk albums, but equally brilliant, and among the best in the universe. The musicianship is stellar and the songs even better. Simply put, Dylan didn't just record a rock album, he recorded one of the finest ever created. "Like a Rolling Stone" is considered by several to be the greatest single ever released, and is certainly one of the 10 best, and thus it is the song that may attract many non-Dylan fans to the album, but truly not one second of any track is wasted. The sharp wit, scathing commentary and voice, wailing guitars, and raucous rhythm section are purely sublime. This album was so far ahead of its time, that the times haven't caught up to it yet. This is one of the albums that showed that rock could be art, not just noise.  Some favorites, though it's hard not to mention all the tracks, are the bluesy and high-energy "Tombstone Blues," the dark, yet also darkly funny, "Ballad of a Thin Man," the mythical"Highway 61" and the last two tracks which rank among Dylan's very best offerings, "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues," and the breathtaking epic closing track "Desolation Row." Anyone that isn't typically into Dylan should give this album a shot, and anyone that likes him and doesn't have it, needs it. Even folk purists should be hard pressed to find fault with Dylan for creating art of such high quality 
 This is the best book about incest, surviving, truth, honesty, and healing that i have EVER picked up and read. I read it all in 3 days, and then proceeded to read it again another 3 times. There are certain chapters that I read and skip the rest. She is strong on her views, but more so, strong in herself. It is my hope that everyone will have a copy of this book on their shelf in time. It is a must read book even if you are not a survivor. It will teach you warning signs, how to talk to other survivors, how to talk with children. This book was carefully and honestly written. I wish there were a hundered more out there like this 
 Dyer's theme for this book is self awareness and how to produce miracles with the power of thought. We ourselves are miracles. He reminds us of who we are and covers every aspect of life that affects us including the discovery of our purpose in being here. Dyer has a magic way of awakening the spirit.

 I used the first edition of Stroustrip's The C++ Programming Language until it was dog-eared and the binding fell apart.  I'm glad that this edition is hard-backed so I won't wear it out.  C++ is a complex language and it's impossible to write a program of any size in C++ without a good reference on your desk.  I have not found any other C++ reference that is as complete or as useful as this book.  This is not an introduction to C++ but rather a reference book.  I learned C++ from Lippman's C++ Primer but that's on my bookshelf and Stroustrip is on my desk.  
 `In America' is a truly touching and beautiful film, elevated by strong performances by everyone involved.  The film centers on a poor Irish family that, after the tragic death of their 5-year-old son, illegally move to New York's Hells Kitchen and try and start a new.  The family consists of parents Johnny and Sarah (Paddy Considine & Samantha Morton) as well as their two daughters Christy and Ariel (Sarah & Emma Bolger).  Johnny is trying to make it in the world of acting, and they struggle as he fails audition after audition.  Their apartment is just about condemned, all their neighbors are crack addicts, and worse yet Sarah has become pregnant again and her condition is far from perfect.  In the midst of all this tragedy there is a glimmer of light.  That light is found in Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who, while appearing to be reclusive and mean actually lets his guard down with this family and becomes a friend.  It all starts with his kind gesture towards the two girls while the experience their first Halloween in the states.  No one is paying them any mind as they trick or treat throughout the building, but Mateo is softened and opens the door for a friendship all parties needed.  As the film progresses and we learn of Mateo's condition, their relationships become more and more pertinent and meaning some.  They need each other.  The final frames of the film are tragic yet beautiful and as the oldest daughter Christy turns off her camera a tear is brought to your eyes...one of happiness mixed with sorrow.  This is a brilliant film that touches on so many levels of human emotion, from grief to acceptance to fear and happiness.  As you watch these people grow and learn you are swallowed up in their trials as if you've known them your whole life.  This is due mostly to the impressive cast.  Samantha Morton hands down delivers the finest performance here.  I only feel that if the academy had placed her in the right category (she was above all things `Supporting') she may have beat out Renee for the golden statuette.  Regardless, her performance was harrowing.  She captured every emotion a grieving mother goes through, and her nervous breakdown in the hospital is so emotionally gripping it had me weeping.  Djimon Hounsou blew me away with very little words, but it was Paddy that shocked me, mostly because he was all but ignored come awards season.  He was brilliant and deserved some recognition.  His grieving father trying to hold his family together in the midst of even more tragedy was heart stopping.  And don't forget these two young girls who played their roles so perfectly you'd swear they weren't acting.  They became these adorable innocent children without slipping into stereotypical `cute kids', remaining three dimensional and `real', not Hollywoodized and hollow!   This film is, as many have stated, classic and should be watched and enjoyed by everyone.  It's very rare you get to enjoy something that exuberates perfection on every level, and this film, this rarity, does just that. 
 What can I say? bell hooks does it again and if the issue of black love is holding you back from buying this book please reconsider. This book speaks to everyone 
 If you are looking for an explanation of what Christians believe stated in  language that anyone can understand, and clearly supported by biblical  texts, then this is very likely the book you are looking for.  Little  writes especially for college students who are seeking to understand the  Christian faith; not for professional theologians.  His goal is to explain  what is central to Christian teaching, that which unites all Christians,  not that which divides Christians into different confessions.  His gift is  clarity and precision.  I have used this book ever since it came out over  twenty five years ago in teaching basic Christian doctrine in both a local  church and college class setting.  It is still my preference as an  initiation to Christian Doctrine 
 I don't have the DVD for the movie Bingo and I have never watched the movie on DVD but only on video tape and I thought this was a cute movie. I know that the professional critics didn't like this movie and a lot of people put it down because they think it's too cutesy but when I watched the movie Bingo I enjoyed it it and I liked the cast especially Cindy Williams from the TV show Laverne and Shirley and David Rasche from the TV show Sledge Hammer and I recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about dogs. In my opinion this movie is cute but it's not too cutesy! It is about a cute dog named Bingo who runs away from his cruel original owner and is found by a little boy who hides him in his house because his father who is a professional football player is allergic to dogs. [...] I would hate to buy the DVD if it's a pan and scan edit of a widescreen movie 
 ... and HERE is the prime reason why Europe does not understand the USA, and also why Democrats have gone from being Americans that lean left to Europeans that sometimes lean American!  "The Right Nation" shows that we are, indeed, a religious nation, both Democrat and Republican. They do a fantastic job explaining American conservatism and why it differs from European conservatism. This point cannot be discussed enough, really.  European conservatives are hidebound and rooted completely in Monarchic pasts, but American conservatism is and always has been a progressive conservatism. And now, the European right is becoming reactionary and racist which is just a reflection of a racism that has never been defeated in Europe as it has in the US.  This book is a must, even for Democrats, if you want to understand the reason Europe doesn't  "get" the USA and why we Americans should be wary of becoming too much like Europe. Becoming more like Europe would be an abrogation of everything that has been and should be truly American in nature.  Get this book! 
    Harvey is a totally spoiled boy. It starts when Harvey is on a ship with his Mother (I forget where they are going) he is washed overboard, and saved by a fisherman `Manuel.' On the fishing boat Harvey makes his first friend, learns to work for his keep and so on. The story worked, it wasn't cheesy, maybe because it was one of the first novels of that type, but the plot of Harvey "growing up" seemed just to be there so you will read the book. The characters were well developed except the cook, you never really figure out where he is coming from. Most of the book was about fishing of The Grand Banks, very interesting is you like fishing and ships, but if you are reading it for the story, there is not that much, the ending was also weak, we are happy the Harvey is reconciled, but I really think that his parents would make a bigger stink. Good historical value, Kipling is a very enjoyable writer, yes I liked it but the plot had some flaws. I do recommend it though. 
 I have had 2 Epson and 3 HP scanners in the past.  This is by far the best.  I had a lot of old photos from early 1900's to computerize.  It did great.  It also did great with the slides and negatives.  I highly recommend this. I can't wait to get started on the family documents.  If they convert as easily as the photos, I will be extremely pleased.  So the question is "Why did HP discontinue making something that works so well 
 Napier's self-reflections as well as his piecing together a fascinating case study makes this book an inspiring, if a little dated, read for those considering or heading into family and marriage therapy.  
 This book is a good example of what a textbook should be like.  It explains the topic of bank management with competence, pointing out all the major issues without going too deep (and boring the beginner).  After reading the first few chapters, the interested reader feels knowledgeable enough to intelligently discuss the topic.    The book is well segmented, with an initial explanation of bank financial statements and the main risks and opportunities associated with bank management.  These chapters empower the beginner with confidence of understanding exactly how a bank makes money.  Bank management seems like a very complex topic, something outside the reach of normal people; it is not true, anyone with a decent volume of training could perform the basic management activities of a bank.  I highly recommend this book for anyone working at a bank in order to understand the business, its risks and the main drivers of performance.  If you are considering bank entrepreneurship, this is a must.  There is a chapter that demonstrates the initial processes of bank management in a very simple way, which is interesting and encouraging to someone following down that pathway 
 I'm not a mystery/thriller reader and so bought this book only because its author is Banville. So to an extreme outsider it seems that Banville has taken almost every pulp cliché and turned it inside out, doubling up at every opportunity (Mal works with the living / Quirk with the dead. They are married to sisters: Mal's wife is alive / Quirk's dead -- thus they are brothers-in-law and because they share a parent, brothers by law. Father to Mal, adoptive father, or better still, Judge to Quirk. Mal orders an omelet, Quirk, the bird, and so on to deliriously detailed levels of interplay...and later still remarkably persisent stretches of alliteration) that make this something of a entertainingly postmodern excursion in Fun with Form wrapped within a dark to darker noir setting. All this is done without ever abandoning the fundamental obligation of delivering a well-told tale. Time, place, character, plot and the hazy details that shape up lives and deaths are all convincing in their familiarity, but the surface texture isn't all that matters here. As is usual for Banville, the language is exceptionally rich and lyrical, with some allusions proving profoundly unnerving, others profoundly amusing and still others so tenuously connected to their subject that you'll stop and think and think again. And importantly -- unlike another work by a "serious" writer pursuing a theoretically less demanding form -- "Christine Falls" never strains under the weight of all this talent in the way that Martin Amis' "Night Train" sadly came to a creaking halt, mid-rail. Bottom line, this one is as engrossing to read as it must have been to write 
 This is my first multi-function printer.  I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much from the scanner or copier.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised!  The scanner scans in very nicely - and the biggest bonus is that it scans in color!  The copier produces good quality copies as well.  Both the scanner and copier are not very quick - but that is okay, because I don't make very many copies or scans in the first place.  And of course - the most important part - the printer is excellent laser quality.  The only two downsides of the printer are:  (1) it does not print duplex, and (2) it does not print color.  Of course - the laser color option would've probably tripled the cost - but it would've been nice.  All in all, I think this is a great printer for anyone looking for a good quality B&W laser printer, color scanner, and B&W copier 
 Jim Kilby was one of my professors when I attended UNLV.  His extensive knowledge and experience in the gaming industry makes him one of the best resources for anyone in the gaming business.  This book will provide you with a solid foundation in gaming.  A must have for anyone in the business 
 Simply Awesome! I keep having to stop the tape so it can sink in 
 This is music that sounds better every day.  Mysterious, elemental, intellectual 
 My grandmother gave me this book years ago as a birthday present, and my copy shows definite signs have having been read and reread many times over.  I never grow tired of reading it, and it makes me feel good every time I open it up.  I'll accept what other reviewers of Cherokee descent have stated here that this is not an accurate depiction of their way of life.  Here's the kicker though...I did not read this book to learn about the Cherokee, so the fact that it is not a true portrayal is not a concern to me.  The family could just as easily have been German, Chinese, Russian, or Arab, it wouldn't have made any difference.    I'll also accept that Forrest (Asa) Carter was a racist, segregationist, KKK member.  Mr. Carter is gone, and I don't know, nor will anyone else ever know, what his true motivation behind writing this story was.  What is more important is the overall message that this book portrays, and it is NOT one of racism.  It is an endearing account of a little boy's relationship with his grandparents and their lives together in the mountains during the Depression.  The wonderful thing is that it is told from the viewpoint of a 5 year old.  He is too young to understand much about the adult world around him, and it is interesting to see his interpretations of the various things he experiences.  He has a child's innocence, and is still able to view even the simplest things with wonder and can derive enjoyment from them.  Five year olds today need an explosive video game to be so entertained.  The characters are well developed, a bit oversimplified, but intensly human.  The writing is incredibly descriptive, and provides the reader with a vivid mental picture of what is happening.  It teaches the pleasure of slowing down and paying attention to the little things that are happening in the world, like watching a spider trying to build its web across a creek.  It demonstrates the comfort and closeness derived when being separated from loved ones by looking at the same star or lighting a candle at the same time.  As for stereotypes, I didn't find it here.  Some people have stated that the fact that Little Tree and his grandparents are uneducated reflects a negative Native American stereotype.  I don't believe this to be the case in this book.  They are uneducated, yes; but in that place and time in history, so were many people, of many races.    Overall, this is a rich story about the strength of love and family, hardships and overcoming them, and slowing down and finding wonder wherever you can.  About looking at the world through the innocent eyes of a child.  If you are looking for a fast paced action thriller, do not read this book.  If you are looking to read a book that is a true and accurate portrayal of Native American life, this is not the book for you.  But if you are looking for a nice, feel-good story, then don't pass this book up!  For those who are bent on picking apart and finding fault in this book, well I suppose one could find fault in anything if you look hard enough for it.  There are some people who just spend their lives looking for the worst in everything, and as a result, miss out on life's simple pleasures, one of which is this book.    
 This book is truly one of the most interesting and purely entertaining books I've ever read.  The creepy imagery of the sleepwalking man digging in the street and then the caves and indians will stick with me forever.  What an amazingly creative man.  An x-files-esque dreamer living in the 1790s 
 This is a fantastic book, full of wonderful poetry and Eric Carle's trademark collage art. This book includes poetry selections that span the cultures, including Native American, aboriginal, and Japanese to name a few. Many of the big names in poetry are here, from Shakespeare to Ogden Nash. I especially liked the reference to creation included with a quote from Genesis and a picture of a whale. My personal favorite poem in the book is "Mother Doesn't Want a Dog," and why "She's making a mistake." This is a great introduction to poetry for children that the whole family loves. Truly a great addition to my homeschool library 
 I loved listening to this book! I learned a lot of things about our leaders that I didn't know before.  I especially appreciated the jokes. Very funny. 
 this book sucks very badly! as soon as i was on the second page i threw it in the fire place!! 
 This is one of those classic books, that never get old. I grew up watching the movie, and did not read the book until I was 17. I thought, oh, this is not going to be nearly as good. Quite the opposite! This was such an enriching, lovely drama. Tragic, sure. Yet, there is hope, love, and all things enternal to human lives and love.   Read this book if you are a huge fan of the movie. Its better than the movie in so many ways. You learn more about Mary Carson, you see more of Fee's true character (and her family!!), and why Frank and Paddy are the way they are. Of course, you see in full play Meggie & Father Ralph as they grow up together, and fight the other through love, time, & religion.   So worth your time! I read it at least once a year!!! : 
 one problem though - only four songs! these four songs though... wow. millions of stars i give this ep. 4 or 5 years ago, this material was my introduction to music that heavily incorporates screaming vocals. words cannot begin to do this release any justice. the lyrics are extremely well written and thought out (it's defititely cool to read them while listening to the songs). the music is packed with so much energy that you just feel like jumping around. i cannot think of one aspect to complain about - it's that great. this ep is way up on the list of best musical pieces i have purchased or listened to (and i have a collection of well over 200 music cds, plus an awful lot of albums on other formats). maybe not for the technicality, but for the overall sound the guitars are in my opinion some of the best guitar compositions i have heard (greats like hendrix/fripp/clapton destroy them of course, but for modern music i think they're extremely impressive). drums sound good too, never resorting to typical beats (the drummer is by no means a danny carey, but still keeps the listener interested). music goes from point a to point b and never back to point a, which i love. for those that don't like screaming, try to listen to this and try to accept it for what it is - if you are not narrow minded you will realize the complexity and beauty in the songs and will perhaps even enjoy them. for those that don't like it, return to your mtv 
 This book is full of engaging insights, and the amount of vitriol it's inspired in it's critics is telling.  Roiphie's point of sustained  victim-hood is well taken, and is one of the major forces inhibiting  feminism from reaching it's goals.  A must read for those who want to  incorporate the full spectrum of gender issues into their thinking 
 This is a wonderful book for those people to get to see the first seven months of Tai Shan's life as it was actually recorded on the National Zoo Panda Cam.  Tai Shan, whose name means "peaceful mountain" in Chinese is a must see attraction for people when they come to Washingto 
 I first heard John Mayer on The-N (a TV channel) when I was watching his Bigger Than My Body video. I loved the video and I loved the song. A few months after, for my birthday, I got this CD and went up to my room to listen to the whole thing over and over and over again. That's what I usually do, :D. My favorite song on this album is definitley No Such Thing. I can play the intro on my guitar and I've heard the song on Wisconsin's radio stations ALL THE TIME. I really like this CD better than Heavier Things, even though I love that album too. I feel good when I listen to the songs on this album and it makes me feel younger :D and the songs make me happy!!! 8/5 stars!!! Great album, one of my favorites. I recommend this album to any soft/alternative rock fans 
 One can know the numbers and even various details of the Black Death, but Connie Willis makes her reader feel it in personal, human terms. The book is a world (or two worlds, since it is half in the 21st century and half in the 14th) of its own which catches the reader so that you cannot let go until the last page. Willis breathes wonderful new life into the old SF trope, the time machine. Typical of Willis' stories, characters are constantly ensnared in a mass of little problems that make it almost impossible for them to deal with the big problems-- a crummy phone system, an absent administrator, fogged up glasses, etc. (today's readers will notice the notice the lack of cell phones, now ubiquitous in Britain as elsewhere, but not extant when Willis wrote the book). Willis' 14th century episodes have the virtues of the fine historical novel: meticulous accuracy in terms of what is known, plus vividly imagined characters and situations. 
 It seems all too easy to state that the individuals who could most benefit from reading this book are not very likely to read it. For the most part, those individuals would need to read a great deal more than this book, in fact, for many of these persons, the thesis here would be quickly oversimplified, misunderstood and dismissed as the 'foolishness' of the world. A large part of the scandal of the evangelical mind is that many evangelicals don't have a robust enough intellectual interest to actually understand Noll's discussions. The problem for American evangelical Christianity is its two century long embrace of anti-intellectualism and, complimentarily, its disinterest in, if not outright disdain for, Jesus' "most important" (Mark) and "greatest" (Matthew) commandment: that his follower must worship God with the full strength of his mind [intellect] (Mark 12:30, Matthew 22:37), as well as with his heart and soul. Noll finally points out indicators that, in at least some sectors of American evangelicalism, a renewed interest in vigorous intellectual life is stirring at long last. Where Christianity has broadly disregarded its potential contributions to the intellectual life of a culture, it has lost dynamism and influence in that culture. By contrast, "Where Christian faith is securely rooted, where it penetrates deeply into a culture to change individual lives and redirect institutions, where it continues for more than a generation as a living testimony to the grace of God -- in these situations, we almost invariably find Christians ardently cultivating the intellect for the glory of God" (p43).  The critique is generally not imbalanced, "To follow either intellectuals who criticize simple piety or advocates of Christian experience who attack the life of the mind leads to difficulty." In the USA, however, the cultural context after the American Revolution was that of "a culture that mounted a frontal assault upon tradition, mediating elites, and institutions, the Bible very easily became . . . 'a book dropped from the skies for all sorts of men to use in their own way'" (Nathan Hatch, p97). Those areas of American evangelical dogmatism that Noll examines as being anti-intellectual include: 'young-earth creationism' as built on a problematic demand that Genesis 1-2 be interpreted as scientific/historical rather than as a figurative theological framework (as many ancient exegetes understood it); several excessively anti-epistemic and fideistic views traced to the American Holiness movement; Darbyist (Pentecostal and especially Southern Baptist) eschatological innovations centered on a 'secret rapture' and the role of literal Israel in end-times events; and the wide ranging role of the political right, over the course of recent generations, in dictating the greater culture's perception of Christianity as being a certain set of political agendas. For the most part, I agreed with Noll's views and arguments, but they are not without some problems. One problem is his attempt to assign the literal interpretation of the creation account to Adventists E.G. White and G.M. Price. Here he follows the argument of R. Numbers, but, as with Numbers, it's an artificially selective line of argument.  J. Ussher and J. Lightfoot had famously demanded a literalist interpretation earlier, and it was an understanding that had long been embraced in many, although not all, Christian circles. Ussher's interpretation was published in the margins of the authorized English version of the Bible that was widely used in Britain and North America between 1700 and 1900  (which includes the first century of the period Noll is examining). Questions and disagreements regarding the correct understanding of the Genesis creation account have been argued, more or less, for more than 2000 years (see Philo), since the time of Jesus' ministry and earlier, and have always included both the literalist and non-literalist* views. Trying to establish nineteenth and twentieth century scapegoats in this regard is rather reckless scholarship, particularly for a book of this nature. I don't recall that Noll mentions Ussher or Lighfoot, he simply defers to Numbers selective arguments. * (Eastern and Roman Christianity have always been aware that many of the early 'fathers' and 'doctors' of the church in fact dissented from the literalist's interpretation of the creation account, instructing that the text is correctly examined for its emblematic theology and 'literary' structure, and not merely by defaulting to the approach of the Sadducees, i.e., plucking "letters" from surfaces. The reasons that Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Augustine of Hippo all supported a 'literary', instead of literal, exegesis are several, and look to scripture as the interpreter of scripture, rather than relying on common human expectations. Yet many, perhaps most [?] within the Protestant tradition have seemed completely ignorant of, if not disinterested in, some hermeneutics that are not of their own tradition. If your clergyman or Sunday School teacher is unaware of the ancient exegetical perceptions of Philo, Origen, or Augustine, that no longer means that you must be.)  All things considered, however, this book is an important exposition of a significant challenge to the Protestant Christian community as it has functioned in the United States for much of the past 200 years. This was something of a groundbreaking work when it was published in 1994, and the questions of how Christian thought should involve itself in areas of natural science, political and social sciences, education, and the arts, have been further engaged by several excellent volumes in more recent years. I recommend James Sires' Habits of the Mind: Intellectual Life as a Christian Calling. wes janssen 200 
 Most of what little we know of Saudi Arabia comes from little snippets we get on TV or in the popular press. Here at last, is a current, well-written story of Saudi Arabia told by a western journalist who actually lived there.   I believe that he is right wneh he said this is a kingdom in crisis. While Osama bin Laden clearly has America in his sights as an enemy, he apparently considers it his devine duty to take over Saudi Arabia. Combine this with a huge number of non-Saudi workers, with internal conflict combine from groups excluded from the power structure and you get a country with gret potential for trouble.   Mr. Bradley presents a view of Saudi Arabia from the inside. It's a story of a few at the top holding down a much larger population. This is a situation seen in many times, in many blaces before. Some of these have lasted for a very long time, but others have fallen apart.   The one point I would have liked to have seen explored in more detail is the nature of the oil situation. I ralize that this is not his area of expertise, but some understanding of the Saudi's oil situation as seen from inside the country would be nice to know 
 I came to Bryan Ward-Perkins' work indirectly, through reading Rodney Stark's "The Victory of Reason." Stark argues the reason for the superiority of Western culture is the Christian religion, especially the Catholic Christian religion with its emphasis on the (alleged) rationality of God and on the goodness of creation.   Stark's Christian triumphalism requires him to attack  the classic account of the "Decline and Fall" of Western Roman Civilization by Edward Gibbion. Gibbon argued (in 1776) that the "useless" activities of the monasteries and churches in the 5th Century required so much labor and wealth that little was left over to fend off the barbarians. The fall of Rome, Gibbon concluded,  "was a triumph of barbarism and religion." (Amazon sells a nice little summary of Gibbon's views entitled "Christians and the Fall of Rome.")  Stark dissents from Gibbon's view, arguing that there had been no "fall" of civilization in the 5th Century. There had simply been a cultural segue from one type of social organization (Roman) to another (feudal society featuring monasteries and local castles).   I had never heard anyone seriously deny there had been a "fall" of Roman civilization in the 5th Century, and I did not know enough at that time to contest his ideas. Then while in a waiting room, I came across an article by Ward-Perkins in the magazine "History Today" (as I recall its title). Ward-Perkins briefly laid out the issue between the defenders of the "discontinuity thesis" (like Gibbon) and the defenders of the "continuity thesis" (which included historians like the Oxford historian Peter Brown and of course Rodney Stark).  Bryan Ward-Perkin's book, "The Fall of Rome," is a compact and easily understood exposition of this issue, along with some very solid archaeological evidence that the classical "discontinuity" thesis of Eduard Gibbon is much more nearly correct than is the continuity thesis of historians like Stark and Peter Brown.  Ward-Perkins pokes gentle fun at the continuity theorists. He writes (p. 82) that "recent literature on the Germanic settlements reads like ... a tea party at the Roman vicarage. A shy newcomer to the village, who is a useful prospect for the cricket team, is invited in. There is a brief moment of awkwardness, while the host finds an empty chaor and pours a fresh cup of tea; but the conversation, and the village life, soon flows on."  Ward-Perkins has engaged in archeological excavations in Roman sites (near Pisa in Italy), where he has been able to trace the material bases of life (such as pottery and home construction) from the 4th to the 6th Centuries. There is plainly a collapse in the quality of life available to those living there during the time of the Germanic invasions. These barbarian invasions were no tea party.  There was a recovery beginning in the 6th Century, after the Germanic and Roman populations had fused into new people called "the Franks". But the quality of life available for ordinary persons did not equal that of the citizens of the late Roman Empire until the 17th Century. There really was a "fall" from the status of civilized existence in 5th Century Italy. And contrary to Stark, one can still build a substantial case that Christianity was one of the contributing causes.  I wish all historians were as easy to read and understand as is Bryan Ward-Perkins. 
 Self-promotion in the music business is key to a successful career. There are very few other passions that require as much effort be put towards selling one's self. This book will give you great ideas, like how to write a business plan and how to develop a marketable image. It has information that is especially good for the beginner; it helped me by teaching me how to develop a plan for success. It also helps because it reminds you not to be discouraged by rejection; all artists have to get turned down many times before someone recognizes their potential. This book is totally worth its price, as the information is priceless 
 mr. robbins is very enthusiastic, has a lot of good positive points to make, and i am sure a lot of people will be fired up with his information, but it was too much listing for me....like if you remember these 7 things---etc.  i am more of a wayne dyer fan when it comes to motivation. 
 I've always thought the biggest problem for The Band was that their first two albums were almost too good. Because they were among the best ever released, everything after them was downgraded. Cahoots isn't as bad as a lot of people seem to think and Northern Lights is actually a very good album.  But back to Stage Fright. It isn't as original or groundbreaking as the first two. But compared to almost everything released by anyone in the 35 years since this was issued, it's still an A-plus.  Maybe it is, as one reviewer suggests, symbolic of Robertson's frustration with Manuel's (and Danko's) substance abuse problems. That  makes it more personal and less roots-based than the first two, one reason it's been downgraded. Big Pink and The Band were groundbreaking albums. Stage Fright was similar (although much better) to a lot of albums in the early '70s.  In any case, I'm happy that The Band seems to be getting the respect in the 21st century that it got only sporadically during its peak years (68-72). Even though the music world ranked them with the Beatles (see Clapton's comments) I don't think any album sold more than 800,000 copies, a piddling number today. I suspect the reissues might have done close to that and I love the fact that people who weren't born during their heyday now love them.  One aside about this album: the title song isn't a reference to Richard or Rick. It was Robbie's problem: literally the stage fright he experienced just before The Band's debut (as The Band, not The Hawks) in San Francisco.     
 This was by far the best film of the series and Anita Mui has never been better. Let's face it folks, we don't buy these films because of the story, the great philosophical message it conveys, or the Oscar worthy performances. Get over it guys....this was a great action flick that should please Anita Mui fans. It's one of the few roles she's had that lets her strut her stuff and she dominates the film 
 I like this workout, it is about an hour long and while it is billed as a step workout, there are lots of toning moves for the lower body as well.  Overall a good leg and bun shaper and you will feel it.  Led by Kathy Smith, she is joined by a fairly large class, mostly female who are of various fitness levels.   The workout is broken up into 5 sections, the first being a 9 minute warmup which uses the step for part of it.  Then you will move into segment one which is mostly step, broken down into 2 step sequences.  The first sequence includes over the tops, tap up/downs with some variation, knee raises, side to side knees, side/rear leg lifts, and half squats later adding side and rear leg lifts, this combination is repeated once.  The second sequence includes some more over the tops, rocking horse with straight and bent legs, can can (or kick the can) and charlestons.  Power moves are demonstrated by some of the backgrounds and can be added if you choose.  Segment two includes more toning work with more traditional step moves performed in between.  You will do squats, lunges (Kathy calls them dips), one legged squats, half squats, in between each of these you will do straddles with a side leg lift or front knee lift while changing over to the other side.  Towards the end you will do 4 pulsing squats then hop to the other side and repeat 7 times alternating sides.  This ups the heartrate a bit before cooling down and preparing for the floorwork.  Segment 3 is all floorwork, Kathy and her class uses the step as a prop but I do the routine without it.  You will start with inner thigh lifts, then outer thigh lifts both which have pulses added.  Then you will do an exercise where you bend your knees and keep your feet together and open up the knees.  Other workouts I have seen that have this move refer to it as clams.  These three exercises are then repeated on the other side.  Some of the exercisers will use ankle weights or hand weights for added resistance, I personally would not recommend ankle weights for the 3rd exercise though.  Then you move onto your back and do some work for the hamstrings and behind.  The only exercise here is glute lifts, you start with both legs then alternate each leg.  Cooldown and stretch follows.  Overall, this is a good step routine with lower body emphasis, I wouldn't call it a true "cardio" workout though, the total amount of pure stepping is rather short.  While I don't have many videos by Kathy, I like her style and instruction, she is good with form pointers and helpful tips, as well as modifications.  She does a nice job here.  
 Constance Chatterley's gamekeeper, Mellors, brings out the animal in Her Ladyship, and he extends the protection to her that he does to all the wild game in the wood.  It is Mellors himself who, in the end, understands that his own baronet, Sir Clifford, is the greatest threat to his most vulnerable charge.  Constance's own father, Sir Malcolm, fails utterly to appreciate the situation when he refers to Mellors as the quintessential poacher himself.  Sir Malcolm's mistake is that he, along with all of polite society, fails to recognize that humans are, in fact, animals, and that the thrill of conjugal intimacy unites us with all other fauna.  We strayed from this notion long ago, with Plato extolling virtuous love, and referring to passions and desires as evil (Book IX of the Phaedrus).     Sir Clifford, who is impotent as a result of war injuries, suggests to his wife that she have a discrete affair in order to produce an heir to the estate.   "I don't care who his father may be as long as he is a healthy man not below normal intelligence."  His admonition that Connie be careful not to fall in love in the process foreshadows his tragedy.  When we see the gamekeeper, Mellors, placing pheasant eggs into the nests of chickens, in order that they may be reared by surrogate hens, we know, before any of the protagonists themselves, just who Lady Chatterley's surrogate husband will be.  Ultimately Connie discovers that Mellors has that rarest of qualities in a man; he enjoys making love only when his partner enjoys it, too.  These feelings are a sharp contrast with her experience as well as his, and they are both immediately ensnared in a tense carnal conspiracy.  In the process, we are treated to D. H. Lawrence's craft:  "Both sisters mixed with...the young Cambridge group, the group that stood for 'freedom' and flannel trousers, and soft shirts open at the neck, and a well-bred sort of emotional anarchy..., and an ultra-sensitive sort of manner."  Tevershall village had "rows of wretched, small begrimed brick houses with black slate roofs for lids, sharp angles, and willful blank dreariness."  One attraction of her first lover, Michalis, is that he had his own ideas and stated them clearly; "he didn't merely walk round them with millions of words, in the parade of the life of the mind."  Sir Clifford "seemed alert in the foreground, but the background was like the Midlands atmosphere, haze, smoky mist."  Before her affair with Mellors, Connie saw sex as "just a cocktail term for an excitement that bucked you up for a while, then left you more raggy than ever."  Connie realizes of Clifford that, "like many insane people, his insanity might be measured by the things he was not aware of: the great desert tracts in his consciousness."  "She saw her own nakedness in his eyes..."   This book will not titillate the reader of 2006 as it did the reader of 1928.  The reaction against it then exposed both widespread hypocrisy and a scientifically illiterate, pre-Kinsey society which extolled Platonic values, and in the process denied the incomparable delight of primitive intimacy.  
 I bought this book for my two and a half year old daughter who has a severe peanut allergy.  She enjoys the book, and I feel it is developmentally appropriate for her.  It includes symptoms of peanut allergies, as they pertain to Allie, which hopefully will help her identify a reaction when it happens to her 
 Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning, fictionalized biography of Oskar Schindler memorializes a member of the Nazi party who endangered his own life for four years, working privately to save Jews from the death camps. A playboy who loved fine wines and foods, he was also a smooth-talking manipulator (and briber) of Nazi officials, as well as a clever entrepreneur, already on his way to stunning financial success by the early days of World War II. Nowhere in Schindler's background are there any hints that he would one day become the savior of eleven hundred Jewish men and women.   While the excellent film of this novel concentrates on the dangers Schindler and "his Jews" faced daily throughout the war, Keneally, well known for his depictions of characters acting under stress, concentrates on the character of Oskar Schindler himself, beginning with his childhood and teen years. As he explores Schindler's transformation from war profiteer and "passive" Nazi to a man willing to use his fortune to ensure the salvation of his factory workers, Keneally reveals a man of enormous courage and derring-do, a man who thrives by living on the edge.   Presenting episodes from the lives of some of the "Schindlerjuden," Keneally highlights their humanity, creating moments of high drama. Characters such as Leopold Pfefferberg and factory manager Itzhak Stern move in and out of the narrative, illustrating graphically the extent to which their lives depend upon Oskar Schindler, while the constant intrusion of sadistic SS commandant Amon Goeth in Schindler's life shows the fragility of their security. Other stories, of people who just missed being saved by Schindler, highlight the arbitrariness of fate--chance--in their (and our) lives.   Throughout the novel, Keneally stresses the importance of bearing witness and testifying to the atrocities. In one of the novel's most moving passages, Schindler and his lover ride horses to a ridge where they can view the expulsion of the Jews from the Krakow ghetto, watching, horrified, as old or crippled laggards are murdered in front of Jewish children. "They permitted witnesses because they believed the witnesses, all, would perish, too." Later, Schindler works with a Zionist rescue organization, secretly going to Budapest to testify about the hidden death camps.   Schindler's heroism, his goodness within a country committed to the extermination of other humans, his recognition that witnesses are essential, and his ability to use the system in order to hasten its end bring this story of one man's fight against the Holocaust to life. But it is Keneally's incorporation of Schindler's faults and excesses which gives texture and depth to this portrait and make Schindler a character with whom the reader can identify. Keneally's meticulous research and his portrait of Schindler after the war, beloved by Jews but at loose ends personally and professionally, make this novel an unforgettable study of character and time.

 Timeless music! Tight beats with songs that motivate. "Time Is Ticking" 
 I recently had the pleasure of watching a film starring the Hunkiest specimen of Man-meat ever to grace the silver screen. It was Rudy Ray Moore in Dolemite. Let me start off by saying this is quite possibly the finest film ever made. Dolemite himself is a man so baaad that he doesn't even feel the need to be in good shape to impress us, he let's his martial arts do the talkin'. If Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Tony Jaa were all combined into one glorious person they would still aspire to be Dolemite. To the untrained eye it would appear that Dolemite is not actually hitting people in the fight scenes. In reality he is just so fast that he can snap his hands and feet there and back so quickly that it gives the viewer the illusion that his foot is six inches away from the targets head.  This movie also has the flyest honeys ever captured on film. Queen Bee, the leader of Dolemite's kung fu strumpets, somehow manages to become more mesmerizing in each scene.  Dolemite's insults are so cutting that it would make Don Rickles weep uncontrollably. This is a man who knows in order to hurt someone's feelings you need to scream "muthaf***a" at the end of every insult. Also to showcase his wit there are five minute poetry reciting scenes. Some would say these scenes are waaay to long and very unnecessary, but that is just plum rediculous. It shows that he is a jack of all trades.  The emotion also runs rampant in this movie. I cried for hours after the tragic and untimely death of the "Hamburger Pimp". That's right the "Hamburger Pimp". Why hasn't Hollywood thought to name every character in every movie that. This movie is so gritty and real that they decided to make the boom mike visible in numerous scenes just to remind the audience that its just a movie.  All in all, if you see one movie in your entire life make it Dolemite 
 I own several books on science fun for kids.  I consider this one of the better ones for ages 9-14.  Although there are some ideas carried through several pages, almost every activity stands on its own.  Each concoction is presented on its own page with a catchy title like "Soda Slobber" and sections headed "What You Need," "What You Do," and "Why It Works."  I liked the scientific explanations--very clear and readable.  There are also several one-page articles like "What Makes Your Pop POP" that go into more detailed explanations of the chemistry behind the concoctions.  The concoctions mostly consist of experiments with acid/base reactions, air pressure, liquid densities, Ph indicators, and carbonation, plus recipes for polymers, crystals, paint and invisible ink.  The text stands on its own; the kid-friendly illustrations are merely decorative.  Some recipes do require ingredients that are not readily available every house, such as citric acid or tincture of iodine, but the book mentions in general terms whether they can be purchased in a drugstore or grocery store.  A lot of the experiments involve things that splash or are otherwise very messy, but the reader is cautioned to do them outside.  I am looking forward to using the geyser made from soda pop and lifesavers with my day camp geology classes--I expect it to be a highlight of the class.  And although many of the activities can be found in other books (is there a kids' chemistry book anywhere that does NOT tell how to make slime, create a baking soda volcano, or separate the colors that make up black ink?), the geyser, the Air Freshener Bubbles (made with vanilla extract), and Tie Be Gone (where you dissolve a piece of old clothing) are three activities that I do not recall seeing in other books 
 If you like books closer to real life, where the line between villian and victim is grey, you will probably find this a very good book.   I thoroughly enjoyed this book for the main reason many didn't, you had to look to your own moral compass to distinguish sinner and saint and not rely on the author to all but spell it out for you.  Which I believe gets us just a little more acquainted with who we are.   John Grisham, as his manner is, takes the reader on another crash course of law, in this book, tort litigation.  John Grisham is adept at weaving this education into his books without you realizing it until you get into a conversation with someone and the things you read roll of your tongue as if you are an expert yourself.   The story line was excellent, interesting and insightful.  However, the romance is a bit vague and disconneted (to me this has never been one of Grisham's strong suits anyway).  Overall, I found it to be a book hard to put down 
 i don't understand why exactly, but rick moody seems to make some readers angry.  the characters are unlikeable, they say.  the sentences are too long.  does reading nabakov make the same readers angry?  maybe they stumbled onto the ice storm expecting something else, something safe.  ignore them.     rick moody taps into the part of the world you only notice when you're really looking.  he's funny and he's sad and i would hang out in this book forever, because the way the characters see things makes total sense to me. "Blundering into the kitchen, he felt sure that it would always be this way, this blunt little diorama of a life with its cessation of miracles would never change--except that it would get worse. 
 My wife and I have long been fans of Fiestaware and we have been using many of their pieces for years. Somehow it wasn't until about 2 years ago that we discovered this size. At 9" the lunch plate is perfect for many occasions - especially lunch! (smile)   The quality of these plates is very good and this size is very uselul. For some reason these are seldom seen as part of a standard set. We use ours all the time...   Highly Recommended!  
 A review of the book production, not the contents.  I would not recommend the 25th Anniversary Hardback Edition, simply on account of poor production values:  1. It has a perfect, not a stitched binding, so it doesn't open out flat but snaps back together like a theatre seat.  2. The type is actually difficult to read because the ink used is shiny and the typeface is not crisp.  It looks to me like the wrong ink and paper were used - they don't work together.  I have given 5 stars so as not to interfere with the rating of the book itself, which is of course superb; but I would give this particular edition a miss 
 I just bought the book today after leafing through it at a local comic book store in New York.  The concept art is great.  All three artists are very talented.  So why shockingly good?  Here's why.  These guys are young- very young to be this good.  Art is a function of talent, focus, and practicing the craft.  It's apparent that these kids have done all three 
 This album is the most straight-forward rock that you could expect from a band featuring Patton since Faith No More. This is almost certainly a result of Duane Denison's leading role in the project, rather than the band being under Patton's thumb. This album is mostly hard rock, with a sound as cutting and chilling as an axe on metal. There are occasional gentler moments, such as Point and Click, which serve as something like an oasis between the crushing riffs of the harder songs. The drums are simplistic, but particular catchy, the riffs are hardcore enough for the strongest rock fan, but enjoyable enough for the casual listener, and of course Patton's vocals turn this work into a masterpiece. For particular album highlights, see '101 North', 'God Hates a Coward', 'Sir Yes Sir' and 'Laredo'.   It's interesting to see this CD in retrospect to 'Mit Gas', because you can see the evolution of Tomahawk. I'm not sure which I prefer, but one thing I can say is this: 'Tomahawk' is well worth your money, and even if it takes a few listens, the effort is well worth the result 
 This book is actually fiction, although it intended to be used as a instructional manual for implementing a new approach to project management.  As a project manager I think the book is very practical and I think his approach would work very well for many projects.  However, the theory that Goldratt proposes goes against all of the other commonly used project management tools (Gantt, Critical Path, PERT) that are based on timelines and milestones.    The book is written from a common-sense approach (in contrast to the approach used by textbooks) and some of the problems it addresses are: 1. Projects often run over budget but rarely finish under budget 2. Multitasking is actually detrimental to projects  3. Constraints arrise when multiple projects use the same resources 4. The true cost of a project (which Goldratt says is much higher than most think) 5. Negotiations with subcontractors used on a project 6. Net Present Value and payback period are inadequate measurements for the cost of a project  Don't be discouraged if you don't understand any of the typical project management jargon.  Goldratt does a great job of introducing each concept and describing the basic, underlying concepts.  The technical concepts are explained in question-answer form that would be similar to attending a seminar.    Lastly, Goldratt uses two types of projects (product development and construction) as examples in this book.  However, the concepts and his approach could be applicable to many different types of projects.  In my opinion, the determining factor for applicability of Goldratt's approach is the structure of the organization and not the type of project;  the less burocratic, the more applicable 
 Wislawa Szymborska writes with the wit and freshness of the American beat poets, layered with the sence of history and emotional depth that can only come from living through the last seventy years of turmoil in Europe.  She has a very musical style. She begins by building descriptive lines, then rises to a staccato rediscovery of her subject, then resloving each poem with a kind of rational passion that is rare in even the most accomplished poets. 	This book has the added advantage of being the only one of her books that has been translated by people who not only know both tongues, but who understand language, meter, lyric and nuance.  More poems are offered in  View with a Grain of Sand, but not with the level of quality of translation. 	Highly recommened for those who do not want sentimentality, endless rhyming and dull subject matter.  Szymborska is deserving off all of the attention she is finally receiving, and more 
 I had the cassette back in the early 80's, along with Restless Breed and Live E.P. This was my pre-Metallica rock, when after this I needed something harder. But these old Riot CD's, whether it was Guy or Rhett (R.I.P.) singing, was the way hard rock was meant to be. Very heavy in a melodic kind of way, with singing you can understand and sing along with. Since I always loved these guys, I now decided was the time to get these cassettes on CD's, so I can relive the old days of great music forever. Get the newer RIOT cd's also, they never go out of style 
 Deborah Crombie continues to deliver a series worth reading and rereading...this entry is no exception. Balancing jurisdictional disputes, personal life distractions, and a strong sense of historical detail, In a Dark House is another superb example of Crombie's sensitive portrayal of character, place and pitch-perfect plot. If you haven't read her work yet, get them all and be prepared to enter a world you won't want to leave 
 For those of us lacking the resources to excavate occult secrets hidden beneath the Louvre, CIA Headquarters or Rosslyn Chapel, The Key to Solomon's Key is the next best thing.  These pages reveal the true secrets of Solomon, from Masonry to magic.  Lon Milo DuQuette's experience and learning make this fascinating journey through the history of the Bible, Knights Templar, Freemasons, and the Goetia all the more striking because it is real.  Add Mr. DuQuette's inimitable wit and wisdom, and you have a genuine page-turner.  While the reader of this book probably won't be kidnapped, shot or chased around the world, the Most Dangerous Secret in the World will be revealed.  What could be more exciting than that?  Read this book now...before They get to it first 
 From the tone of his voice, to his pimp style attire, to his topics of interest, Kat Williams hits the spot like no other has done for years 
 Bill Hayes has written another winner.  He seamlessly weaves together a history of blood with personal reflections from his own life.  Hayes explores and explains how man's understanding of blood developed not only in science but also the meaning of blood through time in our cultural, social and religious life.  I found this aspect of the book educational and fascinating.   	 At the same time, Hayes interweaves reflections and experiences from his own childhood and adult life.  These reflections are laugh out-loud funny, heartbreakingly sad and profoundly intimate.  In particular he focuses on his experience as a gay man in the age of AIDS and his long term relationship with a partner with AIDS.  Through the lens of blood, this is another perspective on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in our lives; one that I believe has never really been explored before.  He also describes the current impact of AIDS in the age of effective treatments on those affected and infected.  This is important and has until now been left unsaid.  While the impact of AIDS is no longer certain death, it still has enormous ramifications on our personal lives and in our communities.  Blood gives Hayes the vehicle to describe this beautifully.   
 I have been happy with the performance of this bra in terms of control, but the fabric is not the softest. Washing hasn't softened it, but it's not intolerable. 
 A repetitive chorus of female voices, moaning, wailing, like a train heard passing from nowhere to nowhere at three in the morning, this is the coldest offering to the ear I've ever heard. And yet, somehow, it fits both Rothko's work and the manner of his death. After the Zen no-mind of the first four tracks, Feldman embraces his listeners and--by proxy--Rothko's spirit--in the 5th track, which offers us a "warm" and charming cello motif, that the composer, in his collected writings, tells us he composed at age 15. Rothko Chapel is then, a radical listening experience of "outside" (as in interstellar space), and "inside" (as in some catchy riff lifted from Dvorak's "American").     "Why Patterns" is more familiar Feldman territory: think aural disjunction, fragmentation, etc.     Exciting, challenging, memorable--these are the three key words I would apply to this CD.     
 I saw this movie in the theatre as a teen.  I have seen it on cable but sooo much was cut.  I bought this for my 17 year old daughter for a gift.  She laughed and cried in all the traditional places and has added it to her favorite list.  I am sure that it will be shared, one day, with her daughter - far in the future 
  "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." 2 Peter 3:3, 4  "Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 24:45-51  Scoffing is smiting, have to expect it as Jesus said this will happen when people tell it straight. Hal told it straight. 
 This book seriously makes you think. NOt only is it suspenseful, it's a teen angst novel, too. It shows you what happens when peer pressure goes too far. The characters are belivable, and sometimes you hate them, and other times, you wish that they're your best friend, especially Mark, who later on in the book has a suprise secret that will leave you in a cold sweat 
 I am at a total loss for words... it was incredibly difficult to watch, but so worth it 
 Pete Stoeffella in his down-to-earth matter-of-fact manner has collected some of the best information available for the grower. Indeed it is the best composting information available today. Without good compost returned to the soil growers will find an inabilably to sustain good yields. This books shows growers how a good compost is made and how it is best used while bringing to light many of compost's best qualities such as water retention as well as good drainage, nutrient retention, nutrient availability, and suppression of many diseases. This book is a resourse and reference book for any organic gardener and is sure to become an integral part of "closing the loop" on a resource previously considered disposable waste 
 If 1) you have never had a guitar lesson, 2) no one has ever taught you how to play four or five basic chords and 3) you are a good sit-by-yourself-and-learn kind of person, this book may be just what you are looking for. I bought it as a gift to give along with a person's first guitar - and it worked for them! Good luck to you, too 
 The table of contents started me drooling (look in the See-Inside-the-Book above). The book makes good use of readily available seafood plus fresh fruits (for fruit cobbler or a sundae).  Sure, the recipes may be found in a variety of cookbooks, but this pulls together the ones you want while at the ocean. A few recipes use ingredients that I wouldn't have on hand (capers, chickpea flour), but most are straight forward.  The color photographs really whet your appetite.   This was favorably reviewed by the Baltimore Sun saying it "captures the evocative moods of summer. 
 This book is fantastic. Evans outlines everything from the direction that audio waves are received depending on which external mic is used, to the compression rate for web movies. The book is incredibly up to date, as it should be considering it just came out. The set up of the book is very much like the 'for dummies' series, considering that there are projects along the way for you to undertake to sharpen your skills, along with info and ww link boxes. Most other books out there just outline what you need to do but don't tell you how to do things. This book really tells you what is going on when your making a film, and just doesn't say, if you do this then the picture will look pretty. He gets technical, and that's what needs to be said to give people getting into this a better understanding of what they are doing . He starts off with a great intro, for those who are just getting into digital filmmaking it really outlines what needs to be done to succeed. He identifies each technical aspect that he is going to cover, and then goes on to explain how you need to get to know your camera. Its obvious that a ton of research has been put into this book, as it really tells you everything you could possibly need to know. If you buy this book first then there really is no need for any other book out there. I've read this book cover to cover 1 time so far, and plan on reading it 2 more times.            
 This was money well spent. This book is more than the title implies. First it is a selected biography of Stephen King. I enjoyed the poison ivy episode. This is not a deviation but an explanation of why he writes the way he does and the background that he draws on. Secondly this is a "how to write like Stephen King" book it reflects his likes and dislikes. I agree with most of them. I suppose that that is why I like his novels.   However I can only guess that he must spend a lot of time around people that cuss. It is not like he is not aware of it. I feel that he is somewhat proud of the fact that he cusses a lot. Luckily he said it is not necessity to be excessive.   I share his dislike for flashbacks. And he also expresses several dislikes for other stilting crutches, including excessive description of Back-story.  An added bonus is his description of the van accident that a certain comedian commented about saying that Stephen lost his Tommyknockers. Stephen forgot to mention that he bought the van that hit him for destruction purposes. Talk about revenge.   Over all after reading this I was compelled to try my hand at writing.   
 Whether you are liberal, conservative, or somewhere in between, you will find something to disagree with in this book.  You need to read it, however, because it is THE modern classic in the study of the just war tradition.  Much that came after is a direct reply to Walzer.  This isn't easy reading, but making the effort rewards the reader--and always gives you something important to think about 
 This is a great DVD a must have.. i almost did not purchase it but i am glad that i did.. you will see result 
 I expected a well written book from Masterson, and was not disappointed.  Subjects covered from the full spectrum of what it takes to be a great leadser, from manners, to public speaking, to handling a crises or making a decision. While I've read hundreds of books on these subjects, I appreciated the fresh approach, and had several new ideas while reading.   All great advice, more than a sales/persuasion book. a compendeum of leadership advice 
 A good follow up to Manhatten is my beat . This second Rune  novell takes the reader on the usual Deaver ride and leaves them kicking themselves for not guessing the final twist of the plot .  Although not as captivating as the Lincoln Rhyme series , Rune's individuality and attitude  grabs the reader and brings them into the story . The only down-side , for me is that it portrays Australians the wrong way to an international audience . Loved it all the same  
 Definitely "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction" is not J. D. Salinger's most popular and most read work. People who read this book are die-hard fans of this writer and really like the Glass family and are interested in knowing more about them. Those who want to read only one or two Salinger books should stick to "The Catcher in The Rye" and either "Franny and Zooey" or "Nine Stories".  To begin with "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction" is not an easy book. Its rhythm is like a roller coaster, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes up, sometimes down -- but always difficult and inaccessible to those who are not familiar with the Glass's mythology and history. Even Salinger habitus may find some difficult in reading this work.   "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters" tells the story of Seymour's wedding. But, the main character here and narrator is Buddy Glass, the groom's brother, who is the only member of the family to attend the ceremony. All the narrative deals with the fact that Seymour abandon's his bride in the church and doesn't show up.   Buddy is forced to deal whit the situation. He is forced to be with some guests, who happen to be bride's relative. And most of the time he pretends not to be Seymour's brother. Like most Salinger's work, the most important thing in the narrative is the character's thoughts rather than his actions, words etc.   While considering this event, Buddy recreates most of his family's history. And this is a valuable account to those are interested in learn more about the Glasses. So far, sort of a typical Salinger writing.   The second part "Seymour: An Introduction" is more difficult and problematic to those readers. First thing is that is not an introduction -- at least not our typical introduction. First off, because the reader is already familiar with Seymour, from "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters", or from "A Perfect Day the Bananafish" (from "Nine Stories", which happens to be paradoxical, since the short story tells an event that happens later on in the character's life).  Buddy who describes his older brother -- who he happens to admire-- again narrates the story. The narrative this time round is like a labyrinth rather than a roller coaster. The images are formed without a correlation, the narrator jumps from topic to topic making the understanding of his words rather difficult.   Those who are interested in only one Seymour story should go straight to "A Perfect day for Bananafish". It is short, but you'll learn a lot about the character -- actually almost everything you need to know is there. Those who like Salinger and his Glass family, are welcome to read "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction", but be advised that it is different (not bad, just different) from what you've read from him, about them.  
 Robert Graves is known for his eccentricities and eclectic readings of the classic Greek myths.  But this is the definitive edition because it gives the literary sources, from Homer to Pausanias and many others.  I also own the Folio Society's slipcased, handsomely illustrated edition of the same work.  For reasons that I cannot even guess at, its editors decided to omit the sources, an omission that I believe destroys its value.  The only problem with the paperback edition is that it wears out sooner rather than later, but the price is such that replacing it is affordable 
   Excellent film.  The action in Schwarzenegger films is renowned.  Often the writing, in the action films at least, is as well.  This film ranks at the top!  Truly a discussion film.  Was it all a dream, did it really happen, What about the girl, the blue sky?  There's plenty of evidence to support both sides of the discussion.  Try it, you'll like it!!  No discussion there 
   Dan Abnett, the flagship author of the Black Library, returns to his longest running and most loved series, the tale of Commissar-Colonel Ibram Gaunt and his Ghosts in The Armour of Contempt.  Set against the backdrop of a vast empire of humanity in a state of constant war, the Gaunts Ghosts series follows the military actions of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, a campaign involving hundreds of millions of soldiers waging in a battle against close to fifty enemy occupied worlds.     Abnett is one of the best contemporary science fiction authors in his genre and quite possibly in the industry. His ability to seamlessly move from the scifi-noir style of his Eisenhorn Trilogy to the cyberpunk-intrigue of Ravenor to the dark, brutal and gritty military reality of the Gaunts Ghost series underscores a versatility and tonal mastery that is a rare commodity in modern fiction.  His talent not only lies within his use of nuance and tone but with incredibly deep characterization,  engrossing dialogue and imaginative setting.  Those of you reading this review who are not already familiar with Abnett's Gaunt's Ghost  series should stop reading now. The Armour of Contempt is the 9th book in a series that spans over a decade of exploits across half a dozen worlds, start at the beginning with  Abnett's First Gaunt's Ghost novel, First and Only. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.     The rest of my fellow readers, who have been following the Sabbat Worlds Crusade for the past nine books, are in for a treat.  The Armour of Contempt is an excellent continuation of this dramatic series.  Set several years of brutal campaigning after the previous novel, His Last Command, Abnett's latest installment sees a dramatic return to the chaos occupied and infested planet Gereon with the Ghosts at the forefront of a world-wide planetary invasion, an invasion that may have come years too late. For the first time in the series we are shown aspects of war in the 41st millennium that the Ghosts do not normally participate in, we are given first hand experiences of the hells of frontal planetary assault with thousands of regiments of Imperial Guard marching under the feet of colossal titans in assaults on fortresses miles in length.  Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives are sacrificed in the attempt to liberate a planet whose population may no longer be able to benefit from their freedom.  Gereon Resists, yes, but is there anyone left  but the dead and the Ghosts? 
 I'm so pleased to see this title back in print. I read it, and re-read it, and re-re-read it many times as a young teen. And I owe this book the credit for my two precious children, who joined our family shortly after their births. 
 This book is a good guide to your MTB and covers the full spectrum. Item was cheaper than others, excellent condition, and shipped extremely fast. 
 I'm a student of a culinary school and this book helps me a lot.  You can find everything about cooking techniques, sauces, tools, measures, you name it!!  It is very simple and accurate. If you love food, you must have this book 
 My title is way to simplistic for this story, but it gives you an idea.  Tananarive Due brings us a unique look into suspense and horror that I have not seen before, giving us a cultural lesson at the same time.  An engrossing read.  I couldn't put it down 
 This is *not* a toddler only shape book at all!  I read this to a mixed age 6-9 year old class & they got alot out of it.  It was for Autumn Moon Festival but you cd/ do it for any China intro.  I also passed around things from the book: a Chinese teacup with no handle,  an abacus, a chop, the chop ink's square box was 'the box my cats sleep in' although mine were plastic tiger, panther & lion!  Even if you had nothing I don't think it wd/ be difficult to buy a few cheaply at your local Asian food store or borrow things from friends & parents 
 I like keeping all my stuff in one place, but don't like CD folders, so these slim cases are great.  I accidentaly sat on one of them and although it did crack, the case didn't break, and the cd was fine.  All in all, a great product 
 What's so fascinating is the language the author uses.  English being my second language, I had a little hard time to understand the details.  There are a lot of vernaculars, the Irish English, so you do have to get used to it.  But after the first chapter, you'll do just fine.  In fact, you'll fall in love with the way O'Neill uses the language.  It is written in third person omniscient, but he frequently goes back and forth 3rd person and 1st person between dialogues and narratives, goes in and out of the minds of the characters.  He does it so naturally and freely that you don't feel strange at all.  His writing is very strong and confident that you feel completely secure, like you're in the hands of God.  Very professional.  The characters are all loveable, especially the boys and even MacMurrough.  Mr. Mack is a little snobbish, but he, too, is quite likeable as a father.  You will have sympathy for him. The women were somewhat mystery.  I think they have more representative roles.  Jim Mack doesn't have a mother.  Doyler doesn't have a real father.  Both boys are so very sweet and loving toward their families, and they are good to their parents, and the parents good to their children.  McMurrough, too, is good to his aunt, and the aunt is good to her nephew.  It is rare to find a story of people who treat their families with love and respect. The three main characters, Jim, Doyler and MacMurrough, are all unique in their own ways, and each of them goes through a transformation.  MacMurrough is the most complicated case, I actually liked him very much.  His imaginative dialogues with Scorates, Dick, and Nanny are quite interesting, almost intellectual in some part.  He's a round character, I guess.  At one point he acts like a decent adult man, with good conscience, another time he acts like a vulgar villain.  Preditor at the same time protector, slave to his desire at the same time self-disciplined.  The boys are supposed to be his victims, yet they both love him and rely on him. Doyler's pretty much set with his personality.  A brilliant kid, doomed in poverty.  He's my favorite. Jim was the one who surprised me and worried me the most.  He sinks into guilt and fear about his sexuality at one point, and I thought he was going to fall out of the friendship, but then after he got sick, he comes out of it completely, and becomes the boldest.  This sudden transformation was a bit too quick and unsupported, to me.  He's made of both childlike innocence and cunny shrewdness.  Over all, the sweetest one.  Beside the main story, there's a side story of the friendship between Mr. Mack and Mr. Doyle, the unfortunate fallout.  Paralleling with growing friendship between the boys, the dwindling friendship between the two old men is ironic, and representative.  The story deals with poverty, class, religion, politics, war, human sexuality, and many more.  The life in Ireland in the early 1900s comes vividly alive in this book, and you'll keep on turning the pages.  The characters are well developed, you'll get to know each one well. The author is pretty good at not revealing how the ending's going to be.  It's a tragedy, yet it's not as heartbreaking as I had anticipated.  In any case, the way the author uses the language is breathtaking.  That alone is worth a read.    
 I had this item previously, and was searching for a replacement. I purchased other epilators but they didn't come close to doing the job emjoi did 
 After checking the exorbitant prices of foreign magazines and Billboard Magazine I love my suscription to Rolling Stone Magazine. Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with the good folks that say that too many uneventful acts are being given undue praise. And yes, obviously it is not the same magazine of yesteryears. I do recognize the fact that times are indeed changing all the time and Rolling Stone has changed as well. But seriously folks, where else you are going to find the awesome deal of a Rolling Stone suscription? Talk about affordable to the masses. Yes, I checked the prices for Uncut, Mojo, Melody Maker? (or something like that) and the prices were downright ridiculous. Not everyone has the inclination to dish out $9-$12 dollars for a sucription. Oh yes, the English have the edge, their magazines are sooo vital, no air between the ears type music journalism, more and more accolades for them and abuse and criticism for Rolling Stone. I agree some of their reviews such as James Brown's "Live at the Apollo" making it a 5 star album is just not so and I bought it for the review. All these Hip-Hop taking center stage, all these blank acts that have yet to make their mark, but hey, you know what? It informs you, it lets you know what is going on out there and once in a while some serious journalism is to be enjoyed. All the politics pisses me off but some of the more dark essays sometimes grab my attention, but here is the grabber: For the same price of the ridiculous expensive imported magazines you can buy a lifetime suscription from Rolling Stones! I mean, till the day you cross the treshold and all the earthly subjects will no longer have any bearing in the state of things. If you are 20 that is 40, 50, 60 years of delivery to your door. What does that break down to? Actually and I am no Mathematician but I am sure it breaks down to Zero for an all American Music Magazine. Take your criticism overseas because Rolling Stone is a great buy any way you slice it and you can take that to the bank. Some awesome reporters have graced the covers of this magazine so do not give me any flak and some great articles too! Boo Whoo, Boo Whoo, Rolling Stone is a great buy, now what? 
 i bought the book after reading a shorter tolstoy story, years ago. at first i was intimidated by the length of this story and couldnt get into it to start. finally, i picked it up again and was dissapointed i waited so long, it definitely doesnt seem as long once you get going. its an amazing book and has become one of my favorite 
 How do writers create the characters for their books?  Writer Lois Lowry answers this question in this beautiful book of memories. Each individual memory with accompanying black and white photograph illustrates an important event in the author's life.  Together they weave a story that is impossible to put down and leaves the reader wanting more. There is humor reminiscent of Erma Bombeck and sadness that makes you want to weep.   Lois Lowry includes quotes from characters in her books echoing experiences that are provided in the memories.  The death of her sister is found in Number The Stars, her grandparent's house is in Autumn Street, and her son and his horse in The Giver, and she herself in books like Anastasia Krupnik and The One Hundredth Thing about Caroline.  Read this book to learn more about a new friend or to find a new one 
 Lots of meal recipes for eating healthy with minimal preparation time. I recommend this book to all my friends. It is especially good for single people because lots of recipes are for one person. There are also chapters on slow-cooker recipes and Zone meals for kids. It's a five-star all the way 
 This item is available at few places. Needed to gift someone! Our friend loved it 
 This is one of my favorite books I own. Saul Williams is a brillant writer. 
 Wallerstein argues about how knowledge is constituted. This is essential thinking in a time where we see battles about what a 'theory' is, what history means, and how a 'reality based' perspective is really a more deeply moral position. Wallerstein knows that knowledge is a human attribute. He discusses science as "an essential human adventure, perhaps the great human adventure," as opposed to 'Scientism' which he argues is an ossified claim that "science is disinterested and extra-social, that it's truth claims are self-sustaining without reference to more general philosophical assertions, and that science represents the only legitimate mode of knowledge."   Deep respect to such a thoughtful scholar and thinker who humbly states that world is rally only partially knowable.   It reminds me that the people to watch out for are the people who think they are right all the time, a product of 'unshakable faith' rather than their capacity to reason.  
  This book has it all... intrigue, humor, sex, drugs, dolphins, age old plots of world domination! Although the narrative is presented with total disregard for plot continuity and without any discernable timeframe the reader is nontheless drawn into the outrageous sprawling story. Some parts of the book are confusing and somewhat dull but there are more than enough good bits to keep one turning the pages into the night.   If one has a penchant for a good conspiracy story he or she will definately get a kick out of The Illuminatus! 
 It is, in my opinion, the second best Anne book! Its Anne's wedding! The whole thing is soaked in romance! Leslie's story is so amazing and sweet that you have to love her. Captain Jim is so sweet and perfect, you can nearly see him. Miss Cornelia is funny and Susan is great. Anne has to deal with tragedy and joy that makes the books so wonderful. The only thing I don't like, is that i wish Marrilla and all the Avonlea people would be in it a little more. In my opinion, this should be where the series ends 
 I don't know if Ayn Rand has much profile over here in Europe. I had heard a little about her ideas and the passion with which they are held, and their seeming influence in the US. An interesting read.  This book doesn't really cover Objectivism as a philosophy, but rather the manner of its propagation. Still, any philosophy with an originator and adherents like these shrill, overbearing, self-obsessed, childless horrors is worth avoiding.  Could any other culture than the American one have incubated and given growth space to such an elaborate rationale for grandiose narcissism?  Yep, she was a cult alright. An utter cult 
 Sharp, taut, seriously funny and tremendously sad. Comparable in many ways to Denis Johnson's Jesus' Son, but with greater range.  A beautiful book that I just can't stop reading and re-reading 
 I don't really care if the things in Rhiannon Ryall's book are accurate, or if they're not. All I know is I enjoyed the book and got quite a bit out of it. I'm now in the middle of my second reading of the book and it is a real pleasure. Her writing style has been criticized by some reviewers but, frankly, it's quite pleasing and relaxed. It's the writing style of someone who is more comfortable talking to people than writing to them. If you wish to make comparisons, you might say the style of Wicca she describes in comparison to modern day, over  elaborate Wicca, is the same as the difference between an old fashioned country Baptist church and the over elaborate Catholic church. In religions of all types there is the simple, direct communion with your god contrasting with the overbearing pomp and flash who's main objective is to be seen and heard by others. I'll take the simple and direct every time. I like "West Country Wicca". It's a good book and a worthwhile read, no matter which direction your path takes. 
 In MY JIM, as Sadie, a former slave, and her granddaughter, Marianne, piece together a quilt, Sadie pieces together her own story, gradually revealing the history of the items she has kept for years in a canning jar:  a small knife, a piece of felt, the bottom of a clay bowl, a child's tooth, a shiny gold button, and a corn pipe thick with tar.  The contents of the jar represent a lifetime of misery, pain, heartache, and survival.  "I gives you my first heart Marianne.  The heart I gots for my mama.  And the heart I gots for my Jim." In those few words, Rawles lets the main character, Sadie, tell us her stark truth: To survive a brutal life that would drive some to suicide or madness, Sadie has allowed few people into her "first heart."  Living as a slave, Sadie learns quickly that friends, family, even your own children, can be wrenched from you with no warning. But Jim enters a young Sadie's "first heart" on the day he is born and lives in it always; his love for her, her love for him, and the hope of his return carry Sadie through years of soul-deadening losses.     Rawles writes simply, relating the most gut-wrenching scenes with control and reserve, with a matter-of-factness that serves to underscore the fact that Sadie's losses were not uncommon but rather a fact of life for a person in bondage. As I read MY JIM, I wondered about the other Sadies and Jims that walked this earth, knowing that this story isn't the story of one but of many.  I finished the book with tears forming, a weight on my chest, and admiration for the writing of Nancy Rawles.  She has produced a work of art.                   
 Fun, serious, and thoroughly readable.  Chris Bolgiano weaves grounded environmentalism and ecological awareness with history and stories/case studies to bring our awareness to a complex subject.  This book presents solid Appalachian forest information to the reader in a manner that keeps one reading.  Forests are complex, there are many approaches and techniques to sustainability, and Ms. Bolgiano seems to get to most.  Simply, I found this book a delight to read and I learned so much from it 
 I was recommended this book from my friend shortly after finishing graduate school when in need of a good detox-read.  To me the book was far from the brainless entertainment I was hoping for.  In fact, Invisible Cities was full of thought provoking and poetic images of imaginary cities expressed through dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublia Khan.  At first I was struck by the unusual premise for the story and then later struck by the highly symbolic descriptions of the cities.  Through Calvino's use of symbolism I began to have a different appreciation for the forms and structures of cities and civilizations.  This could have been the first time I really thought about cities as a living architecture and the container for our memories and dreams.    With all of the above said, one problem I had when reading Invisible Cities was my mind seemed to easily drift off the page.  The book reads more like poetry then a novella and I felt that halfway through the book the form of the chapters became almost too redundant.  I think that if I were to re-read the book and spend some time with it I could have gained greater insight into Italo Calinvo's perspective and creative mind.  Although I am not rushing to re-read it anytime soon, I would possibly read it again in the future 
 I had no idea what was this book about, I just knew that Michael Pollan wrote this amazing meat article for the NY Times a few years ago and decided to buy all his 3 books (a 4th one coming out). This one (A place of my own) is about him building a studio in the woods behind his house, with architect designs and carpenter's help. I learned tons on house building ... the most interesting thing though is that this book encompass an history lesson on any parts of the house (how were things built before, why were they built that way, what do we do now) ...   Michael read and quotes several other books about architecture, relations between human and the habitat ... thanks for opening my eyes  
 This book has everyting as it pertains to network security monitoring. If you read this book from cover-to-cover, then you can consider yourself prepared to deal with anything that comes at you. This book presents material that would normally take years to learn in an easy-to-follow format. This book is a must have for anyone who is serious about their job and wants to make the jump to becoming an expert 
 Pros: Good price. Works properly. Cons: There is some black/brown substance after use in the remaining water, as expected. It takes some wiggling/shaking with upside down position of the container to make sure it is all cleaned up. Still a good buy to me.  
 As the story unfolds in twentith century brooklyn, 2 kids look for something to do.  Nicholas and Timmy have re-named them selfs Copin and Tornid. As a teacher's strike  keeps them from school they take a train without perrmison.  A  tunnel is the main mystery.  I recomend this book because it is not like a normal book since it has a tunnel instead of a house with a ghost. Eleanor estes is a  wonderful author. Read all of her books 
 Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon retells the matter of Britain from several feminine perspectives such as Igraine, Gwenhwyfar, and Viviane - but above all, Morgaine who is called le Fay, dedicated to the Goddess at a young age and heiress to all that is Her worship. The novel is often interpreted as Christianity versus paganism, which is an aspect of the story but not all of it. What Bradley explores is how Christianity and paganism exist side by side, how the Mists of Avalon are still there if only one can push them to one side to enter into the mystery beyond.  Bradley's elegantly evocative writing style, the glimpse of how it might have truly been create both a tantalizing and a soothing universe for the reader seeking to lose themselves to the fantasy. Bradley also does an excellent job creating a consistent world wherein mystery, love, tradition and religion intertwine the fates of so many.

 Keep in mind that this is an annotated bibliography.  That means Sontag's work is given precise descriptions, and the reviews and essays about her work are also summarized.  Even better, Poague has the single best  introduction to Sontag's career that is available.  It should be read in  conjunction with his introduction to CONVERSATIONS WITH SUSAN SONTAG.  I  can't think of a better way for anyone studying or writing about Sontag to  gain access to so much knowledge so quickly.  Certainly Poague's work  proved to be indispensable to my wife and me when we were writing our  biography of Sontag 
 I said in my review to "Fires at Midnight" that I consider both albums to be the best they have made so far. The similarity has been noticed by several reviewers; for some it is a weakness, some endorse enthusiastically. I follow the last trend.I have stopped long ago to always search for something "original", and the whole output by Blackmore's Night is an example of why. Once you find, either as a listener or a creative musician , your way to something well-done and enjoyable, simply continue and follow the paths tried and true.In fairness, this is what Ritchie Blackmore has always done, however he has decided to trun back to acoustic instruments.Ritchie Blackmore,long ago considered one of the best guitar players ever, is nevertheless one of the most traditional musicians ; not at all a revolutionary. He has always followed strictly J.S. Bach , Vivaldi, Paganini (technically speaking), and traditional European music, though most of his life he clothed it with hard riffs played loudly. When he made Blackmore's Night , along with his complement , Candace, he simply switched back to the same music closer to its original shape. By "Fires at Midnight" they had found a good formula for the music and message they wanted to deliver, so they simply followed along the same path. It is possible even that the songs in both albums may have been created close in time.Galician bagpiper wonderboy Carlos Nunez (if you haven't heard him .....start now)has said, "the successful experiment is the one that is firmply rooted in tradition", and the whole output of Blackmore's Night is an example of this.  Now the songs: the album opens with "Way to Mandalay", one of the best songs in Ritchie's lifetime, naturaly with gret lyrics by Candace.Haunting, hypnotic...and has a very good electric riff that fits perfectly the subject of the song."3 Black Crows" is a folksy song with lyrics funny at first, but that should linger in your memory so you may develop a simpler view of life.I went recently to Santiago de Compostela, and just before you reach the Cathedral there's a stone tunnel, and street musicians play there for nickels.This is the kind of music you hear there. When I play this at home or in my car they always ask me to play it again."Diamonds and Rust" is a successful cover, but although this is a great song that has been consistently well served by performers, I still think the best cover of this song is that by Judas Priest.Candace, however, finds her way through this battlehorse and gives us her interpretation convincingly in its straight-forwardness. "Cartouche" is another of their best songs.A fiery gipsy piece. "Queen for a day" follows the same musical trend, but the lyrics are a "fairy-tale" story that wouldn't sound out of place in an old Walt Disney movie."Ivory tower" again may be taken as a "fairy tale" song. Some may find it tiring ; I don't complain over beauty."Ghost of a Rose" is a beautiful love song, like Ritchie and Candace have made it a custom to treat us with. "Loreley" is an interesting song entirely on acoustic, traditional instruments , that tells one of several versions of a medieval German tale (the Loreley cliff actually exists in the Rive Rhine, and it's still a dangerous point along the river route). A good song to sing and dance along."Where are we going from here" is suitable for a cold winter night, or for those times in life when you seem to go nowhere. "Rainbow Blues" is a cover from an old Jethro Tull song, but as much as Ian Anderson is an excellent musician, who , like Ritchie Blackmore , combines strict Bach with some Bluesy flavour,this cover is in my opinion much better than the original. Another proof that Candace may build her own interpretation of a given song and share it more than convincingly.Some listeners by now feel there's just no variety, but that's just because an excelent song has been followed by another.....and another,and another. This is by no means a bad thing."All for one" is a great sing along with powerful beat, good Ritchie Blackmore riffs (suited for Candace's voice).....and "blowing" bagpipes to round up an already moving song. The album closes softly, like a gathering of old friends, with a song about friends long missed , joyfully met, and sorrily fared well in hope for a future "wieder-sehen". "Dandelion Wine" is a song you may play when you meet a life-long friend, and old love, or when you wish they all were here.All-accoustic, simple but effective instrumentation consisting of guitar, pipe (I can't tell if it's metal or reed)and tambourine.  As all other Blackmore's Night albums, this is not to be missed. And one you will always carry next to you.                          
 What can I say, I'm a Joanne Fluke junkie!  I love her Hannah Swensen series.  Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder I believe is one of the first.  They are all quick easy reads, and are suitable for teens and maybe some more intelligent pre-teens.  There is absolutely no foul language, and the romance thing between Mike and Norman is enough to keep everybody guessing and rooting for their favorite (mine is Norman)  If you like who-done-it's,want a light easy but riviting read, Joanne's Hannah Swensen's series are for you!  Perfect beach books, or being snowed in books.  Plus the recipes!  I've tried a couple from each book and they are wonderful.  Easy to follow and easy to make.  Although I have learned that you need to invest in a standing mixer to save your poor arms from falling off.  All in all you will not be wasting your money when you buy one of her books.  Thoroughly enjoyable, every one.  
 Peters is definitely one of my favorite authors. His insights on innovation offer me constant inspiration as I write my own newsletter - titled Byvation, which means ... By Way of Innovation.  In a dramatic opening, Tom Peters says it's all about "I-N-N-O-V-A-T-I-O-N." Peters is a legendary business guru for good reason, he tells it like it is. In "Circle of Innovation" Peters talks about how our world is now in a constant state of flux, and to prosper businesses must wake up and take action.  A very busy text, "The Circle of Innovation" contains hidden gems at every turn that may very well spell the difference between success and outright failure for your company.  Products and Services are quickly becoming commodities and being in a commodity business is a dangerous place to be. If you are to have any hope of success, you must offer a compelling reason for someone to do business with you and your company.  "The Circle of Innovation" offers tremendous insight on how to create compelling reasons for customers to do business with you. To keep us alert, limber, and ready for action, Peters provokes and cajoles his readers to THINK:  * We Are All Michelangelos: He shows how to transform every  jobholder" into a full-fledged businessperson.  * All Value Comes from the Professional Services: Because ... "It all boils down to the expertise of people, masses of them, booking, in some cases, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS in revenues."  * The System is the Solution: How to build great systems - which go far beyond nuts and bolts.  * Create Waves of Lust: Quality is no longer an automatic advantage.  * Little Things Are the Only Things. As the Blight of Sameness encroaches on market after market, design is often the best tool for sustainable differentiation.  All in all, a great book that will make you question much of what you do. In doing so, you will create a much more powerful and long-lasting company.  Michael Davis - Editor, Byvatio 
 What a pleasant surprise this album is -- right from the opening notes.  As an old-school Toto fanatic, I was pleased to hear so much of what made them incredible beginning some 25 years ago interwoven in this release.  Toto's musicianship relentlessly amazes as the band continues to progress and impress through time.  I'm not going to re-state what other reviewers have offered so eloquently, but this album is full of so many layers of "textured richness" that I have to add a few observations of my own.  "Falling in Between" opens the set with the kind of guitar-heavy force that "Carmen" did on Isolation...just reaches out and grabs you.  Also the Eastern influence is hauntingly delightful.  On "Dying on My Feet", the bridge hearkens back to "99" or the "Desert Theme" from the Dune soundtrack...smooth.  Joseph Williams' vocal contribution on "Bottom of Your Soul" makes a nice connection with The Seventh One.  I am not much of a softie for Toto ballads, but Steve Lukather's "Simple Life" is short and sweet -- and I think could probably have fit on any of the band's previous albums.  You can love or hate the VH underpinnings on "Taint the World", but man it's a fun ride, kind of like "All Us Boys" on Hydra.  When I first heard "Let it Go", I wondered if the band had been listening to "The Chick Corea Elektric Band" as their inspiration for that funky interlude section...sweet!  Of course the music is tight, top-notch quality, melodic, and produced as well as any previous Toto album.  Musically it's a standout because it combines the best of what the band did so well in the past with progressive directions that aren't totally out of character with their unique musical style.  I can't stop listening to it!  This album is probably the best 2006 music release you'll never hear on American radio -- satellite or otherwise -- and in my opinion the best I've heard in 2006 period 
 Well, I'm going to keep this short; I don't see any reason of boring you. I had high expectations for this book. I heard that it was one the best vampire books ever written, that it was scary, and so on and so forth. Anyway, this isn't scary at all, nor was it meant to be. Instead, this is a sympathetic view of vampires and shows how they live their lives. I have no problem with this, and applaud Rice for doing something original. I love the detail she puts into the scenery and makes the New Orleans of the past come to life with ease. Also, the character development of Louis is great, and the detail in other character (though coming from Louis's view point) is good. Unfortunately, the story suffers from Louis's narrative. He complains too much, continually debates if God and Devil are real or not, complains that he always wants to die but then admits every time he doesn't have the guts to do it. Really, if I wanted to listen to whining and complaining, I would listen to emo. Fortunately, this is a relatively short story; only about three-hundred and fifty pages or so. Another thing I like about this book is that it is a fast read. One could be done with it within a day to five days (just depends on how fast you read). All in all, this is a pretty good story. Not perfect, but definitely worth its price 
 "Second Chorus" is not a widely known film, but it will probably be enjoyable to any fan of Fred Astaire. If you're not particularly fond of Astaire, you might want to pass on this one since seeing Astaire in action in an unusual role is the main attraction. The story is that Danny O'Neill (Fred Astaire) and Hank Taylor (Burgess Meredith) are leaders of a band. The two have been intentionally failing in college, because they like the atmosphere, and also because as long as they are officially students they can spend their time running the band and making a pretty good living at it. When Ellen Miller (Paulette Goddard) enters the picture, they both get greedy and want her attention for themselves. Thus they each double-cross the other and both wind up getting expelled from the university, thus ending their cozy arrangement with their band. They spend most of the rest of the film continuing to double-cross one another, this time over trying to get into Artie Shaw's band as well as trying to win over the affections of Ellen, who now works for Shaw. In the end, Danny and Hank patch things up and decide to work together, with good results coming from their teamwork.  The things that are not so great about this film are mainly the quality of the video, the less than great comic timing, and the tiresome scenes with J. Lester Chisholm, played by Charles Butterworth. Mr. Butterworth is no Edward Everett Horton, and as a less-than-adequate character actor you just want to shoo the guy off stage every time he turns up. Also, if you're watching this film to see lots of Astaire's wonderful dancing, you'll likely be somewhat disappointed. He does do some singing and dancing, but this film mainly shows off his comic abilities, of which the mischievous Astaire has plenty. This part would have been better if the comic timing of the script had been tighter, though.  As for the second feature, "That's Dancing" is a documentary made in 1985 along the same lines of "That's Entertainment". However, in my humble opinion "That's Entertainment" did it before and did it better. Actually, this documentary seems a bit drawn out and lacks the excitement of its predecessor. However, you do get to see some good shots of Astaire and others doing some pretty impressive dancing. Considering the low cost of this double feature, for the ardent Astaire fan it is probably worth it 
 The book,To Be a Slave,is an awesome book.  It includes many letters, stories, biographies and autobiographies.  The genre of this book is historic fiction.  This book explains how it sounded to be a slave, what it looked like to be a salve, what it felt like to be a slave and what it was to be a slave.  The writings within the book were very detailed.   I thought this was a very strong book.  It had strong words and strong opinions in it.  It was a very enjoyable book.  I liked learning about how it was to be a slave.   I liked the stories that were told by the slaves.  I would recommend this book to 5th grade and older students.  It provides the reader with literature, english and alot of information about a very important topic in history - slavery 
 This book give precise and thoughtfull insites on both the technical and creative methods used to produce superior landscapes. There are numerous excellent examples. He does not get bogged down with technical trivia. I would definitly buy this book, it is a bargain. Its only shortcoming is not having a section on digital cameras that are taking over much of the market. These cameras allows instant feedback on photo results including histograms that remove all the guesswork and waiting to get film developed 
 Well I am a huge fan of the late 80s early 90s Seattle scene. I love everything from Green River to Pearl Jam to Nirvana to Mudhoney to Love Battery on and on. Well this demonstrates perfectly the Seattle sound. It features two of my favorite Pearl Jam songs that weren't released. It has Mother Love Bone. It really shows the music as it was. I advise you to pick this up 
 Although this book is officially about design, communication, and business information--for which it probably is only a mediocre, quasi-random collection of personal musings--I unexpectedly found this text to be a fabulous introduction to the postmodern mindset. It is a post-modern manifesto, of sorts, calling us to plunge into the new information age with courage,  creativity, and hope. It is "real-world" philosophy set in a business context. Wurman demonstrates that not only have times in fact changed, but we can change with them and even flourish. Rather than a threat to our old, familiar "modern" way of thinking, the new "Information Age" can be an exciting opportunity for creativity, relationship, and learning.  This book is an example of how we CAN get over our anxieties or doubts about postmodernism and start engaging the world and people around us in a more meaningful way.  And one more thing,... as a person working in Information Technology, I wish more people in IT would read this book. It could save us some grief in our deliverables and methodologies 
 This is a 2 CD retrospective on Joe Jackson 1979-2000 studio works (no live cuts). Rightfully so, it focuses on his more popular early work while just sampling his later more experimental works.  His earlier rock LPs were great cut for cut and the many cuts featured from these LPs bear this out. There's a few rarities included here  for the serious fans and the later cuts will give a flavor of those efforts while not getting into great depth. In his varied career, Jackson has had many highlights and this set does as good a job as possible of featuring his best 
 At first, I thought this book was going to be only for morbidly obese individuals. However, the more I read, the more I realized that this book doesn't exempt anyone. In one way or another, we all can improve our nutritional and physical habits. Susan tells a great deal of her life story in this book, but it illustrates her message. She doesn't omit the comprehensive knowledge she has on food, activity and its role in wellness. Her approach is sound. She doesn't recommend diets, fads or any other commercial remedies. Anyone can improve his or her life 
 This book is good as a reading book or as a quick reference for scholarly research in the area of LGBT studies.  I personally found Rowse's treatment of King James to be a good starting point for a paper I wrote on  homosexuality in Jacobean England 
 It took me awhile to get around to buying a Flash MX 2004 book.  But, when I finally decided on Flash MX 2004 Savvy by Watral and Herber, I was so happy.  The book is great.  Its not only really comprehensive, but it doesn't treat you like an idiot like some books.  I've got a fair amount of computer experience, but absolutley no Flash experience, and I was so pleased that this book  actually treated me like I knew somehting (just not about Flash).  I know it doesn't seem like much, but in today's market of hundreds and hundreds of Flash books, its the little things that count 
 I found it hard to put this book down. I purchased it in order to read "The Octopus" -  the only Frank Norris work I was aware of at the time. I found it extremely  difficult to put down. The writing was brilliant.  "The Octopus" depicts the dealings of the Southern Pacific railroad and the consequences of those dealings: lives ruins, families destroyed. There are subplots within the plot.  While the inhabitants of Nob Hill are planning to send a ship for fanmine releif a woman starves to death outside the mansions. This was very poignant. There are many such  moments in "The Octopus". At the end a kind of poetic justice was served to the agent of the railroad. Just when you think how dispicable the railroad is the conversation with the head of the railroad puts things in a different light.   The theme of "McTeague" is greed and what greed can drive people too: betrayal, murder, foresaking of family.  There is also the subplot of the courtship of the old couple which was very tender.   "Vandover and The Brute" is the portrayal of the downfall of one man. We read the descent from a life of privelege to the life on the bottom rungs of soceity.    All of the books are powerful and riveting. They made me want to read everything that Frank Norris wrote. 
 u dont need to listen to me so ill just say its agreat album with out any mistakes and probaly the best out of moe if u want great moe live try warts and all 
 Gibbon's "Decline and Fall" is without a doubt one of the most well-written and truly comprehensive historical works concerning the Roman Empire.  From the military maneuvers of the northern legions to the intrigues of the Imperial Court, Gibbon showcases the history of Rome as it unfolded--often relying on the eyewitness testimony of contemporary writers to give readers a sense of the passions and policies of the time.  There are a few minute problems--or rather gaps--in Gibbon's work, but given that he originally published in the late 1700's we can excuse his lack of complete information.  Overall, an excellent read and a great history of such an important subject 
 I have read all of Kathy's book they all tell you something.This was by no means my favorite.But there was good stuff in it.There are lot of material on this subject in print.I've read some of it.On a personal note I like a straight-forward murder any day.I hope she moves Tempe & Ryan's together for good they make an excellent couple.And tell us what Tempe status is with her marriage.I went to Montreal last summer and went to all places in the books. Great fun, very cool city 
 I really enjoyed this book enormously.  It does have echoes of Possession and I found myself more than once thinking of The Maltese Falcon.  Very well written, seamlessly changing from one historical period to the next and a wonderful ending.  I look forward to more work from Martin Davies 
 If not the best, certainly the most beautiful novel I've read so far this year, the most poetic and lyrical.  Doc Holliday was a tubercular gambler and gunman who ran around with a whore and lived a bloody life on several levels, including in his lungs.  That Bruce Olds could take such unpromising material and turn it into a work of art is an act of genius.  I don't even like "Westerns"--a friend recommended this book to me--but this is no "Western."  It is a poetic meditation on mortality and loss, love and sex, art and violence, and it sings and dances on every page.  It's less a story, than a symphony of language, and it works to perfection 
   I looked a long time for the 'best' book on lighting. I choose this text. It is 100% as promised in the promo. I knew nothing about the science of lighting when I began reading. When I closed the book, I was very well informed. I don't see how the data could have been better presented. EASY to apply! Excellent diagrams. I am using diagrams to think out my studio lighting setups. Will remain in my library as a reference.   A book BARGAIN 
 This is a great book. Unlike many other CISSP books, the book goes into details of each topic. For example, chapter 2 of the books provide great details on the Kerberos Protocol, and describes it better that any other CISSP book. The description was so good that it reminded of university days, when we had to learn various algorithm/protocols inside-out. I would recommend this book to anyone. http://validate.sf.ne 
 	In the John Grisham catalogue,  The Street Lawyer is viewed as one of his lesser works.  I am surprised as it impacts me the most, and recently discovered why. While watching Frequency with Dennis Quaid, I took note of the many possible plot holes that existed.  Yet when reading a review of the movie by film-critic Roger Ebert, I was struck that he left these "important" issues to the side and focused on the heart of the film, a father and son who almost supernaturally communicate across time to save the father's life and bring the two back together.  The film worked by keeping the father and son relationship in the forefront, thus allowing Ebert to remember his father.  The Street Lawyer works not only as a light reading page-turner but also as a novel that focuses on the homeless and successfully keeps them in the forefront of all action that goes on. 	Lawyer Michael Brock, owed to crisis, leaves his salary and future at a prestigious law firm to dedicate his talents to fighting for the rights of the homeless in Washington D.C.  Along the way we meet Claire Brock, who will go the way of failed first marriages, Ruby, a possible replacement, Mordecai, the larger than life lawyer for the homeless  who leads Michael's new thread bare law firm, and we get to know the homeless' plight through visits to D.C. shelters, conversations of poor municipal care, and a well-conceived plot involving an illegal ouster of rent-paying squatters that causes...well, I won't spoil it for the new reader.   	What is revealed, almost between the lines, is Grisham's friendliness towards religion.  The homeless are often fed by sympathetic churches, Ruby is the daughter of a minister, and the vice of greed is shown for what it is, a selfishness that hurts others and is often confused as a virtue ("Weren't we just chasing money? Why did we work so hard; to buy a richer rug, and older desk?").  Most telling is Brock's crisis experience.  When visiting the bodies of a homeless family in the morgue, we read, "I closed my eyes and said a short prayer of mercy and forgiveness.  Don't let it happen again, the Lord said to me." (pages 113-114 of the  1998 paperback edition) This line, that his new work is a calling from God, lifts the book to a new realm.  I recently talked to a lawyer friend of mine who teaches human rights, has participated in human rights conferences around the world, and has even counted votes with Jimmy Carter.  She said the non-religious approach to human rights holds that human rights and respect are essential to maintain world and regional harmony.  Yet this essential item is a construct rather than an absolute, and falls away if one does not agree that harmony is essential, that is, one might place a personal, political or religious viewpoint above harmony, making it his or her absolute, even if this involves killing.  Michael's calling is an absolute.  If God did indeed say it, then working to better the condition of the homeless results since people are made in His image, an absolute that would even cause Michael to leave it all and work for little to make their lives better.  That is not to say that the novel becomes "Christian", far from it.  But the biblical worldview is there, and this gives the book substance.   	The Street Lawyer does have weaknesses.  Its short chapters are designed to build sympathy for the homeless, while painting less than flattering pictures of those who should be doing more (i.e. anyone not homeless).   Michael's last chapter romance with Ruby almost seems tacked on, a sort of  "end with something upbeat here chapter", and certainly not all anti-homeless legislation is Republican.  As well, my father was a gruff, 20-year police veteran who detested, and I mean DETESTED, lawyers.   I don't think that Sgt. Gasko, when armed with a warrant to search Michael's apartment, would respond so previously to Michael's threats, but would have delighted in legally taking apart his apartment and enjoying a lawyer's ranting and raving at the same time.  I know my father would have loved that opportunity.  But the novel works by building on a biblical worldview where people do have merit, keeping the homeless the main thing, and giving me a hero whose exploits, no matter how fictional, awaken in me a desire to do something more for those whose voices society chooses not to hear.    
 The 1+2 punch from the spuds (the other being New Traditionalist)that went beyond the tyvek suit era.  A longtime fan from both ends of the spectrum, this is when they hit their stride.  The "Jocks/Preps" (wow!! how carbon dating is that) embraced "Whip It" 'cause they ate what was fed to them.  The rest of us bought it because we liked it.  For those of you who think the 80's are The Go-Go's, Haircut 100 & Spandau Ballet........well, I can't help out much 
 The item was very easy to assemble and it works well and certainly seems to do what it says. It is great 
 I'm typically a bit of an old guy when it comes to music.  I'll take Haggard over Chesney any day.  So I shouldn't technically be writing to support a group that is more pop than country, but I am.  I saw Restless Heart live recently, and their harmonies are the best in the business.  The cuts on this greatest hits collection tend to sound over-produced, because the harmony makes the music sound so BIG... but it sounds the same in person, and I find that remarkable.  These guys won my respect, and they're certainly responsible for some of the biggest crossover hits in the pre-Shania era.  It's just good music 
 I am a retired teacher who used this novel as a supplement when my classroom was learning about the Puritans' migration to early America.  The students loved the story and came away with a better understanding of the Puritan culture and problems they encountered in colonial America.  I now introduced my granddaughter to this novel as she is learning about religious groups who came to America to escape persecution in Europe.  She couldn't put the book down and was so excited about the novel that she encouraged her friends to read it.  I truly believe that literature provides a better understanding of history when it develops characters that represent the life and struggles of the times 
 This DVD contains four digitally remastered (great image quality) classic Dr. Seuss stories: * Green Eggs and Ham: about Sam-I-Am and his never ending quest to make people sample the dish he loves best. * The Sneetches: about a narrow-minded and prejudiced group of creatures who don't accept others who don't look exactly like them. * The Zax: about two hardheaded and proud beings who waste a whole lifetime for not yielding the right of way. * Grinch Night: about a courageous kid who faces the Grinch and saves his whole town from his malicious Halloween tricks and terrors. (A must see on Halloween night). It also contains two wonderful sing-along songs: He Will Eat Them and Grinches Inches Closer. Not only does this collection of cartoons contains the marvelous songs and poetry of Dr. Seuss, it is also a great way to teach kids about human values like open-mindedness, tolerance and acceptance, humility, courage and selflessness. They are filled with original art and are also very entertaining. Buy this DVD for your kids and enjoy it with them. I would also recommend buying Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat and Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas. --Reviewed by Maritza Volma 
 really fun. great game for on trips or at party 
 I enjoyed this novel. It wasn't Hiaasen's best work but it was well beyond a lot of novels one could read.   Hiaasen has the ability to look at the lower end of society and bring out the humour in how they conduct their lives. In this novel, two people win the Lotto. Ordinarily this would be a cause for celebration but when one of the winners bemoans the fact that they have to share their spoils with another and they are wanna-be white supremists, then the adventure starts.   The shenanigans of the characters is both humourous and engrossing, this is a book that I recommend 
 I could not put this book down until I finished it. It was so exciting and I felt so sorry for Rosamond as she tried to hide from her husband Tempest. Tempest kept me guessing trying to figure out who he really was because his hate and evil deeds to everyone made me assume he was Satan. I ached for Rosamond as she kept running away and I wished she could have led a happy life with the priest she met and fell in love with. I cried all the way through this book and haven't read anything so exciting and that held my attention so passionately. Wow! I wish every book could do that 
 If you're a fan of Godfrey Reggio and Ron Fricke's the Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqqatsi, Naqoyatsi trio or the even more narrative-driven Baraka (Fricke), this hugely innovative, groundbreaking film is a MUST-SEE.  You'll be amazed at the sort of filming and editing techniques these guys (and girl) employ during that period of time-- especially in comparison to what American cinema was like at the time 
 I actually enjoyed this much more than I expected to.  At one level. this is a 2-hour "what's wrong with this picture" game.  Much of the humor is a matter of out-of-place or quirky things that just show up on screen, often for reasons that have not much to do with the plot.  It isn't necessarily subtle humor, on the whole, but it isn't loud either; this isn't much like Airplane! in feel, despite some formal similarities.  So you have a female crew member who walks around the ship topless, with no one remarking on it (Airplane! would have 20 jokes about it).  You have a crew member who sings David Bowie songs in a samba style, in Portuguese.  The underwater creatures are CGI'd to quasi-cartoon effect.  And Bill Murray, just by being what you'd expect him to be (though not in the sense of being overly predictable), is often not what you'd expect a character like the one he plays to be.  He's a Jacques Cousteau who has a suspect knowledge of marine biology and wants to pursue a new species of shark out of revenge, to kill it.  Much the same point could be made by saying this is a parody of Cousteau, with a bit of James Bond and human interest thrown in, but it's the kind of parody, like Galaxy Quest, that's also a fairly earnest example of what it parodies, though never completely so.  It's this mixing of earnestness and off-kilterness that gives the movie its peculiar chemistry.  The characters are close enough to real that we care about them and their concerns, and enjoy the film as parody, human drama and adventure.  Low-key parody, human drama and adventure, for the most part.  There is attention to detail, plenty of odd or just right characterization, set decoration, and other points to hold interest.  It may have helped that I came to this film with low expectations.  It's the kind of oddity that leaves many people cold, as you can see from the reviews.  But it has its charm, more overtly funny than Lost in Translation and less offensive to your higher sensibilities than a typical Leslie Nielsen comedy.  I hope I haven't spoiled it for you by giving it a positive review, but I want to make it sound interesting enough to check out for yourself.  I know I'm going to want to see it again 
 Great phrases to facilitate choosing the "right" words to comment on the performance of employees and "just-in-time" help with important everyday management tasks for anyone and everyone who needs to communicate in today's business world 
 I read this book this year, when my mom sent me a box of books to camp over the summer.  All the rest were Dear Americas so this was the first one I picked up.  Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  I read during softball and got hit on the head.  I read during dinner and stained my favortie shirt.  I tried to read dujring instructional swim but my counselor took the book away from me.  I read under the covers and I got into trouble when my division head came in.  I finished it in under eight hours.  It's the best non-Dear America book I've ever read.  It tells a  very interesting story, full of humor and wit.  Jean Fritz is an incredibly talented writer, who managed to cover two years time in an average-sized book.  Each chapter is a story all its own and also funny.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a really good historical fiction/nonfiction story 
 I use this DVD series to help teach evolution to my high school biology students.  They love it, I love it, and it's very easy for them to understand.  The bonus is that it's current and is as correct a video I have seen.  Absolutely awesome.  When teaching evolution, it can sometimes be 'dry' for the students and this video series brings it to life.  The graphics and computer generated images really keep the students' attention.  The best part is that is correlates with the website.  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/  
 I enjoyed the story. I little peek into a time a past.  
 I just love Nora Roberts, but I have to say she has truly outdone herself with the latest The Circle Trilogy. They are hard to put down. Great reading 
 Its a pretty good CD. But I have to agree that they should have Ice Cube in this CD 
 The US of Arugula closely follows the trajectory of our appreciation for fine food and its makers over the last 50 + years.  The author's breadth of knowledge and understanding of these food workers who now have become like unto rock stars is nicely understated.  To think: a hundred years ago, a cook was just a common household servant, or a member of the working class.  Before Henri Soule, Julia Child, Alice Waters or Jeremiah Tower, one really wouldn't much consider even conversing with a chef. Now cooks are heralded like sports stars, rock stars & opera divas.    Kamp's history of this progression, and the food which accompanies these personalities is bright and treated with just the right amount of salt. Being from Berkeley I've known some of these miscreants from Chez Panisse - and a wonderful, creative lot they are.  It is fortunate to see how much the goals of these Berkeley rebels permeates current food thinking.   Kamp's writing style is both personal and objective.  I only wish there were more chapters - like one on the Hawaiian fusion cuisine movement, or more on France's nouvelle cuisine, which I always attributed to the huge influx of Vietnamese cooks who came to France during & after the fall of Saigon & whose vegetable based cuisine much influenced their French bosses.    My only question to Kamp now would be: "So what will you be eating tonight?"  Probably something pretty tasty!  This book is not only the perfect bed side companion on a cold night, but a great one to take on a vacation.  Very well written, and very easy to read.  I recommend it to all 
 This book seemed more aimed toward a boyfriend girlfriend scenario than a married couple like myself. I like Dr. Laura on the radio and her book is well written, but did not appeared to be aimed at me 
 Another of the finest long-form Seuess books, THE KINGS STILTS joins BARTHOLOMEW AND THE OOBLECK, HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS and both of the Horton the Elephant books as his finest works for new readers 
 I really love Bones.  It has everything: suspense, drama, humor, pretty people, fun storylines.  I have yet to miss an episode, and even into Season 2 this is probably my favorite.  It adds depth to all of the characters.  Also, the winter holidays are my favorite time of year.  I like holidays that are about what is good in the world.  Bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day.  I cry through half this episode, but in a completely good way.  Buy, watch it, love it.  But watch it with a friend if you don't want to cry alone.  So moving, great performances by the whole cast.  Emily Deschanel was powerful in this one, she brings real vulnerability to Brennan here.  David Boreanaz, as always the perfect sympathetic hero, loveably old-fashioned. Cute, funny moments.  Touching, poignant moments.  This really is the best of what is great about Bones 
 As always, South Park rules; but why since Season 4 no subtitles are available? This would really help those of us who don't speak or understand English so well 
 i was frustated,depressed and lost interest in life.fortunately my friend handed over me this book called "Tough Times Never Last, but Tough People Do!".it was like energizer,life giving to me.  i am proud to  say that my way of living,my way of thinking,my attitude has completely  changed.now i dont get depressed.i am always in best spirits.thanks to  sir.Robert Harold Schuller who has helped me change my life completely,i  have encouraged my friends to go thru the wonderful book and change their  way of living,thinking 
 if you are a SG Fan you must own this DVD Just like the first DVD theres lots of interviews and extra cool stuff Manko also narrates it so it has to be awesome 
 That Ms.Drinkwater's 'The Olive Farm' made me immediately want to pack and fly to see the verdant countryside she described, I never believed for a moment that a sequel could be so much more engrossing and personal.'The Olive Season' is  filled with the stories of visitors to the farm, together with the difficulties of bringing the olives to fruit, but it is her baring her soul in dealing with the trauma of a personal tragedy that tears ones heart out. She must be a fighter for she went on with her life and her farm, and in the end one knows she will come out on top. A joy to read and to re-read 
 I think I found answers to all I've ever wanted to know about the Roman Empire. This book is certainly readable by anyone. If you don't like reading long texts, this book is perfect. If you do like longer texts, this book is also nice. The balance between pictures and texts is optimal in my opinion 
 I had bought this album a long time ago as a vinyl record. I loved it then. It was my very favorite Christmas album. Then my turntable broke. So I got the CD for Christmas 2006. John's voice is just as beautiful as I remembered. So clear, so haunting. All of the songs are so lovely, even the silly "Please, Daddy Don't Get Drunk This Christmas". But my very favorite song is "Christmas For Cowboys". When you listen to the words, you can visualize John riding his horse looking up at the stars on a crisp cold Christmas night.  This truely is wonderful Christmas gift everyone should get for themselves. 
 Ayn Rand was born and raised in the Soviet Union at the height of Communism's influence there.  She moved to the United States around the age of 20 and embraced American ideals in a way that is made easier and more whole by having experienced the opposite and seeing how horrible it is.  Rand lays out in The Fountainhead the idea that human acheivment is, in and of itself, a wonderful thing.  When people love their work, produce something of value, and profit by that endeavor, the highest human ideal is reached.  For Rand, altruism and the false ideal of selflessness are the greatest evils in our world, made dangerous by the ease with which they can be made to sound wonderful and undercut the engine that drives mankind forward - man's selfish desires.  In The Fountainhead, Rand lays out a stylized story of a New York in which alruism has become the central philosophy of the people.  One man, an architect, refuses to live according to the prevailing ideas of the times, doing his own work in his own way.  The novel follows this architect as he comes up against a progression of figures more and more central to mental disease that is eroding New York.  Rand's writing is odd and stilted, but her philosophy is so important and compelling that you become wholly invested in the characters specifically because they are an embodiment of an ideal.  Rand's ideas aren't popular in the United States right now.  In an era where we think of Enron and Tyco as representative corporations and speak the words "big business" with no question as to the assumed and implied idea that they indicate something undesirable, Rand's ideas are more important than ever.  We need the jobs, the advances, the wealth and the innovation that are produced almost exclusively through the acheivement of self-motivated individuals.  We can lose them if we forget the lessons taught by Rand and by history.  A huge book with huge ideas.  Highly recommended 
 My family and I have used this excellent guidebook extensively in our travels throughout Maine.  The information is extensive and helpful.  Don't travel in Maine without it 
 I really enjoyed this book.  This book is written to  keep your interest.  It keeps you hoping for a happy ending, but still satisfies you despite the not so happy ending 
 I've been doing this DVD workout for two years, and I still can't make it all the way through the "level 2" workouts.  This video is incredibly challenging, but I like that I can do the "level 1" workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day.  No other DVD can accomplish what Tamilee does in 15 minutes.  This really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time.  I am always sore the next day when I do her workouts.  This is a great DVD 
 My son received these blocks as a first b-day gift and they have been a favorite of his and any kid who enters our home. They are extremely durable(they hold up to standing on them)and can be used to create all sorts of things. My 4 year old is constantly creating "castles" and "houses" for her dolls and stuffed animals. My 22 month old delights in knocking them over and is now starting to stack them on his own. We make a game out of putting them away in the clear bag they came in. We store them behind a chair in our living room and almost daily my son climbs on the chair and looks over and points that he wants to play with them. I highly recommend this toy for children 18mos - 6 years 
 This fast paced 256-page narrative tells a colorful tale of how the author trained his dog sledding team in northern Minnesota and then completed his first 1180-plus mile Iditarod sled race across Alaska.  The injury-plagued agony of training the near-wild dogs in Minnesota is daunting in itself, but the hazards of the Iditarod trail - moose attacks,  falling down canyon walls, blizzards, 60-degree below zero cold, thin sea ice, injuries, hallucinating fatigue - blend together into what most people would find almost incomprehensible agony.  And far from "placing" in the race the author is far back in the pack where simply completing the event is an accomplishment few people will ever know.  The story centers on Paulsen's fifteen dogs; their personalities, habits, behavior and, above all, their apparent passion for pulling the sled and driver without complaint.  In fact, on numerous occasions they simply can't be stopped.  And their instinctive violent aggressiveness toward most every living creature they encounter, including the sled drivers, is daunting.  Recommended for anyone who wants a participant's view of a epic subzero adventure with a pack of semi-wild dogs in a frozen wasteland, but prefers the vicarious experience of reading about it while snug in a comfortable chair.  There's a sketch map to help follow the action.  And there are 20 photos of the terrain in Alaska, life on the trail and the author's dog teams (although, oddly, no picture of his favorite dog, Cookie) 
 If you have seen Keller Williams live, you probably loved him or hated him right away.  I fell into the prior group and have been following him steady for about two years now.  This new double live cd, stage, is the best representation to date of his live shows.  Loop, another live cd released in 2001, was also a very good disc which I highly recommend to anyone, and Stage carries the torch of this album by reflecting his more recent escapades on stage.  There are more instruments used on this album (read my loop review for more info on his one man band angle) to create a much more complete sound.  Some of the cover songs on stage will make you laugh out loud or at the very least guffaw slightly.  I especially enjoyed his version of rapper's delight, which I saw him perform live and is barely recognizable from the original.  All in all, this is a great cd if you are into improvisational live music and, as i've said before, if you can't see him live, this is the next best thing (but not nearly as good as in person, check him live! 
 I read this book out of curiosity right after I read J. Michael Bailey's landmark scholarly study, The Man Who Would be Queen.  I find McCloskey's memoir to be complementary and reinforcing---wonderfully well written, insightful, humourous, and honest. McCloskey is a consummate scholar, a dispassionate writer, and an astute observer of human behavior.  I recommend this book to one and all readers.  Kudos! 
 I've loved the "Art of Star Wars" books since childhood, but the Revenge of the Sith book stands above all the others. The paintings and sketches make me wish The Saga could continue indefinately! Aliens, monsters, battleships, fighters, Jedi Knights, droids, pilots, politicians and damsels are covered in great detail. The colors are suberb. The sculptures and models highlight everything, portraying how much effort went into these films. 
 This book is really a "laugh-out-loud" and, a quick read novel.  It relates to real life and real situations in a "easily read" format.  A joy to read and a "hate-to-finish" from beginning to end 
 An easy read and a book that truly draws your interest to product searching for antiques.  Lynn draws on family experience honed from many years with her grandmother who was an expert on antiques.  I highly recommend this book for anyone hoping to expand their knowledge in this genre 
 Having just finished listening to all 5 discs comprising the audio CD version of this book, I am convinced that those reviewers who are so vehemently condemning the book must not have actually read it.  Did they not notice that the author spends fully HALF THE BOOK exhorting the reader to acts of Christian kindness and charity and cautioning against falling into the trap of selfishness and narcissism?  And what on earth is wrong with attaining a positive self-image and viewing ourselves the way God does?  What on earth could possibly be wrong with claiming in faith the blessings and restorative power of the Holy Spirit in times of financial adversity??  I think this is a great book, an eloquent reminder of the reality of who we are in relation to God.  That so many guilt freaks would see fit to condemn the book is utterly dismaying to me.  I suggest you buy it, read/listen, and decide for yourself.  But you have to get through the whole thing, people 
 With the powers and spirits of the earth all around us Cunningham shows us how to bring this energy into our every day lives.  You can use these spells as a base to build other more complex spells.  They are also easy to use in circles and out of them as well.  A must have to add to the first.  With more elements than the first book you dive deeper than before into a magickal life 
 The camera bag is excellent. This is a great deal for getting the extra battery you need as a backup for your camera with a well constructed camera bag and UV filter 
 Amazon is so quick and easy and it was really helpful to get the book within the same week I ordered the book. They really took the stress out of "when am I going to get my book, am I going to get it in time for class? 
 Excellent primer about this modern conflict minus the spin, controversy, and commercial interruptions...  1. John Keegan is without a doubt, one of the most highly respected military historians alive. If you're not familiar with his work, I'd highly recommend The Mask of Command (Alexander the Great, U.S Grant, Wellington, Hitler) and The Face of the Battle. (Waterloo, Somme, Agincourt)   2. In The Iraq War, a short book and quick read, he starts with a brief history of Iraq, the rise of Saddam, the first Gulf War, and the most recent conflict. He ends with a postscript that details event in Iraq as recently as October 2004.   A few points:  In the minds of many, the decision to go to war, the actual conflict, and the handling of recent events is politically charged, controversial, and even questionable in terms of the legitimate use of force. Regardless of your position, this book is a good informative read. Keegan skirts almost all controversy to describe the motives to go war and the execution of the conflict with complete clarity. It's a quick read. He takes you from the allied forces crossing the Kuwait border to the fall of Baghdad in about 40 pages.    The brief section regarding Saddam's rise to power is fascinating. Appendix 2, which is a summation of his discussion with General Franks is also interesting and well organized: esp. Frank's description of the five fronts in Iraq and the use of deceptive operations.   Hardcore fans of Keegan will no doubt be disappointed. (This is the historian with the ability to take you into the minds of Alexander the Great, Wellington, and Adolph Hitler with ease; and describe their campaigns with the same effortless and highly readable prose.   You have to take this book for what it is: a brief expose on the current conflict. Also, towards the end of the book, Keegan even states that not enough time has passed to give the conflict true historical perspective.   If the only thing you know about the Iraq War, Saddam, and the history of Iraq is limited to television news coverage, I'd highly recommend this book 
 Marlie Montague is a comic book writer and conspiracy theory enthusiast with a distrust of the government and the military. When she was a child, her navy hero father was accused of being a traitor, but was killed and tossed overboard.   Joel Hunter is a former SEAL now working for the NCIS. His latest assignment is to watch over Marlie, as she is suspected of subversive activities. But as far as Joel can tell, she is a friendless shut in who's only excitement is a weekly bowling game. When she shows up on his doorstep proclaiming that the UPS man tried to kill her, he helps investigate (knowing he has her under video surveillance). When no sign of an intruder is present, and the cops assume she is a fruitcake, Joel checks the video footage, only to discover that it's been erased.   When her mother disappears, Joel offers to help her look. And soon he discovers that at times of stress, she adopts the aggressive attitude of her kick-butt comic book heroine Angelina. They prove to be irresistible to each other, and engage in a rollicking affair while solving the big mystery. What will happen when Marlie discovers Joel's duplicity?  Chock full of action, plot twists, snappy dialogue, and double crosses, Joel and Marlie take plenty of time to explore their sensual sides. The most humorous and memorable of Wilde's stories to date 
 This is a book of many parts.  A daughter's memoir of extraordinary parents it is, which was what I expected.  And indeed that is the organizing thread. But it also offers delicious insights into the Conde Nast publishing empire.  It's about fleeing France in 1940 - about fleeing the Russian revolution in 1920 - about the emigre experience - about arrogance, pride, generousity,selfishness and monumental ego. It's about Paris between the wars and America during and after WWII.  A story beautifully written, lovingly told - and I honestly couldn't put it down 
 Knowing that this reviewer's view of this internationally popular favorite of every concertgoer is that of a curmudgeon, this recording is as acceptable as any of the ones available. Herbert von Karajan is at the helm of the trusty Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the Vienna Singverein, and a cast of soloists that are the envy of any conductor - Gundula Janowitz, Hilde Rossel-Majdan, Waldemar Kmentt and Walter Berry, stalwarts all and obviously veteran performers of this regularly programmed piece.  The interpretation is brisk and lively and yet lingers over the inner two movements that gives some solace between the sandwich ends of the first and fourth movements.  It is a fine recording.  For this listener this is Beethoven's least impressive symphony.  While there are moments in the 'Adagio molto e cantabile' that justify the Elysium reference in the final movement, and yes, there are interesting inner fugues and some lovely solo lines for paired celli and double basses, the popularity of the piece seems to be the much recorded last movement 'An die Freude'.  It is big, loud, long, and uses massive forces and it does gratefully terminate a 70 minute piece.  Heresy? Yes, for most listeners these words are scandalous.  But just getting trough the first movement's wandering ideas and then waiting for the climax can be wearing.  Does anyone else agree?  Probably not.  But if you must your own #9, this recording is as fine as they come.  Grady Harp, May 06 
 All of the books in this series are great. J.D. Robb blends mystery, romance(parts of which are pretty steamy) , drama and comedy all in riveting, page-turning books. In fact, I find myself reading some of these so quickly because of the excitement of the plot, that I sometimes have to go back and reread sections where certain characters first are mentioned so I can figure out who they are when they enter into the picture later in the book. I have 3 friends who are also reading the "Dallas/Roarke books, who come back right after they have finished one to get the next one from my "Library". I now have the first 15 in the series and have just ordered the next 4.  Dawn W. , Vonore, T 
 I checked this book out of the library for my five-year old, and she loved it. She got really excited about this book and seemed to love how the pictures illustrated the text. There was this one particular set of pictures that referred to PROTEIN. The first picture showed a girl on the farm doing chores and talking about how protein helps you be stronger. In the background, there were the meat sources of protein: a cow, a lamb, a chicken, etc. On the next page, a couple of kids were next to a beanstalk, talking about other sources of protein--like beans. The pictures were very colorful and eye-pleasing and I loved how the author used word bubbles from the kids in the book to explain--in simple language and with everyday examples, what each nutritional component does for the body. She let the characters teach. In one part of the book, they put on costumes to show which vitamins do what! This book made it really easy for me to discuss the importance of eating right to my child, and--after six months--she still remembers things like, "eggs have protein in them and protein makes you strong!" [her words] There are simple recipes in the back, which we didn't test, but I look forward to trying them out once we get the book again. The only things about this book I didn't like was the lack of scientific activities, but I'm looking into other titles to supplement (like, Janice VanCleave), and a lack of "discussion starters". Otherwise, I think this book is a wonderful way to start your own discussions on healthy eating. One of the great things about smaller children is their need for repetition, so I'll get the chance to come up with a new discussion every time we read this book 
 Quem não gosta de samba, bom sujeito não é, é ruim da cabeça ou doente do pé...essa letra desse samba serve para definir melhor o cd da marisa monte. Quem não gostar dele, é doente da cabeça, do ouvido, do corpo, etc. É um trabalho dedicado, na medida certa para esta cantora, verdadeira diva da mpb. Recomendo a todos. 
 For me, this film was about Matt Damon, a brilliant newcomer who came out of (seemingly) nowhere. I was floored by his performance - one of the best of the 20th century. Of course he was supported by a fine cast -  Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and the loveable Minnie Driver, whose onscreen chemistry with Damon was sizzling. Matt is an emerald in a heap of cheap diamonds, and obviously a multi-talented guy - he co-wrote the screenplay as well as starred in it. Well worth seeing.  
 Picked up Knitting For Dogs last night and looked through the patterns. It is a fun book with different yarns suggested for the sweaters. Yes, most of the yarns come from a yarn store but in such small amounts the sweaters wouldn't be costly to make. There are very sweet designs for  girl dogs and some "manly" type sweaters for boy dogs. Most patterns are simple but there is a Fair Isle design  and  a sweater with a cable stitch. Great way to learn these designs since the projects are small.   I like the fact that different type yarns are used. Who wants to knit with boring old worsted all the time.  If you have creativity in your soul, this book is for you. If you want your dog to stand out because of a creative, classy sweater than go for this book.   And to top if off, the models are great!  :)  
 In this case, everyone is right, this is an amazing book.  I used it in conjunction with my required textbook for an undergraduate diff eq course.  This book was far superior.  Who would think a subject like this could be made so accessible?  Like others, comparing this 'dinosaur' to current text makes me wonder at the declining level of quality in our education system. Or maybe this book is just that good 
 A MUST READ!! DRAWS  AND CAPTURES READER INTO 17TH CENTURY FRANCE.  DRAMATIC PAGE TURNER. MOVING BEGINNING AND GREAT ENDING. DID NOT WANT THIS BOOK TO END.  SHOULD BE MADE INTO A MOVIE. I WILL BE READING ALL OF MS. HARRIS' OTHER BOOKS, ASAP. 
 This review applies to Small Corner of Hell and Putin's Russia. I read almost all of Anna's books and reports for Novaya Gazeta. It always struck me how dedicated and fearless (sadly she paid the ultimate price) she was to helping regular civilians living in Chechnya, and not just Chechens but Russians too. Her critics acuse her of being pro-chechen, but she also did plenty of reporting about Russian families who got stuck in the basements of Grozny during Russian carpet bombing campaign and for whom nobody in Russia really cared. She also wrote about regular Russian soldiers who are basically used as modern day slaves (Russian army is not voluntary).  If you are a Western reader trying to understand the roots of this conflict, Politkovskaya's books are probably a wrong choice. For that you have to read some history books addressing Russian history of the last 200 - 300 years. Start with Richard Pipes or something similar. Her books are reports of what's going on there now. As such they are great examples of what the REAL journalism should be. They also serve as a good source on what's really going on in Russia today. They would make a good foundation for a War Crimes Tribunal for both Russian and Chechen sides (or are they really just the same Gang), which hopefully will take place some day.  Finally, as others pointed out here the Publisher Weekly reviewer frankly does not know what he is talking about. He probably thinks Kim Jon Il is a legitimate ruler because 98% of North Koreans "vote" for him, too 
 I used this map for 2 internships in DC. Its great 
 I think these are the best looking speakers out there. The coolest part may be the blue lights underneath the left and right speakers. They really do look like spaceships. The sound is fantastic, especially considering the small size of the whole system. The subwoofer is not as large and bulky as other systems in this price range and it's probably the only subwoofer you wouldn't want to hide anyway - cause it looks cool! Would have been even better if it too had blue lights. The only downside I can think of is that there's only one input jack. So you can't hook up multiple sources directly to the system. I've tried mini-phone Y adaptors but the sound becomes distorted 
 I purchased this for my son who is in is second year of teaching 8th grade.  He found it very informative. 
 This book HAD to be written for my daughter & me!!  My daughter had started reading it & was not even past the 2nd chapter when she was yelling, "MOM!! YOU JUST HAVE TO READ THIS!!" Ohmigod, It is DEAD ON our relationship. Unlike some books that before you finished it, would have you seeking professional help, this makes me feel WONDERFUL that we are obviously not the only ones with all these same feelings and interactions. How comforting in itself! I absolutely love this book so far & am looking forward to reading the rest of it. HIGHLY recommended :) Thanks for writing such a good one.  Beverly (& Jennifer) Armstron 
 A fun book that might open your eyes to things usually taken for granted.  My copy of the book was actually bound with the spine on the opposite side of the book which was a bit awkward but was a lesson in the spirit of the  book.  (I have never seen another copy bound the same way, so it might have  been an accident.) I return to the book whenever I think I am stuck in  habitual thinking about objects and processes 
 This book has everything....Love, Greed, Murder.  What more can you ask for?  This book was one of the first romance novels I ever read, and I still have my original copy, that belonged to my mother.  I love to read it over and over again.  Luke and Roxy are two of my favorite characters.  Usually, the background characters tend to fade, but those in this book, Max, Mouse, Lily, and even Mike the dog are all memorable.  
 I have all of the cds that they have done, and this is the best one out of the lot. Jump blues the way it should be played.  They are still new to the publicity at this point and they are just out there having fun and it shows, you cant help but tap your foot when this cd is on 
 What an insight on the humans will to survive. Also a good look at how we cast out those who don't agree with our opinions. This book is a must read especially for children. Although the story can sometimes be scary, it is important for children to know some of the things presented in this story. As for the adults, it is a great story to take yourself back in time with. To be a child again in this life is always welcome and this story pulls it off very well 
 I am a physician (MD type) and find myself turning to this book often.  It does a good job of teaching patients about the medical problems at hand (sometimes quite thoroughly), and presents well-researched potential solutions to their problems.  My only complaint - where's a new edition (this one dates back to late 90's!) 
 It's not the best looking remote you'll ever find but the design is made practical to fit the strap. You'll never lose this remote and it works like a charm 
 This is a great read, organized in the way one wants biographies to be organized.  Its format is superlative.  There is chronology in the front to guide one to the life, and the footnotes are where they belong--on the bottom of the page, so one does not have to go to the back of the book, only to find that footnote is just a page citation.  Remini makes Webster's famous orations come alive, and I thrilled anew to words long famous, expertly guided by the author of this fantastically good biography 
 The story was a little bit too heavy on revenge than on romance but Philips' arrival just brightened the pages. Although Adriane's mother's story was interesting, still it felt too long.  Adriane and philips were so good together. Both of them understood each other completely and they shared similar interests like they loved to steal,:-).I loved the crack that Philips made about two theives celebrating their wedding night by stealing a masterpiece. I just loved Philips.Although it was essentially Adriane's story but still Philips most definately made the story fun.  
 The first time I ever saw Marvin Sapp was at my church in Dallas at the Potters House. He was teaching during a Wednesday night bible study and sharing his testimony. I think it was right before his album "I Believe" was released. I remember him singing a few songs from that album, and there is something about his voices that rings the sound of a true Worshipper. No matter how good a gospel singer sounds there is just something different about a person who is anointed to sing and who has a testimony attached to every note. I just purchased the CD entitled "Diary of a Psalmist," and the track "You Are God Alone" is just so Awesome!!! Even if you don't know how to worship God this song will bring you to your knees and you will suddenly find yourself in the presence of an Awesome God!!! And the words to the song simply speaks well of God-such Praise and Adoration!  God Bless you Marvin for allowing God to use your gifting and your voice to bless the world and the nations. I pray that God's hand would continue to be upon you and your family. Keep on growing strong in the Lord!! God Bles 
 I bought this for my wife, who grew up listening to this style. I myself wouldn't have touched it back in the 80s and early 90s, but this record rings true. The recordings are tight with reflections of the last time before the electronic music movement where albums got listened to and musicians practiced to attain technical perfection. I am a bit of a grunge musician myself, but this record made me remember a time where musicians had something to say and the musical expertise to say it. This record is a great anthology of the post-Zeppelin, pre-Nirvana ride I call Rock and Roll 
 Billy Collins Live is great! The introduction by Bill Murray is the perfect touch.  Hearing Collins reading his own poetry is superb.  He, of course, makes the right pauses at all the right places keeping his listening audience hanging on his every word.  His dry wit along with his perfect reading style makes for a very enjoyable and entertaining audio CD 
 'Fat Land' by Greg Critser is a heavily researched analysis of why Americans are and how they became they fattest people on the planet.  It's a unbiased look at how said people got to where they are today, what conditions are in place to produce such an obese nation, and what we can do to try and overcome the biggest health problem this country has ever seen.  The thing that struck me the most about 'Fat Land' is how extensive and relatively NEW this epidemic is in this country.  I knew before reading this book that there were a lot of fat people in the United States but I wouldn't have guessed that the #s were as high as they are.  In the year 1970 and beforehand the levels of obesity were nowhere near what they are today, so why has the problem spread like a foul disease (of course that's exactly what obesity is, a disease)??  Fast Food and cheaper, more accessible fast food.  Back 35 years ago the fast food landscape just wasn't what it is today.  One was not able to insert the key into the ignition of their car and within 5 minutes they would be bombarded by signs of McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Kentucky Friend Chicken.  Back 35 years ago there were probably only a select few   brands of sodas available and they were relatively much more expensive back then.  Even with Coke and Pepsi as the primary choices, if you turned the label you would still find 'Sugar' as its key ingredient, but you wouldn't see High Fructose Corn Syrup as the main producer of this sugar, and due to this use of the unprocessed sugar that we have today, your pop wouldn't taste nearly as sweet as the Frankensugar sodas that make up entire aisles in supermarkets today.  After reading 'Fat Land' it became easy to understand that obesity more than anything else is an issue of class.  Bombarded by cheap food at cheap prices, the poor use their limited funds to buy the only thing they can really afford, and they pay the price.  Without having the financial means to buy better quality sources of energy, the lower class open their wallets and use that buying power to the limit.  Super size me???  Of course I'll super size, for 30 cents more I get more fries and more soda and that can only equate to more pleasure!!  Right??  Wrong.  Dead wrong.  The obesity epidemic in this country gets worse every passing year, and as more fast food options become available with even shorter commutes, the problem isn't going to get better any time soon.  With the class gap widening with each passing year this only exemplifies the problem at hand.  The poor get even poorer and they have to expend even less effort to get the fast food that gives them the little enjoyment in their lives.  It's a truly vicious cycle that needs to stop as soon as possible.  Not only is it costing thousands of lives every year, it's costing every person that has health insurance thousands of dollars more taking care of all these fat people.  Only through education and personal willpower/restraint can the obesity problem in the United States be controlled.  It's a long, hard journey that features regular citizens against the mega corporations that have a tighter control of this land with every passing day.  If we don't do something fast we're all in big trouble.  And I mean BIG.  ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDE 
 It's been a while since I've had to write in Philosophy-Speak...I think I've forgotten how.  But let me speak plainly.  This is one of the few philosophical treatises that I've actually read cover-to-cover.  Kierkegaard is, by far, my favorite philosopher, and I tend to agree with most of what he has to say.  As a religious person, I agree with what he has to say.  The main proposition of this book is: Sin IS Anxiety, and the opposite of Anxiety (Sin) is Faith.  As an existentialist, we are all radically free (I know, Sartre's phrase) so when we despair (The Sickness Unto Death) we actually CHOOSE to feel that way.  Once we accept this, we can achieve serenity through Faith in God 
 I liked this book so much that when I found out I was not going to be an English teacher anymore and was going to teach math, I still kept the book because it looked like fun to me!  The pages are easy to understand and they have a lot of information in fun ways of learning.  I think that students would really enjoy this format for learning English 
 This is Andy Statman's new CD that presents Instrumental interpretations of  Niggunim of  the Habad Hasidic movement. Andy uses either a trio or quartet here.  On a majority of the material plays clarinet and a few of the latter cuts he plays mandolin. There is a very powefull emotion in Andy's clairinet playing and of course he is technically excellent. This CD has the same power as his last two CDs.  I wish he would have stretched out more on some of the material as he is an exellent inproviser.  Most importantly, I am very grateful that Andy has contributed his immense talent and creativity to the world of Jewish music. This is very spiritual moving music. Get this CD and be inspired.             
 This book is a masterpiece of literature.  If you haven't yet read it, you must. It's like a Don Quixote story of the twentieth century, but much better 
 I am a huge Dummies fan. So when I recently decided to learn more about baseball, I naturally turned to the Dummies guide. What I found was a book that, true to its name, does help a person who knows absolutely nothing about baseball. If you knew nothing about baseball, you could pick up this guide and read the first 3 chapters, and become conversant.  It also has a good deal of detailed information for those who play and want to improve their game. Strategy on hitting, pitching, running, and just about everything else about baseball is presented. This is also good stuff.  So aside from a minor though annoying problem in this book - which I will note in a moment - this is an all-around great book. Joe Morgan, hall-of-fame second baseman, and a cast of other well-known major leaguers contributing bits on their own positions make this book an excellent reference on baseball.  My problem with the book is that this book is difficult for me as a person in the middle ground of those who grew up around baseball, playing it occasionally but not seriously, and never having a deep knowledge of the game. For example, he starts using the player numbering system used on scorecards early in the book, but does not explain it until chapter 18. I have found this kind of problem several times in this book. In fact, it's not so much a matter of the information being lacking - it just seems not well organized or indexed.  But this is a relatively minor point. Get this book if you really want to know baseball 
 This CD is the apex of the broiling fusion scene in 1970's. One of the most imagininative, compelling groups EVER. And THIS IS THEIR BEST ALBUM BY FAR!!!!I saw these guys live at "My Father's Place" on Long Island in 1980. Jon Clark replaced Holdsworth for the tour, but it hardly mattered (I WAS initially dissapointed of course). This collection of tunes is listenable, exciting rock/jazz. It has part of it's genesis in albums like Yes' "Close To The Edge". Momentous. Just as the Beatles dragged their version of Chuck Berry across the Atlantic, Bruford's absolute love of the smokin' Blue Note albums from late 50's and early 60's is the origin of this fine collection of tunes. Nothing better, I don't care what you say; by this point in history of Prog, they were ALL chasing Allan Holdsworth and Bill Bruford. They still are! Drink right from the source! Ahhhhhhhhhhh-refreshing 
 Very helpful review of the basic technical and mental math type questions found in most interviews.  A very quick read and a MUST for anyone preparing for an airline interview 
 I read 2 or 3 of these books a day.  Granted I had to put myself into the mindset of a child as I read them.  I wish these were written 15 years ago so I could have enjoyed them then.  I will be introducing my son to them as soon as he can read anything beyond a picture book.  My grandmother, who reads nonstop, enjoyed them even more than I did.  
 Brosnon looks deep into peeople's personal experiences to find out how and why they chose their particular lines of work.  This book certainly caters to a white-collar crowd.  That, however, does not make it bad.  For all the kids who are currently moving back home after college, this book is a great read to show them that there are many people in their situation and that they are not alone.  
 Jackie Tortorella expressed my thoughts accurately. However, I would add this: Although this book could be termed a "page turner", I recommend that the reader take his/her time and savor this author's writing like one savors a fine wine or elegant cuisine. 
 I am designing/building my own home and this book helped me adjust my plans until I had something that suits me perfectly instead of something "saleable."  Funny thing, everyone who sees the plan and my initial start is enchanted....  Forget building houses and start building homes.  I also read A Timeless Way of Building, which is a nice introduction to this one 
 The Secret Garden treads a fine line between soppy and gritty and does it pretty well. Although some of the lyrics are not very good, the score has some very nice moments, and there are a couple of songs likely to appeal to many people, not just young girls. Most of the songs are relatively difficult in one way or another 
 I read this book as a biological parent and a stepparent. I really appreciate the author's deep and compassionate understanding of the primitive connection between parents and their biological children in stepfamilies-a connection that can leave stepparents feeling like outsiders. Because the author honors this important bond between divorced parents and their kids, she does a beautiful job of explaining the incredibly complex nature of relationships in stepfamilies. I love the author's warm, personal approach and her ability to create empathy for all members of a stepfamily. She does a great job of helping stepparents view the world from their partners' and stepchildren's point of view. She also offers very helpful tips about how to bond with stepchildren, including sample conversations about difficult topics. The bonding tips include "Conversation Starters That Get Stepchildren Talking" and other creative ideas. This book is a gold mine for stepparents 
 My Nature Journal with its fill-in worksheets may not be appropriate for library lending, but parents should consider this for kids with an affection for natural history: kids ages 8-14 will find it packed with suggestions for nature activities which encourage observation and  note-taking skills. From exploring insects and butterflies to creating  poetry and observing the sunset, this pairs facts and easy observational  instructions with fun pages of fill-in guided activities in the outdoors.  Colorful and encouraging with a very bright cover inviting participation 
 Doubt is a superb piece of theater.  Shanley is one of America's top playwrights and screen writers; and he does his best work since "Moonstruck."  The play is, in my opinion, NOT a parable. The ending is questionable and the message is murky.   Don't let that discourage you.  The play and the book will give you more for your money than you will find anywhere else this season.  The philosophy you'll find in the book and playbill.  The drama you'll find at the play 
 I dare say that Robert Fisk has seen modern war up close in all its ugly forms more than any soldier and certainly more than any of the leaders who cause these wars. And he has come to loathe what he has seen and have contempt for those who bring about these horrors and sympathy for the innocent who suffer the results. The book is difficult to read because of the details of the horrors and the betrayals of innocence and the record of man's inhumanity to his fellow man. Contrary to what some say he does have some heroes and they are the little people, the soldiers who showed humanity under difficult circumstances and civilians who did not lose their humanity. Anyone who has a romantic or patriotic view of war should read this book 
 I loved this book!  I am really impressed with the disabled characters in this novel--- the author gets their issues right on!  What a sensitive, intuitive, compassionate portrait of mentally incapacitated characters---- Madeline and Mikey are shown  with big, yearning hearts like the rest of us and their behaviors and personalities are very realistic.  It uplifted me to see how VISIBLE Madeline was in her family.  I'd recommend this book to anyone with a disabled love one.  It is uplifting, smart, and right on!  
 Cornwell's protagonist is very human, and the reader identifies with her immediately. the book, on the whole, is readable because the plot is quite interesting, but no repeat-value 
 As with any collection of short stories, there's some variance in quality here.  Several are three-star, a few are four-star, and two are five-star.  "The Long Watch" is a great character study, with emphasis on loyalty, duty, conscience, and ethics.  The title story, "The Green Hills of Earth" is a wonderful but tragic tale of heroism and bravery, reminiscent of what we saw in the NYFD on 9/11/01. These last two make the whole collection worth buying 
 Linda Gordon's "The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction" tells one small story in order to examine a far larger one. In 1904 the Catholic sisters in the employ of the New York Foundling Hospital attempted to place several white, Catholic orphans with Mexican families in the mining towns of Clifton-Morenci, Arizona. The white Protestant residents in the towns objected strenuously to the placements, and joined together to steal the children away from the prospective Mexican parents. Appalled by the scenes of mob activity and the threats made on their lives, as well as the idea of Protestants adopting Catholic children, the Foundling Hospital sued in court to retrieve the orphans. The case first went to the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court before moving on to the United States Supreme Court, which ultimately gave permanent custody of the children to the Arizona whites. This story as told by the author--an excellent example of microhistorical research--provides the impetus to pursue a host of larger subjects involving labor issues, gender, class, mob violence, and child welfare. The overarching theme is race relations.  To understand the orphan imbroglio, Gordon contends, one must understand the racial attitudes whites held about Mexicans. In the late nineteenth century, when Anglos were a weak minority trying to establish themselves in the Southwest, Mexicans could more or less stand on an equal footing with many of the white laborers and settlers. What changed? The arrival of more white settlers increased the power of Anglos. Too, the implementation of large-scale industry--here, the consolidation of individual copper mines--as the sole means of employment in the region brought about an unspoken agreement between Anglo laborers and mine owners to keep Mexican wages low.  Finally, the consolidation of white political power helped to disenfranchise Hispanic laborers. Underpinning these issues was an unchanging opinion of Mexicans. Whites saw them as dirty, itinerant immigrants whose presence threatened to drive down wages. While itinerancy was a reality in the late nineteenth century, by 1904 much of the Mexican community had settled down. Many of the mineworkers lived in Clifton-Morenci with their families and children, were productive residents, and usually only returned to Mexico for brief visits.  The orphans from New York, therefore, stepped into a complicated racial situation, a situation further exacerbated by Anglo women. They were the ones who first noticed the nuns giving children to Mexican families, and they brought their husbands into the fray in short order by promoting a vigilante solution. Gordon sees this aspect of the orphan incident as a prime example of how women could step beyond their traditional boundaries in order to take part in the public sphere normally closed to them. And this applied to both Mexican and Anglo women, as it was Hispanic women who agreed to adopt the children and Anglo women who fought to take them away. Mexican wives sought to adopt the children because they believed that a white child would make the family whiter, and therefore more acceptable to American society. White wives and mothers wished to remove the orphans from the Mexican homes because they subscribed to the racial attitudes of the time, namely that Hispanic laborers were dirty, indolent, and poor.   Linda Gordon does an excellent job of locating and scouring meager materials for information on this minor event. Her sources--court records, oral histories, interviews, and New York Foundling Hospital records--allow her to piece together most of the details concerning the actual abduction as well as the underlying issues. Her connection of the mining strike of 1903 to a hardening of racial attitudes about Mexicans is extraordinarily well done. Gordon argues that this strike, which started as a joint Anglo-Mexican effort to gain better wages and safer working conditions, allowed the company to break up the protest by painting Hispanic laborers as dangerous radicals with view threatening to white interests. That the exact same situation occurred during a 1983 walkout reveals the tenacity of racial divisions and helps confirm the accuracy of Gordon's assessment. Her perceptive analysis of the orphan trial, in which she claims that the nuns lost the case because they failed to realize that the real issue was race and not religion, is another example of effective speculation backed up by evidence. Not all of the author's conclusions seem well grounded, however. For instance, her discussion of vigilantism and the role it played in the orphan abduction raises a niggling question that begs for further elaboration.  Vigilantism, according to Gordon, occurred throughout the United States in various forms. The most pernicious type, and the one that has garnered the most attention from scholars, is the southern manifestation involving the lynching of blacks. In Clifton-Morenci during the orphan abduction, the author claims that the posse organized to recoup the children, along with the mob that threatened the sisters from the New York Foundling Hospital, constituted a vigilante action even though no one swung for it. While one cannot argue with the book's claim that many of the actions taken by the white citizens of the two towns classified as extralegal maneuvers, at least one incident in the chain of events raises a question. Why did the leaders of the town, the very same men intimately tied to the vigilante action, summon a judge to issue a ruling justifying the abduction? And why were the leaders of this legal coup "lacking confidence that the court system would decide in their favor" on this issue? Even though Judge Little refused to issue adoption papers to the whites, he also refused to assist the sisters. Everything Gordon describes about Arizona's overtly racist economic, political, and legal systems up to this point leads one to believe that court proceedings in the matter would result in an overwhelming victory for the whites, as indeed it ended up being. This is a small point to complain about in what is otherwise a solidly researched study of racism in the early twentieth century.	  	    	 	 	  	      	  
 It's been shown in psychological studies that revenge increases dopamine and other chemcials that induce a happier state.  You don't have to be a psychologist to know it feels really good when someone gets their comeuppance either.  This is probably my favorite revenge story.  Zahavi is poetic and plays with the sound of words on the tongue.  The writing is rythmic, building with each new task the main character, Bella, accomplishes.  In the book Bella is given a choice - to either continue being a lamb or become a lion.  Delciously devious at times too, this book shows the other side of being a victim - when the victim stops the world and starts turning it.  Highly suggested reading for someone in the mood for some revenge 
 This book provides a great reference to Cisco CallManager! Written by the development team that actually created the software, it gives accurate and incisive information that isn't always easy to find in the Cisco documentation. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is going to purchase, install, or maintain a CallManager system 
 We've used this since our baby was born three months ago.  It has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own. It has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear (as well as inside compartments). It also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use.  The bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around.  Our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but I have seen it used on older children.  We'll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting 
 I am 100% satisfied with this camera. This camera is worth every penny. I installed it to monitor my store and when I show the image quality to my friends who have surveillance systems in their stores/offices they are simply astonished!. The range of motion is extremely useful and you HAVE TO SEE the Zoom to belive it!. You can check the skin pores of the people if you want ;) (I'm not kidding here!); It's impressive, you can read the reports your employees are writing TOTALLY CLEAR. The 2 way Audio support is also amazing, I can pick up almost every speech of my 700 Square Feet Store, and when I'm traveling (and when i'm at my office too) I can use the camera like an IP Phone. You Name It, the Camera excels it: Image Quality, Sound Quality, EXTREME ZOOM, Low Light Image Quality, Motion Detection (and maybe a dozen more useful functions I can't remember at this moment or haven't got the time to learn).. This camera has it all... 
 A good read for parents to enjoy with their children.  Expecially the 9 to 13 group who are prone to worry about things like this.  I believe it will help to explain the tragedy of 9/11.  
 F. Paul Wilson had me hooked after The Keep, and I just recently acquire this book. He is so clever and versatile, and all the stories are great. Some are supernatural, some a creepy, some are just unsettling because of its plausability, and Wilson never leaves you a way out. You get hooked and you get rocked. This man is a genius and a short story master in the tradition of Lovecraft, King, and Matheson 
 While halfway through John Irving's Until I Find You, I decided to check out the book on Amazon.  I didn't want to read the reviews at that point, merely get an idea as to what the average rating was.  As I had guessed, it rated three stars.  If I had to guess further, I would suppose that in this case, this is not the mark of an average book, but rather the result of a lot of one and five star reviews.  From a writing standpoint, this is as good a John Irving book as ever, but the subject matter is certainly objectionable to some, hence a number of bad ratings.  Until I Find You is the fictional biography of Jack Burns who was raised by his single mother Alice.  His father Willam had disappeared before he was born, scarring both mother and child.  When Jack is four, Alice takes him on a quest through Europe in search of the errant William, earning her living as a top-notch tattoo artist.  William, however, appears to remain one step ahead of them and is never found.  When Jack enters kindergarten at a school filled mostly with girls, the reputation of his father seems to precede him.  William seems to have been known as a philanderer and Jack seems headed down the same path.  At least the girls of St. Hilda's are ready to push him down that path; from age five, he is already having sexual encounters that are inappropriate, as a plethora of older girls and women treat him in ways that would often be considered criminal.  (This is the material that is certain to turn off a lot of readers).  Eventually, however, Jack will reach adulthood and success as a movie actor.  At this point, getting women is no problem at all, but it is a shallow achievement.  In fact, one theme of the novel seems to be that sex and love are almost completely separate; for many of the characters, the two will rarely intersect.  Another theme seems to center on how much our destinies are shaped by our parents.  William is a character who is absent in most of the book, yet his influence is considerable.  Jack is forced into the same role as his father as a womanizer and can't seem to escape this fate.  Much of what he will learn as an adult will contradict all he knew as a child, which will make things even worse for him.  At 800+ pages, this is Irving's longest work, and it may be a little longer than it needs to be.  Nonetheless, it is standard Irving:  well-written with a lot of ironic humor mixed in with the more serious subject matter.  For those who've read Irving, many elements from earlier novels will be familiar:  there is wrestling, the subject of a single mother and absent father and various adventures in Europe (especially Scandanavia).  Until I Find You is a book that needs to be approached with an open mind and a willingness to deal with taboo subjects, but if you can do that, the book is a worthwhile experience. 
 I have had a photocopy of a photocopy of this book for about seven years, so I was understandably extatic to learn of the recent reissuing of this long out of print and much sought-after title. For decades, critics have discussed Film Noir as the apex of American film in terms of style as well as content. And Academy Award winner John Alton has long been hailed as perhaps the most important cinematographer of his era. Such was his passion for the art and craft of cinematography that he wrote a book on the subject at a time when such books just were not being written. Painting With Light has great verve and wit, and serves as a very practical how-to exploration of cinema- tography as it existed at the time. But, as such, it is now also a fascinating slice of movie history. In the end, however, I believe it is most valuable as a tool to help the modern cinema- tographer rediscover the texture and mystery brought to the screen in an era when films pulled you in instead of trying to leap out at you. The book c 
 Warning, this is a strange CD. It's not going to fit everyone's taste, but if you are the type that likes to explore, or extremely bored with POP music, then this is the CD for you. This was created & recorded before the computer age, yet deals with the process of the computer age. Back then some Classical Experimenters used tape loops to created multi layered repetitions of rhythm & melody. I believe the high light is "It's Gonna Rain" from a recording of a Pentecosta street preacher yelling about Noah's flood. The words "Its Gonna Rain" become rhythm with something like: "Its Its, Its Gonna Its Gonna, Gonna Gonna, Gonna Rain Gonna Rain, Rain Rain...then the piece adds layers of layers of the sermon until it becomes a vast sound effect. Believe it or not I played "It's Gonna Rain" during a Performance Art piece called "Noah's Art" where I gave out water balloons & pistols to an audience while reading & then acting out the 10 commandants. The Tape loop was used to drive everyone into a frenzy to drown me with water. It Worked. Thanks Steve 
 I've been a fan of the Vicky Bliss series for years now, though I read them all out of order.  While the mystery is not particularly tightly plotted, and our heroes have unbelievable luck in escaping death (all the while John is being beaten to a pulp in book after book), this series is full of light-hearted, well-written stories with characters that tread the thin line where realism meets sentimentality.  This is the book I read to cheer myself up after a hard week in the real world.  It never fails me 
 Excellent/Complete book, greatly written. Hard to put it down once you have began reading it. I would recommend it to everyone.  I have actually ordered a few of Sir Burton's books after reading this as he was such an interesting man.   
 Clifford Jordan was a master musician who is regrettably underrated.  So versatile - he complemented Dolphy in Mingus' band, no mean feat, which you can hear on some classic recordings.  He also played with Horace Silver, Slide Hampton, and on some excellent Japanese releases with Richard Davis on bass.  But the work that best shows his warm, innovative but down-to-earth character is the work where he is leader.  I feel the classic is the Glass Bead Game Sessions, coming back into print soon I see, and the Mapleshade label releases are all worthwhile.  This early recording, where he's already fully mature, playing his own compositions, is an essential part of the story.  Good jazz, not background music, but comfortable, full, rich and mellow, no matter where he ventures, here, he's always still at home.  You can't ever go wrong where Clifford is leader 
 As an inventor, I found this book useful. The authors explore the theme of radical innovation. Of the creating of breakthrough inventions that can in turn create new markets and experiences. The book cites many examples. Perhaps most notably that of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). As is well known to many in technology, PARC developed the seminal concepts of a mouse, icons and window based user interface. Though sadly Xerox benefitted not a whit from this.  A constant question in the book is how to discover those breakthroughs. Or, restated, how to devise an environment that can nuture such events and the people that bring them about. The authors assert that what they term "open innovation" can never lead to breakthroughs. However, truly original creativity is such a fragile and intangible thing that the book doesn't really offer a deterministic approach to finding and applying it. But perhaps no book can 
 This is probably the most useful book I've ever read.  I'm kicking myself for not reading it sooner.  1000 thanks to Dr. Ury.  This is one title you will never regret buying 
 Clear explanations and exercises that invite the reader to try for themselves.  Numberphiles and numberphobes alike will find much in this book that delights. Note that this is but one in a growing series -- "Useful Mathematical & Physical Formulae" and "Sun, Moon & earth" are two others. After I read "geometry" and "formulae" I put them on my reference shelf, and catch myself taking them down frequently, not only for the information they contain, but as a pleasant mind-tickling break from my usual work.  Can't wait to see what titles arrive next! -Paul Saff 
 This work offers some very good insight into preparing the dramatic work and is a must read for the serious student and learned writer.   The flaw that this work has is its organization (or lack thereof) in not providing a systematic break-down (bulleted perhaps) of the key concepts, aspects, and issues while providing necessary but longwinded examples intermixed with the former. However, once disected, the material is invaluable 
 This book is easy to read, entertaining, and intelligent.  Mr Pasternak is definitely an 'outside the box' thinker and his ideas are well researched and his programs work.  I'm a Personal Trainer who has fallen in love with this program and am using it to help my clients reach their goals faster without the frustration of a normal 'diet' plan.  Whether you're trying to put on muscle, lose fat, or just get that Hollywood body, this simple program will help you get there 
 I love love love this story.  It's great for all ages.  We first received this story in its paperback (scholastic)version.  I tend to like the illustrations better in that version than in this smaller, hardcover book.  Nevertheless, an excellent read with your kids.  This would be extremely beneficial for pre-teen (middle school age) kids 
 I've purchased so many vacuum cleaners in the past few years and I hated them all.  Usually because the cord was too short, the hose wasn't long enough to reach the stairs, the unit would tip over when I used the hose, the bag was messy to change, my bagless filters clogged too fast and wouldn't suck, and the filters are expensive!  Other vacuums I purchased were too heavy, too noisy, too hard to roll, etc....are you still with me?  Then you must know what I mean!  I got tired of buying vacuum cleaners and not liking them when it came down to really using them.  Finally my husband said enough!  He had heard that Dyson made a good vacuum cleaner, but I didn't want to spend over $300 for another vacuum that I will hate!  This one is everything I could ask for!  Imagine a light vacuum cleaner that hugs the floor, even when you vacuum under furniture, it retains it's suction on the carpet!  It doesn't tip over when you use the hose and it's so light when I use the attachments on the stairs, that I didn't notice how long the hose is.  It seems to be long enough for all of my needs.  This unit is easy to roll and just feels like a Cadillac when I'm using it.  It doesn't rattle or vibrate too much and is definitely the quietest one I've ever had.  Emptying the bagless container is as easy as pressing a button and the filter can be washed every six months.  It came with a spare, so I don't have to wait for the filter to dry before I can vacuum again.  Well, sorry to have written a book, but I can't say enough good things about this vacuum 
 Find a used second edition. In good shape, because you will wear it out.  Probably the most useful reference for a writer in addition to a good  style manual. Not just the what but the why - with wonderful examples 
 This may not be one of the most well known albums of it's time ,but it's one of those masterpeices that kind of fell through the cracks of the busy music business.If you like good rock and roll, or if you're more eclectic  of taste, this one will get your attention, and I'll wager that you'll  never trade your copy in 
 Ten year old Charlie Bone discovers he has a unique talent - he can hear the thoughts of people in photographs. Charlie's Grandmother Bone and her sisters are delighted that Charlie has inherited powers, the gift runs in the family and his late father also was one of the "endowed". They insist that Charlie attend Bloor's Academy where he can further develop his powers. Charlie reluctantly goes and soon realizes there are odd things going on at Bloor's. Before he quite knows exactly what is going on, Charlie is deep in a mystery involving a case with something mysterious inside it and a missing child and also discovers his father may not be dead after all.  "Midnight for Charlie Bone" was a good first book in what looks like a promising series. Comparisons with Harry Potter are inevitable but the book should be judged on it's own merit and it's not bad at all. Charlie is a strong character, a good friend to misfit Benjamin, and his struggles with his newly developed powers are very real. The other children in the book are well written, especially the delightful Olivia. The adults in the book are either just plain bad, or, with the exception of Charlie's Uncle Paton, good but ineffectual.  Even though the book is 400 pages long, parts of it felt rushed, especially the ending and the surrender of the bad guys. And, perhaps it's just me, but some of the happenings in the book seemed unexplained, like who initially opened the door and let Emma out of her "prison". Still, the book makes me want to continue reading the series, especially to see if the person I suspect is Charlie's father really is.  A good beginning. 
 "Life's Rich Pageant" is R.E.M.'s best record perhaps because it came at a crossroads, as R.E.M. was emerging from college radio and only a couple of years away from MTV.  The jangling guitars of "Murmur" and "Reckoning" are still there, but the band rocks harder than before, and now you can hear the lyrics.  Regardless of whether you agree with Michael Stipe's politics, his word pictures of the consequences of rampant greed, government without compassion, and environmental rape are lyrically beautiful and powerfully sung.  Stipe has a great voice and these songs are his best because he became confident enough to mix the album so that we can hear what he's saying, but this album is also before the preachy excesses of some of his later songs in the 90's.  "Fall On Me" remains my favorite R.E.M. song, an emotional environmental lament.  Peter Buck and Mike Mills rock on "I Believe" and "These Days," two songs worth hearing over and over again.  "Swan Swan H" is a sad song that is one of the last they would record in which they pay homage to their Southern roots.    When this album came out, I thought R.E.M. was the greatest band in the world, bar none.  They went on to release a couple more great albums, and they continue to have some great songs, but this was R.E.M.'s high water mark.  If you already are a fan of the band, you already have it.  If you want to explore R.E.M., this is probably a good place to start. 
 I Bought this cd right after I saw the movie ( which I highly recommend as well) and loved it the minute I put it in my cd player.  It blends all the antiquity of the european choirs with middle eastern styles.  The album really brings you on the wave of what this character in the movie went through and brings you through his haunted beginnings into his glorious days as a crusader defending the Holy Land.  I truly recommend it to all sound track collectors and music lovers alike 
 A fantastic and realist look at 'the joys ' of being pregnant. A realistic look at what's happening to your body and a great assurance you are not alone. I highly recommend this book. 
 Very good book and well worth the time reading it.  It is full of very good information 
 im glad i opted for this item rather than the expensive ones, it works well for all bottles sizes... for those who want to get the job done, yet not spend too much money...this is it

 While numerous books on leadership are released every year, most are too vague to be effective in helping the reader implement the recommended practices (i.e., usually broad, too academic, or merely describe behaviors of leaders).  "The Feiner Points" is exceptional because it describes specific actions and activities one can undertake.  The author, Michael Feiner, takes a hands-on approach and attempts to answer every reader's natural question: "what can I do today?" to become a better leader. Feiner provides tangible and functional suggestions (he calls them "Laws") throughout the book that are simple and memorable, and thus easy to apply. (Note: The concepts in the book can be applied at various stages of one's career.)  Another reason the book is effective is because the author has taken the viewpoint of a lifelong career and leadership "coach." This differs from other books written by famous leaders, whose advice is often only applicable to someone with similar personality traits or facing a similar situation. Feiner, having seen and worked with a variety of leadership styles, recognizes this and effectively conveys ideas that work for many different personality types.  Overall, the book is simple, straight-to-the-point, and easy to apply... recommended! 
 Being that Slim Aarons recently passed away, his work warrants an even closer work. What this book and the equally impressive Once Upon a Time have in common is that they portray true grace, elegance and class that makes todays celebrities look like a bunch of bums. 
 I first read the Cellulite Solution, did the program, and got great results.   I just finished reading this book, which was also easy to read, and can't wait to get started on the program.  If I can get rid of my cellulite, I can't imagine what this might do for my wrinkles.... 
 Alice,Princess Andrew of Greece is the story of a fascinating, not well known royal. Born into the Battenburg Family of Germany,Queen Victoria witnessed the birth of her great-grandaughter.Alice,was discovered to be deaf,but her mother taught her to read lips. The deafness did not appear to handicap her.In her girlhood she was extremely intelligent,and considered one of the young beautiful princesses of her time. In 1903 she married Prince Andrea of Greece(hence becoming Princess Andrew.)The women in Europe,unlike England,took the name of their husband when they married. Alice was devoted to her godmother,Ella,Grand Duchess of Russia.She imitated her charitable works and was a nurse during the Balkan Wars(1913),that preceeded World War I. It was here she first manifested her mania.Not sleeping for three days and singlehandedly building Operating Theaters in the midst of the War. The Princess had four daughters and one son,the current  Prince Phillip of England. In the 1920's she was unable to care for her chidren.Due to the death's of many close relatives,Tsarina Alix of  Russia,Aunt Ella,it is believed her illness became worse and she lost touch with reality. The biography drags a little here,but I think it is because she was in treatment seven years. In her later years she believed she was an Orthodox Nun. Without,a country,the present Queen Elizabeth allowed her to live quietly in England. If you read this book,first consult the geneology lists in  the back of the book.Apparently,the Queen and Prince Philip are fourth cousins,both descendants of Queen Victoria. Despite her illness,Alice is a Princess who gave much to others,and deserves to be remembered.History will not forget this woman,who helped during the Holocaust and saved lives.She along with Oskar Schlinder is remembered in Israel as one of the Righteous 
 This classic by A. W. Tozer is so powerful that you can't keep it to yourself. You do not want someone with whom you are close to miss out on the spiritual gems in this book. I am buying several copies to give to my friends. Tozer's deep spiritual insights cause you to look into the mirror of your heart while filling that same heart with an insatiable hunger for the relationship with God that He so desires for you 
 You would think that by now everybody would have learned. You would think that the '87 crash taught investors a lesson and you would certaintly think that the Clinton Bear Markets followed by the Big Crash in 2000 would have really taugh everybody a lesson. What lesson? Every expansion is followed by a crash. Everytime. It happened in 1927 and as already mentioned, it happened in '87, there was the Asian crisis and two bear markets in '97 and '98 and then 'buy and hold' investors really got wiped in 2000  I am all for the stock market. I am invested. But I am not a 'buy and hold', listen to my broker and cross my fingers type hoping for the best. Robert Kiyosaki is not bearish on the stock market either. He is only cautioning people on what is going to happen again when the baby boomers retire. And just for your information, it has already started. The first leg of the baby boomers are already retiring or retired.   Rich Dad's Prophecy is not a 'Doom and Gloom', the world is crashing type of book. But it does offer words of advice on how to prepare for the coming crash.   Kiyosaki indicates that there will be another major bull market first and others such as Harry S. Dent have predicted the same thing. Dent predicted the 1990's boom  before anyone else and the subsequent bust that came in 2000. Dent has predicted another bubble that will take the Dow to as high as 40,000 and the Nasdaq to 13,000 by late 2009 or early 2010. But guess what is going to follow that expansion?  I highly recommend reading Rich Dad's Prophecy, Rich Dad's Guide to Investing and The Next Great Bubble Boom by Harry S. Dent.   Remember, hope is not a strategy!  
 Wow the mighty b-52 has a great history indeed.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a b-52 buff like myself.The Vietnam war stories are just awesome to read.I really learned so much from this book.Osprey publishing has some great books i go get this book right now

Dat movie is mad scary man!  Peace out dawg 
 This book was an amazing combination of original Disney art and facts. I love the fact that it covered Disney attractions from around the world and added commentary about how they were created. Well presented and beautifully designed 
 this is the 7th time this movie has been made and while it may not be the best it is certainly a worthwhile film to watch especially for the spectacular battle scenes. We were fortunate to find a great site to buy it on www.hardtofindrecordings.com as they have it seems every film ever made whether in print or not. I highly recommend both the film and the website 
 I thought that the book was a balanced collection of wonderful and telling tales of life in Brazil; well rounded and very well put together. I strongly recommend it 
 This is a book that is very easy to read. It is succinct and thelanguage smooth. The points made in the book are more relevant today than at the time that the book was written. I am sure that if Barbara Tuchman was still alive she would surely add another chapter on Iraq, changing the title to THE MARCH OF FOLLY: FROM TROY TO IRAQ.  It is a work that I would highly recommend to any serious student of histroy as well as those who are cocnerned with the  progess of humanity 
 H.G. Wells story and pretty Dakota Fanning, what else you can ask for. If you are a fan of TOM then even better. watched plenty of times. maybe overpalyed a little but still a good flic 
 I grew up in  Hannibal Mo, so I am very familiar with Mark Twain's writing and his humor.  The make up is great as Holbrook even looks like Twain.  Holbrook is a great story teller, and he uses the material well, and makes it wa wonderful program.  I saw a perfomance live in NYC years ago, and another one in my current home town.  Each time I see it again, it is still funny and a great performance 
 We read our book as a group in an education class during our senior block.  We all agreed that "My Dog Skip" is a great book for all ages.  It is very easy to read, and most people can relate to it especially if you are from the South.  It is about a young boy and his relationship with his dog.  The author, Willie Morris, does a great job describing details to keep the reader's interest 
 I saw this when it first appeared on American television on 'Masterpiece Theater' when it originally was aired in 1978/79. It was superb. I am watching it again, on a very good DVD player and HD TV. It is still great. If you have seen 'Band of Brothers' you will love this. It sets the standard that was carried forward with BofB. Buy this. Worth every thing.Got a great price too 
 What do you get when you cross an apparent accident victim that nobody hates, an aged emaciated former model millionare's purported suicide, and an unidentified natty silver haired Lothario dressed in candy-striped flair found dead in an remote forest preserve?  A confusing, cat-and-mouse game where our heros and heroines Annie, Max, Emma, Henny and friends spring into action to protect their friend, find a killer where the police are convinced there is none, and connect the dots to the mysterious stranger.  Amidst grief, a daring escape, adolescent angst, and buried jealously, the plot spins and twists, concluding in a dangerous race against a killer, and heroism from an unlikely source.  The killer is caught, and the party restored where the answers to the shortened mystery cruise are revealed, family peace is restored, and the happy crew of the Death on Demand crowd can pat themselves on the back for another mystery well solved 
 In DEATH IN THE JUNGLE Gary A. Smith tells the story of his 1st of 5 tours in Vietnam with the elite SEAL Teams.  From all night ambushes to nearly being left to fend for themselves in the jungle, Smith and his comrades share their pranks, parties, and sorrows in this book.  Another great one 
 Jam packed with wisdom and insight for all people. A must read for all women and one that you will read many times. Sure wish I had this guide when I was a young woman. Plan to use as a discussion book for a spirituality group. A fabulous book to give as a gift. 
 I read this book a few years ago and was throughly amazed. Nasr exposition of Sufism is excellent. He plunges into history and literature to and brings out profound insight into some fo the aspects of Sufism. He essay on the Sufi Shaykh is wonderful. Nevertheless the book has its flaw. The insertation of perrenial thought and propagation of the Universalvalidity of Religions is dogmatic in certain essay. The author simply goes and concludes that Sufi thought stresses the Universal Validity of Religions. Such a statement if false and goes against the Islamic texts and there explanation. In essence the book is wonderful and contains beneficial knowledge, but at the end the perrenial taint leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. Overall good read but one should take caution about the above mentioned mistake 
 (3.5/5 stars)  Gerard Depardieu is Andre, the father who is so desperate to have his daughter, Nicole, back as his little girl again that he plays along when she pretends he is her lover in order to make the guy she likes jealous. Very cute movie, with some funny moments as initially everyone except Depardieu knows about Nicole's little ploys. Katherine Heigl is a good choice for Nicole, a teenager embarrassed by her father and anxious to make her summer vacation memorable. Not exactly thought provoking material, but pleasant and enjoyable all around. Sure to please its intended audience, based on other reviews here. Maurice Chevalier would be glad. 
 I concur with other reviewers as to the generosity of the authors. There are so many valuable tips in this book. I have just started my boat and have already realized some time-savings. I am very pleased with this book 
 I am very pleased with this book.  Davis begins by orienting Lev's work within Husserl's phenomenology and distinguishes Lev from Heidegger.  So many thinkers are difficult to comprehend because lousy intro books don't place them in context.  Davis elegantly relates the role of ethics in distinction to Heidegger's concerns.  He goes deeper by discussing the influence of Descartes and Kant leading to Lev's postmodern ethic.  Davis writing is direct, yet still conveys passion for Lev's accomplishments.  Finally, he consistently iterates that he is in some ways doing a disservice to Lev by paraphasing his work into a meager introduction.  It may have disserved Lev, but it sure helped me and many others.  Great book I highly recommend 
 Always been a Buffy fan, and getting all the seasons boxed together like this at this price - a bargain in anyone's books. Also saves on space 
 Of all the case interview preparation books I've read, Case in Point has provided, by far, the most relevant case interview preparation! Cosentino's Ivy System breaks down daunting case problems into simple steps that are easy to understand. This book is full of witty, relevant examples of all types of practice cases, with detailed answers, and tips on how to ace your interview with top consulting firms. The new version of Case in Point is a must buy even if you own or have read the 3rd edition. The beauty of it is that Cosentino provides more case examples, updated based on what consulting firms are asking their interviewees today. Buy this book today-you won't be disappointed 
 The "Jackasses" never let me down. They always have something new up their sleeves. I especially like Chris Pontius when he plays as "Party Boy". That is so funny 
 The story being told here has been covered by others, namely in `The Samson option' and `Israel and the bomb' however this book not only updates the story regarding the Yom Kippur War but also explores the characters involved, it is a story worth telling again and a brilliant examination of the personalities of Ben-Gurion, Peres and others.  Most familiar with Israel today will be surprised to learn that France was Israel's closest ally in the 1950s, when America opposed Israeli policies.  This book serves as a good account also of the nature of Israeli reasoning regarding the bomb.  This is not a dramatically biased book, so most readers should be able to stomach it, since most people are incapable of reading anything about Israel if it doesn't fit their ideological love-hate of the country, but this book should sidestep this to some extant, unlike `Samson' option it isn't basing its logic on the question of why Jews should or shouldn't be allowed to develop nuclear weapons by using Biblical analysis, rather it is a modern fair book examining how Israel obtained the bomb.  Israel, alone among the many nations who covertly have attempted to develop nuclear weapons secretly(Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, Libya etc...), did not sign the non-proliferation treaty, so as to remain `ambiguous' and thus not in violation, unlike other hypocritical nations who sign the bogus treaty and then build nukes.  Ironically the very same people that condemn Israel's possession of nukes are the same people who condemn America for daring to invade Iraq because of WMDs, in there view Israel possessing WMDs is tantamount to the `holocaust' whereas Iraq or Iran pursuing the same objective is merely for `national defense and sovereignty and combating colonialism'.  A good read, fair, however it is a mostly popular work.  Seth J. Frantzman  
 This is the latest entry in a series of novels based on the fictional character Irene Adler Norton from the Sherlock Holmes story A Scandal In Bohemia. This is also the second volume of a duology that began with Femme Fatale. In this latest volume Irene is in New York City of 1889 and seeking to uncover if her mother is the infamous Lola Montez. If that is not enough, she gets drawn into Holmes' case involving threats to the Vanderbilt family.   Carole Nelson Douglas has a delightful way of blending fictional and historic characters together with her own strong feminist point of view to re-envision the role of women in the nineteenth century.  In this particular foray, we see the lives of Lola Montez, Alva and Consuelo Vanderbilt, and reporter Nellie Bly re-examined through the feminist perspective of Irene Adler and her partner in detective work, Nell Huxleigh.  Douglas has also developed a delightful multi-narrator style for revealing her story that mixes entries from various participants into a lively manner of plot evolution. This is offset with "quotes" from various historical sources that introduce each chapter. These two narrative devices are well executed in this particular story.  So take an exciting journey into late 19th century New York and explore the mysteries that Ms. Douglas unfolds. She has an excellent attention to detail and history that brings the subject to life 
 If you do not want to consider the injustice of schooling in America, not just public schooling, do not read this book. I first read it when I was a beginning teacher and "Death at an Early Age" affected my entire 32 year teaching career. In the age of "No Child Left Behind," we refuse to realize that school reflects the entire society in which we live. The PURPOSE of education is no longer (if it ever was) to give every child a fair chance. Education is the first of many sorting systems to make sure that nobody escapes the social class into which they are born. Because school is competitive, every "concerned parent" with the resources to do it makes sure that their own child gets an extra edge, even if all children were getting the same education at school. If you read this book, it might infect you with the desire to make sure that, not only is "No Child Left Behind," but that every child really has a fair chance. You might start trying to make sure that every child can learn and grow to be the adult he/she could be if born to the wealthiest family in America. Teaching under the influence of this book could become an endless struggle to address the inequities of this world 
 this is the best cd by dmx.  very good lyrics and crisp rapping.  the beats are not the greatest but when hes rapping they dont need to be.  the best songs are ruff ryders anthem,damien, x is coming,stop being greedy, and look thru my eyes.  the skits could also have been left out like they always should but besides that great rap cd.  one of the top 3 that i own 
 The attention to the little details is what makes this book great for those of us in the business. Particularly anyone who has ever run volunteer fire,  the chapter in which he describes what the pager going off next to your head in the middle of the night does to your system is priceless and deadon accurate... this book is a must read 
 I bought it because it was on sale and I thought it would be cute for a party even if it didn't last too long. After reading the comments about the battery getting wet, I put two layers of strapping tape over the battery compartment to keep it dry before I used it the first time and that seeems to have worked. I put the fish in the pool at the start of a pool birthday party for my nine year old daughter and it was a big hit. Some of the girls swam around with it most of the evening. They weren't exactly gentle, either. They grabbed it and pulled it under several times. They were in the water about three hours but the next day I realized that we didn't get the fish out. I found it partially submerged in the skimmer basket. I shook it out and tried it at another swim event and it still swims.  
 This record opens with "Rainy Day Women Nos. 12 & 36" and I can remember driving from LA to TJ with that record on the cassette player. I was riding with three friends and we played that record all the way there. Over and Over listening to that refrain, "Everybody must get stoned." We were college girls out for a good time. We did tequila shooters south of the border, but we were back Stateside by dark, I guess we weren't quite as daring as we thought we were. In the motel in Chula Vista we played the whole album on my portable cassette player. We cried during "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" even though it's probably not a crying song. "Vision of Johanna" is just the best. "I Want You," is a gripping rocker. "Just Like a Woman," is just like this whole record, Just outstanding, superb, really 
 You can learn a lot abt the human anatomy and charcoal techiques. Good buy 
 I saw this film awhile ago and plan to watch it again because I purchased it.  This is a beautiful romance.  The setting is unique, 1950 Sweden in the country.  It's semtimental but not sappy.  It's not predictable and formularistic 
 Right on in 1996; eight years ago. But with technologies changing so rapidly, that's a long time without an update. I'd like to hear from Mr. Romano now. I'm receiving a certificate in digital prepress in December. It would be helpful to know where things are now in my chosen field of endeavor and where he thinks they are going

 I first became familiar with Found when I flipped through my mom's copy of the first book. She had heard about the book from some local radio station. At first the basic premise of the book didn't sound too intriguing. It sounded like a book full of trash. Essentially, that is what Found is, but trash that tells stories. Love letters, photos, shopping lists, homework (one kid handed in a report on a certain part of the male anatomy) etc. Some finds are funny. Some tragic. Some heartwarming. Think of the finds as short stories, sometimes conisisting of only a few words. Or better yet, windows into the lives of others. This is one of those books that is fun to just pick up and flip through making it a perfect "coffee table" book. I took the first Found book to work a few years ago and was constantly lending it to people (or rather leaving it around while people couldn't help but be intrigued) who would soon be showing me their favorite finds. After reading this book you will never look at trash the same way again. I constantly scan the streets in search of my own finds worthy of Found Magazine. So far the most interesting thing I've found is a name tag that says "Pastor John Issacs." I wore it around work for awhile as a joke before it broke and another card behind the one that said "Pastor John" spilled out. It said "Elizabeth Jenson". Why did Pastor John have Elizabeth Jenson's nametag? Duel-Identities perhaps? You make up the story. The same goes with many of the finds in this book. I highly recomend purchasing both FOUND and FOUND II 
   Although it was not widely recognised at the time, the choice of Vladimir Putin as Prime Minister of Russia in 1999 appears to have marked the beginning of a transition from chaos to order in the once communist nation. The question is, in moving away from chaos, might the pendulum swing once again towards the repression of the Soviet years?. But while Western political pundits and politicians talk of a return to Stalinism, the majority of Russians appear to be unconcerned; Putin and his nationalist policies enjoy high levels of support.   Despite what many commentators would have us believe, the situation in Russia is complex; fortunately, Andrew Jack's 'Inside Putin's Russia' offers help in understanding it. The book provides us with a well documented and equally well balanced account of the surprising rise of Russia's President, and of the struggle for power and control over an emerging society. Jack, a former Moscow Bureau Chief for the Financial Times, tracks the course of Putin's career, from his rather low-profile time with the KGB, to his development into a more polished and more authoritarian President whose efforts to place the country back under the control of the central government have met with mixed reviews in the West.  Personal history aside, the real value of Inside Putin's Russia is that it provides us with a richly detailed description of the political context in which to judge the man and his actions. Control of the media is one key area. The Russian President has been strongly criticised for bringing independent media under state control, but as Jack points out, the Russian media has enjoyed very few, and very short, periods of independence. At the time of Putin's first presidential victory most 'independent' sources were to a large extent under the control of commercial interests, principally those of 'Oligarchs': the men who gained ownership of much of Russian state assets in exchange for financial or media support of Boris Yeltsin's presidency.   The struggle for control of the television channel NTV, once owned by the Oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky, has been portrayed in Western media as a simple issue of freedom of the press, but as Jack's presentation makes obvious, there are other important aspects. Media independence is an important element in a pluralistic society,it is therefore a problem that much of the Russian media now functions as an organ of the state. However, it would be naïve to assume that the press is free where it is not under state control. The ground rules must be clearly set out, but the question is, by whom, the state or the super rich? In western liberal democracies the answer is also not as clear as we might wish while Rupert Murdoch and Silvio Berlusconi continue to increase their influence over political processes. The Russians are not the only people with problems, and it ought to be more of a concern.  Putin's Russia has also come under attack as being 'undemocratic' but it would be wise to take into account that the country is not, and has no history of being, a liberal democracy. As Jack rightly points out, most of its citizens believe the role of the state to be fundamental, hence the approval of policies involving greater state control. Much of the criticism has its roots in American efforts to pre-empt any future Russian threat, and their need for continued access to increasingly important Russian oil. The campaign has, meanwhile, proved a useful vehicle for more personal agendas. As part of his own anti-Putin crusade, Boris Berezovsky is funding Human Rights groups, some of which paint the Oligarchs - particularly the now jailed Mikhail Khodorkovsky - as 'victims' of Human Rights abuses rather than the beneficiaries of a highly unethical, although technically legal, massive transfer of public funds to private pockets.   The case for respecting Human Rights is more evident in Chechnya. Whether Putin has made a Faustian bargain with the military, allowing them free rein in order to concentrate on other areas, or whether he himself is directing operations, the results of the re-occupation of Chechnya and the 'dirty war' being waged there now the official conflict is over, are brutal. No matter that one unnamed Russian officer is quoted as claiming that the army is 'only' responsible for 50% of disappearances. It remains to be seen if  the situation can be changed and the army curbed. For the military, the occupation now appears to have become, as Jack puts it, 'its own raison d'etre', while the roots of the 'Chechen Problem' itself go back beyond the first war of 1994-6, beyond even the chaos and corruption that invaded the region after the collapse of the USSR.   Inside Putin's Russia manages to find a way through the Chechen minefield without veering too much to one side or another. It is to Andrew Jack's credit that he does not lend himself to simplistic analyses and presents information on which we can form an opinion. That does not mean that the tangle of characters and vested interests is always easy to follow, but Jack can hardly be blamed for that, and he has taken the trouble to provide a helpful Dramatis Persona.   As for Putin's legacy, in many respects he deserves credit for curbing the excesses of the Yeltsin period and bringing financial resources back under state control. But the Russian President has questions to answer, in particular over Chechnya, and in his quest for order he may have, or may be tempted to go too far. Overall, Jack is probably correct when he states: "He (Putin) is unlikely to go down in history as a great transformational leader. But he may yet be viewed as playing an essential role of cohesion, stability and predictability - in domestic and even international affairs". After the roller coaster ride of the Yeltsin years, that will be no small achievement.   Gerard Coffey is European Correspondent of the South American journal, Tintaji.    
 This book was recommended to me by a woman who specializes in all the aspects of sleep disorders. Just buying the book actually helped me to sleep better! Jacobs' common sense, holistic approach made a lot of sense to me, and I have basically been sleeping soundly since I got it, after 3+ years of insomnia. The suggestion of morning exposure to natural light and morning exercise has been revolutionary to me. Maybe that is obvious folk wisdom, but it took a Harvard Med School doctor to write a book about it! I have never written an Amazon review before, and hyperbole doesn't come naturally, but this book changed my life 
 Whether you are in college or a grandparent, this book has a story for you. I just love the one about the guy in Cairo! Do yourself a favor and get this book 
 Producer Andrew Sandoval has pulled together twenty-four superb psych-pop tracks from the WEA vaults, including sides culled from master tapes of Warner, Reprise, Loma, Atco, Valiant, and Cotillion. The focus is on singles, with a few album tracks mixed in, and primarily from artists who were either unknown, or were stepping outside their regular domain for an experimental run down the psychedelic highway. Some of the best known names here are those of the session producers, including Lenny Waronker, Jerry Yester, Don & Phil Everly, Don Adrissi, Jimmy Bowen, Joey Levine, Curt Boettcher, and Richard Perry.  Better known artists, like The Tokens, are represented by sides that step away from their familiar hits, and the one-off singles and rare album tracks explore lesser known sides of the commercial psych boom. Though recorded in proper studios for major labels, these tracks still temper their hit-seeking with a healthy dollop of experimental. The key years of 1966 through 1968 yield an entire program of psych-tinged folk and sunshine rock, heavy on the harmonies and studio craft.  Highlights include the trippy vocals, space sounds and discothèque beat of Baker Knight's "Hallucinations," the raga jangle of Adrian Pride's "Her Name is Melody," the funky "Straight Aero" by Jeff Thomas, the jugband-styled harmonies of MC^2's "My Mind Goes High," the Sgt. Pepper-esque "Lucifer" from future Ohio Express mastermind Joey Levine, and the droning "Hell Will Take Care of Her" from Brass Buttons. Fans of the mid-80s paisley underground, particularly The Rain Parade, early Bangles and Three O'Clock, will find this volume familiar and compelling.  '60s folk fans will want to check out the Curt Boettcher-produced cover of Bob Gibson and Phil Ochs' "That's the Way It's Gonna Be," complete with a variable-speed guitar and backward koto instrumental break. Songwriter Paul Williams' debuts as a performer on The Holy Mackerel's "Wildflowers," complete with Leslie-fied lead vocals, and the original mono single mix of The Monkees' "Porpoise Song" makes it's CD debut. Producer Sandoval lovingly documents each side with details on the band and the circumstances of the track's creation. The insert booklet also includes many photos and label reproductions, and the purpose-built tri-fold digipack features a neat pop-art color wheel. Originally issued by Rhino Handmade as "Hallucinations: Psychedelic Pop Nuggets from the WEA Vaults," this has been reissued with a minor track change under the title, "My Mind Goes High."

 When I sat down and told the kids to listen to the first chapter I got some grumbling but by the middle of the first chapter they were engrossed with me and begged for another chapter!  Very lively and entertaining--we had to stop and laugh several times!  A pure enjoyable read and great for kids! 6****** from us

 I want to preface this review by mentioning that I am a teacher.  I work in an urban, low-income district with students who have many similarities to those in Rafe's class.  Though I teach high school students, many of the issues are all too familiar.  I first became interested in this book after seeing an interview with the author on PBS.  I immediately ordered the book and am so glad I did, as it could prove to be one of the most important steps that I ever take as an educator.  It is having a huge impact on my philosophy of education and gave me many strategies for dealing with my students on a daily basis.  I enjoyed my job before, and I work hard and try to do a good job, but am often worried that I'm not doing enough for the kids.  And don't get me wrong, I am not going to arrive 3 hours early and stay 3 hours late to teach Sally some guitar lessons.  If I did that, I wouldn't have any time to prepare engaging lessons.  But I am enjoying my job more now and working harder now because I have a greater goal, in a sense.    It's hard to really put into words just what this book did for me.  But believe me, it's had a huge impact on my life, both professionally and personally.  Thanks to Rafe for sharing his experiences and ideas with the world.  And to those who get all wrapped up in the whole, "Oh, he's trying to come off as a martyr" thing - there's so much more to get out of this book!  If you get caught up in that, you're bound to miss all those unpolished gems of ideas that are scattered throughout the book 
 Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) was of course one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century.  THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY (1912) is a classic introduction to the perennial questions of philosophy (although it focuses mainly on epistemology and metaphysics).  It is an engaging book that can be read by both the beginner in philosophy as well as the more advanced student.  (For example, Russell described much of what is considered the "Gettier problem" in this book.)   Russell had an amazingly long and productive life.  He was a key figure in the school known as analytic philosophy (which has one of its earliest appearances in book form here) and was the founder of logical atomism (which can be dated from his 1914 work OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD).  His last major work of technical philosophy (HUMAN KNOWLEDGE) appeared in 1948 and after that time was largely known for his social and political activism.    In reading Russell, there are a couple things to remember.  First, Russell wasn't always the most accurate expositor on the history of philosophy and religion (you can skip his HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY if you are interested in learning about the subject matter of the book).  Second, just because he is often considered an empiricist, it is a mistake to consider him a consistent empiricist, much less a logical positivist.  Russell's logical atomism had a metaphysics, albeit a rather pared down one.  During large parts of his career, Russell was keenly aware that strict empiricism was a dead end.  Indeed, in THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY he sets forth a famous defense of universals that put him in the realist, as opposed to nominalist camp (where most empiricists are).  There is also a good defense of a priori insight, which shows Russell's rationalist roots. 
 This is a great book for people who have always wanted to be actionable in  analyzing customer satisfaction and loyalty data to make strategic  decisions.  The book provides concrete examples with real data to step you  through in building satisfaction models that lead to bottom line  performance.  It is extremely well written for a broad range of audience  from the novist to the experts.  This book not only provides you with the  necessary tools to run models but also explains in an easy to understand  manner the underlying reasons and background as to how customer  satisfaction and loyalty models should be approached.  I would highly  recommend this book to anyone who desires to have the ability to actually  run customer satisfaction models and make intelligent interpretation and  executive decisions 
 I wasn't that excited about reading "Wives and Daughters", since I'd just finished "North and South" by Mrs. Gaskell, and found it rather tedious.  I was pleasantly surprised.    Gaskell did a fabulous job drawing the characters in this book.  Cynthia is one of the most skillfully crafted characters I have ever encountered.  She's shallow and selfish, but also very kind and lovable -- and it's completely believable.  All the others are very easy to accept as "real people" - something I don't encounter very often in victorian literature.    It's a love story that becomes predictable early on, but the complexities along the way are fascinating.  Molly finds herself in the middle of every scandal, although she has nothing to do with any of it.  Her stepmother, who throws off phony aristocratic airs at every turn, is actually a very funny character rather than a villain.  Though Molly has had to face many hurtful challenges, she never acts victimized.  Though she struggles with the choices she has to make, she never loses her strength.    It's sad that Gaskell didn't live to finish this book, but it's pretty much wrapped-up where she left off, so not much is lacking.  Don't let that stop you from reading this book

 THIS DESERT LIFE is an interesting piece of work. Melodies, harmonies, and lyrics are the album's standing out traits. Counting Crows' piano player has a very interesting take on how to use the instrument to achieve unique musical sounds.

Stand out tracks include:  "Hanginaround" "Mrs. Potter's Lullaby" "All My Friends" "Colorblind

 Great fun. Dickens' first novel, the first mass-market best seller in world history (coming on the heels of the invention of cheap paper). Essential reading for Victorian Literature and the evolution of Dickens' style. This edition (with footnotes and introduction, two appendices and maps) is fine in all respects, except that the print is too small 
 While I do agree in part with the review by MartinP, I think this recording is a good mirror to hold the wispelwey recording to. I found Wispelwey's rubato passages far more irritating, but was surprised to hear Kliegel hesitating in the last movement. She has such incredible, unbelievably gorgeous and effortless technique in her recordings of the shostakovich cello concerti in the same year as this recording, I was pretty sad to hear her falter and use slower tempi in the third movement of this piece. And yes, there is a whole page missing.   But, I do like her tempo in the 2nd movement far better than the veeeeryyyy slow tempo chosen by Wispelwey, for whatever reason.   When it comes right down to it however, this piece is so very subjective. When a cellist works on it (and I now have spent 20 years off and on, thinking about it and working on it), it becomes a part of them even as the Bach solo suites. So, when one hears another cellist taking liberties with "their" piece, inevitable umbrage results.   I would say buy both, and buy the starker too while you're at it. His rendition, in my opinion, has very little emotion but his typical effortless technique that makes it sound like a walk in the park, so the three together should provide a wide range of possibility 
 I bought this game for my four year old.  She now can count backwards and forwards upto twenty with ease.  She loves playing the game all the time and has yet to get bored of it even after 6 months of constant play.  The box is getting a little worn with all her use.  But everything else is holding up great.  
 ....this collection of some of Z's short stories include the title story, in which Lancelot and Merlin meet up for a bit of unfinished business, the short story version of "Damnation Alley," and the moving  "Comes Now The Power.&quot 
 I was really apprehensive about buying this series, only because I figured since I knew the outcome, I wouldn't enjoy it.  I was wrong.  I have watched the series several times and it gets better each time.  This group of survivors was by far the best group that has been on the show. The events that occurred on the show encompassed so many aspects of humanity.  Of any of the shows, this is the series to get 
 Great product, and great price at amazon! I live in Malaysia, where the local price is 250% of Amazon's list price. For USD9$ (shipment) I had it delivered in Singapore in just a few days, and picked it up at my friend's place. First thing that came out when I plugged it in, was that my old monitor had lived its useful life. Althought the colors were still correct(able), the overall luminosity was so low that I could only work in a dark room to view the full scale. I bought a new LCD monitor, calibrated and profiled it in a few minutes (it wasn't quite right straight out of the box - too bright), and now all my pictures come out beautifully! I can display 256 shades of grey distinctively, which was previously impossible. It's not just photos, even the dull windows interface suddenly comes to life. Highly recommended to anyone with a DSLR and a desire to spend more than 5 minutes improving their pictures on photoshop. 
 Wendell Berry is a farmer, poet, novelist and literary critic. It is as an essayist of enormous acuity, however, that he has become best known. What Are People For? is an important collection of essays (and two 'poem  essays') written between 1975 and 1989. The pieces here range from the  literary and reflective - meditations on the work of writers such as Edward  Abbey and Wallace Stegner, to the empassioned and urgent. 'Why I am not  going to buy a computer' is as cogent a rallying call for the neo-luddite  movement as could be imagined! Berry is an advocate of the local, the real,  the humane, that which is connected to the earth and which knows and loves  its place. Essays such as 'Writer and Region', 'The Work of Local Culture'  and 'Nature as Measure' display a deep-felt commitment eloquently argued.  While Berry writes of the politics of farming, Hemmingway, Twain and Blake  are never far away. Berry's aim is to recall his readers to the wasteland  corporate, industrialised America is becoming and to offer an alternative  vision, one of considerable hope. Too critical to be co-opted into the  ranks of the acceptable voices, too contrary and complex to be labelled  simply an 'environmentalist', Berry's writing is essential 
 Note: this is the edition I'm familiar with, but it's out of print. There are new editions (both with this translation and newer ones) that would be worth checking out. This one has no real guide or preface, but I kind of like that.  Norman Kemp Smith's translation seems to be one of the standard English translations of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Is it the best? I don't speak German, but it's certainly serviceable.  This is a daunting work. It's also a necessary work, inasmuch as any understand of contemporary thought and intellectual history must encounter it. Kant has influenced nearly every major school of thought and cultural trend for the last 200 years. Below, I'll try to sketch his thought in this Critique.  This is the story of Immanuel Kant, who found philosophy a mess and sought to fix it. Specifically, he was a former Rationalist who was disconcerted by the critique of British Empiricism (specifically the skeptical philosophy of David Hume). He sought to provide a grounding for the truths of empirical science and mathematics, establish the possibility of religious faith and practice, while at the same time avoid dogmatism in metaphysical reasoning.  How did he seek to do this? By establishing a critique of reason whereby he understands the validity of all mental constructs. Kant distinguish between judgments which are a priori (prior to experience) and a posteriori (arising out of experience), and judgments which are "analytic" (trivial, tautological) and "synthetic" (where the predicate adds something that is not contained within the subject). Are synthetic a priori judgments possible? Kant answers yes, and much of this book deals with what follows from that.  First Kant deals with how we have sense experience. He claims that space and time are necessary a priori conditions for sense experience -- not physical things in the world. The content of our experience is sense-data: raw sensation that arises outside ourselves or inside ourselves and is "given" in experience. The forms in which we construct that experience are space and time. Sensations, organized within us spatially and temporally yields sense experience (perceptions).  Kant then proceeds to our abstract thought. What he terms "Understanding" has pure, a priori concepts according to logical form. He calls these "Categories." These do NOT arise as a mere empirical habit/convention -- they are prior to experience and are necessary forms that allow rational beings to experience the world intelligibly. Thus, we take the raw givens of our Understanding, which are perceptions (which we dealt with under "Transcendental Aesthetic"), and we impose the categories upon these perceptions -- we "schematize" our experience. Perceptions, given intelligible form according to schemata, yield intelligible concepts. We are justified in doing this because the perceptions are not things-in-themselves, but mere appearances (phenomena), and in order for these phenomena to exist in an experience that is coherent and consistent for us, they must have these forms. We are NOT justified in applying these categories to things-in-themselves (noumena).  This is where Reason eats itself. It tries to do the same thing the understanding did, but now it does this with respect to the big metaphysical questions. It starts with concepts and attempts to unify all phenomenal experience according to concepts and yield the Ideas of Pure Reason. When it does this, it gets all confuzelled. It tries to deal with 3 Big Problems (Kant uses the term "dialectic"):      * Soul - Reason wants to insist that the thinking soul exists, that it is subject (pure substance), that it is simple, and that it is unchangeable through all its activities. These are the Paralogisms of Pure Reason. We need these ideas -- their contraries are unthinkable for us(?), but these are not demonstrable.     * The World - Reason wants to answer questions about the series of appearances that constitute the world: Is the World limited or unlimited in space and time? Is the world made up of simples or composites? Does freedom exist in the world? Is there a necessary being connected with the world? These are the Antinomies of Pure Reason. Unlike the Paralogisms, these questions admit of contradictory answers. They, too, cannot be adjudicated by pure reason.     * God - Reason wants to demonstrate the existence of God. Kant refers to this as the Ideal of Pure Reason. He claims that all arguments demonstating God's existence in fact, despite outward appearances, depend upon one method, the "ontological" proof of God's existence, which Kant disallows as transempirical.   Kant tries to tell us how to employ reason. First, stop arguing speculatively about God, etc.! But he urges us to apply those metaphysical ideas must be employed in practical (moral) contexts. In this, he anticipates the Victorians, who were somewhat skeptical on matters of faith, but stressed the necessity of continuing to act according to traditional morality. The dialectic problems deals with ideas are not verifiable speculatively. They are not constitutive of experience. Rather, they serve a regulative function, specifically in the practical realm of morality.  Kant claims that reason is architectonic: it naturally wants to assume the greatest generality. Kant says this is fine for moral thinking, but bad for speculative thinking.  Kant says that philosophy answers these questions: "What can I know? What ought I to do? What may I hope for?" The bulk of Critique of Pure Reason answers the first question. The Critique of Practical Reason, Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, Metaphysic of Morals, etc., answer the second question. The third question ties the two together -- this is what Kant deals with at the end of the first Critique.  Kant sees the great transendental ideas as being God, Immortality, and Freedom. They are the starting points of theistic religion (e.g. Christianity and Judaism). These can neither be verified nor disproved by speculative reason (since speculative reason must by its nature deal with givens (Latin, data) either from sense-experience or pure intuition (as in mathematics). These ideas, however, are necessary "regulative" ideas for the guidance of practical (moral reason) and are valid in that connection. Thus, the second Critique answers the question "What ought I to do?" by recourse to the transcendal idea of Freedom. The question, "what may I hope for?", is given response through the transcendental ideas of God and immortality, for if God does not exist, nothing can grant us happiness for moral behavior and unhappiness for immoral behavior, and if we're not immortal, God won't have anyone to reward.   I probably have made errors and inaccuracies in the above, but I hope I give a flavor for his thought. Kant is sober, earnest, and disciplined. Again, he's not easy, but I think he's worth the effort 
 In 2005, Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter, Home Alone, etc.) adapted Jonathan Larson's beloved rock opera from stage to film and did a grand job in it. This soundtrack is a product of the music heard in the movie, and it as just as better as ever.   With the usuals returning in 6 of the 8 main parts - Rapp, Pascal, Menzel, Diggs, Martin, and Heredia - there were still 2 parts left open as Daphne Rubin-Vega (Mimi) and Fredi Walker (Joanne) declined.   Fortunatley, this soundtrack features two amazingly beautiful voices from their replacements who many consider are as good, and in my personal opinion are better, than the first two gals. Tracie Thoms plays Joanne with dignity and a range that could knock someone over as she brings the house down with the famous high note in "Seasons of Love." Rosario Dawson (Sin City, Alexander) has the best performance of her career as Mimi, where she can sexily serenade any listener in "Out Tonight" and reduce some to tears in "Goodbye Love."  With most of the highlights sung in this film, some songs are better in this version; while songs here are in its Broadway's parallel's shadow. Then there are some songs on here that do justice to their counterpart and they are both equally good. Some improvments on this track are "Seasons of Love," "Rent," "Without You," "Santa Fe," "Tango Maureen," and "Will I?"  Overall, just go get it. It's amazing. Your ears will thank you 
 Although the story was about Jennings and his bewildering forays into the foster care system, as well as his emotional, intellectual and psychological resilience, the secondary character that puzzled me most was the mother.  There are so many unanswered questions.  Personally I suspect undiagnosed clinical depression and the possibility of other mental illness.  This is definitely a hard-luck family, fractured by poverty, alcoholism, and on the mother's part, an unwillingness? ignorance? about discipline and consistency.  I recommend this book as a teacher; I know that children go through this.  I grew up in a very stable home with both parents, and with a lot of consistency in my life, so this book opened my eyes to other ways of living and what others have to go through to survive and thrive 
 Booked to die is every book collectors and book lovers dream.  It is a fast paced story about a Denver cop who collects books.  It takes you into the shady world of book collecting (who would have guessed?)with the death of a book scout (someone who hunts for cheap books and sells them to a book store for less than retail price).  Cliff believes the death was committed by his nemsis, and Cliff goes off the deep end trying to prove this. Cliff leaves the force and dives into the world of rare and collectible book store owner however he can't let go of that last case.  With mystery, romance and plenty of good books this is a great read that all readers will enjoy 
 Always is an entertaining movie that has a little in it for everyone?  Chick flick?  Sure, but with enough testerone pumping scenes and humor scattered throughout that guys will like it too.  The firefighting scenes at the end can have you at the end of your seat, and the general theme of the movie keeps you interested throughout. A good movie to pick up for movie night at the house or for friends coming over.  
 Dale Rosengarten spent hundreds of hours working on a marvelous exhibit. If you were fortunate enough to have seen the exhibit in Charleston, New York, Columbia or Charlotte, I know you'll agree that it was superb and this book will keep your memory fresh. If you didn't have the chance to see the exhibit and you're interested in the history of Jews in America then this is the book from an exhibit that has sparked a new era of interest by historians to rediscover southern Jewish life from the mid 18th century to the present 
 This is a wonderful collection of patterns that can be completed by scroll sawyers of all skill levels.       Each basket is made by cutting a single layer of wood and then stacking and gluing the layers on top of each other. The end product is  a basket, candydish,  or napkin holder that appears to be woven in the style of those expensive Longerberger baskets now popular on the "Tupperware Party Circut".      I have now completed three of these baskets. The amazing thing is no one has yet been able to figure out how they were made. Even my woodworking friends were amazed by this new technique.       Patterns  for 10 wooden baskets are provided in this 60 page full sized pattern book.  Each pattern is accompanied by a photograph of the finished basket and the book opens with a chapter explaining the entire process through text and photos .       The patterns call for wood between 1/4 and 1/2 inch in depth, but I have successfully made baskets with 1/4 inch plywood and 3/4 inch pine.  The patterns can be enlarged or shrunk on a coppier and wood types and thicknesses can be varied to create a wide variety of objects.       A scroll saw or fret saw is needed to complete these projects 
 From the sparkly pink cover to the fun little games and quizzes, "The Modern Goddess's Guide to Life" satisfies the little girl and the playful woman in me. But something someone else recently said is more eloquent and to the point regarding this book's value. I know of a woman in the Armed forces, recently returned from Iraq, who had the book with her there. She said that, while she was there, Francesca's book helped her take care of herself and also still feel like a woman, neither of which is easy to do when you're in a war. A book that can provide that kind of support in radically difficult circumstances is a great book 
 This is a beautiful story. The author did a reading/slide show of this book at our school several years ago. When the lights came on, there wasn't a dry eye among the parents (and some of the kids)in attendance. I still get choked up when I read this to my children. Its truly a beautiful story. I've bought 6 copies through the years for friends & family when they have children. A must read at Christmas time 
 This book covers in depth the LBO of RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s. Recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew I wanted to go into M&A work, I decided to read it. I thought the book was excellent, but maybe unnecessarily long. The authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation. The two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not, but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless. For someone interested in pursuing a top Wall Street job, this book is a must. For everyone else that just likes good non-fiction, this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era 
 Have you ever had an obsession with money? Well Raspberry has.  I think Money Hungry, by Sharon G. Flake, is a good book.  Raspberry is trying to get money to help her mom that is why I like the book. Raspberry is one of the of the main characters.  She lives in the projects and does not have much money.  Raspberry's mom is another main charter.  She is going out with Dr. Mitchel.  Zora is Dr. Mitchell's daughter and Raspberry's best friend until she does something bad.  This takes place in then projects and at Raspberries school and many more places.  Raspberry is trying tom get money for her mom, but it gets out of hand. I think you should read this book because she is telling the storey and you will begin to feel sorry for her and bad for her that is why I liked Money Hungry by Sharon G. Flake. 
 I was very satisfied with this purchase.  Book was brand new as represented and was shipped in a most epedient manner 
 Putting it simply, this film is the work of a genius. As a Tom Stoppard fanatic, I adored it from the moment I read the play, which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with. He was significantly more satisfied with the movie, and there is very little doubt as to why. He clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working.  Any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film--they may or may not like it, but that's not what matters. This film is amazing 
 Robet Stone has always been a novelst of PLACE. Whether in New Orleans,{HAll of Mirrors},Vietnam and the southwest{dog soldiers},or later Jerusalem{Damascus Gate},he inhabits these places as if he were a lifer. IN a FLAG FOR SUNRISE, his finest work to date, he inevnts a claustrophobic,insane CIA crazed counrty,TECAN.A Graham Greene novel written by a close to the edge survivor,this is a complex political religious thriller. There are some chilling moments early on, a whiskey priest{not a very rare breed, in fiction }a radical nun, a reptillian colonel,a cia agent, his latin american contact, a drug smuggler and his wife[bored, they do this for kicks] a psycopathic meth-amphetamine addict,all cross paths and slowly,slowly they come together. Stone along with Heinrich Boll inhabits the same area in fiction, at least for me: morally compromised people, thrown by situation,fate or grace into out of control situations.Also,like Boll, Stone doesnt like happy endings[knowing that there are few, at least now}. This book is a masterpiece of contemporary fiction,one of the better novels of the last 25 years. Stones best to date, a powerful novel filled with potent mix of religion,politics and philosophy 
 The surprisingly interesting stories in this collection generally range from one-half to three pages in length.  The anecdotes are all cited from other works, lending this collection some credibility despite the poor title.  A great book for a bathroom reader.  
 The book I got has an excelent quality. I recomend it to all the people interested in japanese literature, and of course, I recomend to buy at Amazon.co 
 Though, Jason's Lyric wasn't in the theaters that long, the soundtrack did very well; hit number one on the R&B charts, and peaked at number 17 on the billboard hot 100 in 1994. The soundtrack contained three charted singles; "U Will Know," (A 20 year old D'Angelo wrote and produced the song) featuring vocals from D'Angelo, Tevin Campbell, R. Kelly, Gerald Levert, Tony Toni Tone, El DeBarge, Portrait, Christopher Williams, After 7, Intro, Joe, Brian McKnight, H-Town, Keith Sweat, DRS, Usher, Damion Hall, and Al B. Sure!, "If You Think You're Lonely Now," (a Bobby Womack cover) performed by a (solo) K-Ci Hailey, the soundtrack's finest moment, and the Brian McKnight number "Crazy Love." The soundtrack consists with many G-Funk moments; Twinz "First Round Draft Pick," Ahmad "That's How It Is," Spice-1 "Nigga Sings The Blues," and Five Footer Crew "Walk Away." The soundtrack gets bluesy with Buddy Guy's "This City Needs Help," and also contains a latino rap moment with LSD's "Love Is The Key." Tears For Fears product Oleta Adams contributes a Jimmy Cliff cover "Many Rivers To Cross," in one of the finer moments of the soundtrack, and Los Angeles based bad boys DRS contribute as well. Albert Collins and Mint Condition collaborate, followed up by the smokin' "Just Like My Papa," by Tony Toni Tone. Jason's Lyric is a fine example of a soundtrack that surpassed the film itself, and most artists that contribute never had a finer moment 
 First the good news. This book contains some of Heinlein's most interesting speculations, some of his most delightfully outlandish ideas (there is a cat who really can dematerialize and walk through walls, and enough skewed gender politics and sexual antics to give the book an X rating :-)), some of his most interesting characters (several of them new, and many old, such as Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw), and probably the most well developed presentation of the concept of The World As Myth. Heinlein uses this idea to tie together the different books, such as Glory Road, Stranger in a Strange Land, and The Number of the Beast, that are not a part of his Future History Series, by making them all members of the multiple timeline universe, or multiverse theory, that was discovered by mathematician Dr. Jake Burroughs in The Number of the Beast. It's a brilliant concept that unifies Heinlein's entire oeuvre under one integrating theory of temporal reality.  Now the bad news. The novel is very uneven and much of the action doesn't seem to go anywhere, as Dr. Ames and Hilda get chased from pressure dome to pressure dome on Luna, finally ending up at Time Corps Headquarters in another millenium. Even worse, the ending is possibly the most unsatisfactory of any Heinlein novel as it leaves the entire novel's story and denouement unfinished, perhaps because Heinlein intended to follow the book up with another novel. But as that never happened here it just ends in the middle of the action and there is nothing more to indicate how the story actually ends.   Half way through the book, it takes off in an unexpected direction (although that's part of the fun, since that's where you get to meet all the other characters from past novels), and is where one finally learns that this novel is subsumed under Heinlein's Temporal Multiverse concept. Still, there is little to motivate that based on the previous direction of the book. The hard-hitting, in your face, ultra-cool, smarter-than-you dialog that is one of Heinlein's trademarks, is so ubiquitous in the book so as to make it impossible to distinguish many secondary character's personalities from one another, as they all act and talk and think the same way--which is basically how Gwen Novak and Dr. Richard Ames behave too.   Finally, almost everyone in the book is apparently a completely larcenous, opportunistic, and immoral entrepreneur who would sell his own grandmother to the glue factory if he could get away with it, especially the citizens of Luna, who are proudly anarchistic, and who ardently believe that there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. But apparently that means it's okay to steal someone else's lunch if you can get away with it. After awhile this never ending procession of unrepentent and ebullient scalawags, rogues, and profiteers gets to be a little tedious, and seems to indicate a darkening of Heinlein's views on human nature which first became evident in his novel, Friday.  The novel is still well worth reading for Heinlein fans, but only if you're familiar with many previous characters, concepts, and history from earlier works. At a minimum, this would include Methuselah's Children, The Green Hills of Earth, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Stranger in a Strange Land, The Number of the Beast, Glory Road, and possibly a few more that I'm forgetting. So if you're a newcomer to Heinlein, don't start with this book; start with the many better introductions to his fiction, such as those recommended on several websites developed to his work. If you do a Google Search on his name, you'll turn up several of these. The book assumes too much previous special knowledge to be comprehensible to the Heinlein beginner, and reading this one could turn someone off who might otherwise enjoy Heinlein with a little more knowledge and education.  All that having been said, the book is still worth reading, especially for Heinlein fans, since in this novel Heinlein fully develops the theory of The World As Myth that he introduced in The Number of the Beast. Another strong point, for all those Lazarus Long fans, is that Lazarus has a major role. And in the last part of the book, some of Heinlein's most memorable characters from previous books, such as Jubal Harshaw, Slipstick Libby, Mannie Davis, Rufus and Star (from Glory Road) Hazel Stone, Jake Burroughs, and others appear, and it's fun to have all of them in one place at Temporal Headquarters interacting together 
 More than any other work, this mordantly funny satire reminded me of Italo Cavino's IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAVELLER, which I read over 20 years ago and still resonates in me even more than things I've read more recently.  The episodic incidents, now ending now beginning, seemingly random but knitted together and well worth the effort.  The incredible visual sequencesm the MEMENTO-like jumps and "gaps," the easily recognizable characterizations and the befuddlement of the central character kept me reading and made me reluctant to close this book once I had finished 
 This documentary is one of the finest I have seen.  It chronicles the life and work of Alfred Stieglitz, with reflections by his wife, artist Georgia O'Keefe, and several other important 20th Century American artists and photographers.  The film is illustrated with many of Stieglitz' powerful photographs and demonstrates his singular impact on photography as an art form.  Stieglitz' support and influence on other artists is explored, as are exhibitions of paintings, photography and literary works that he introduced to the public via his New York galleries and his publication "Camera Works". I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEAUTIFUL FILM!! 
 This is my favorite of any jazz DVD I have in my possession.  Branford and gang set off some artistic dynamite in this show!!!  As a saxophonist whose day(and night) job is video production, this DVD has me completely hooked!  Music: 10 Audio/Video Production: 10 Extras: 10  ... so on a scale from 1 to 5, it deserves a 30.  ---  My one complaint: The BGM had me wishing the DVD set had a second disc with tunes other than the "A Love Supreme" portion.  This magic leaves you yearning for an encore! More! More! More 
 I would not call this book a must have for traveling to Paris but it was a handy reference guide to find out what something was on a menu.  It did save me from at least one mistake in ordering something I would not have wanted to eat!  On the other hand, I felt that it was a little high-brow in that the least expensive restaurants were listed as below $25 and, call me cheap, but that is not necessarily budget dining for my family.  We found that drinks were often the most expensive part of our meal and this book does not touch on that at all.  I used Rick Steves' Paris 2003 book much more often than I used this one.  Get both if you can afford it 
 This book was well-paced and I couldn't stop reading the last 50 pages or so (very exciting and nerve-wracking!) The ending (no spoilers here) made total sense and was well-done.  Her characters are pretty well fleshed-out for a thriller---it was not just a script for a movie (which is how I feel about SOME thriller novels), there was certainly depth there.  Not much criticism to offer here, there were a few passages here and there with a bit of clunky writing---(such as using the same adjective twice in one short paragraph) but nothing major.  Definitely recommended for a quick, intelligent read.       
 Received exactly what I ordered at a fair price 
 I'm reading this for the second time, this time for a book club. Jones writes the most nuanced, believable characters. This book is full of information and the clever use of what I believe are imaginary citations gives it additional weight.  I wonder if he did not use some of the facts of the life of Thomas Day, a free black cabinetmaker who was born in southside Virginia and lived and prospered in the small town of Milton, NC.  He is a gifted writer and his Lost in the City (short stories) show the range and depth of his characters. I look forward to many more works by him 
 I own 2 of these - one for each stroller. It is so convenient for keeping my daughter toasty without having to mess with bulky sweaters and coats that will only need removing once we reach our destination. Also saves me the trouble of having to wake her - I can just peel back the top cover, or zip it off altogether. Also, I've received countless compliments on how stylish and practical it is, not to mention water resistent, which is great for Seattle! 
 It is tragic that he isn't more celebrated.  This is one of the best books I have ever read, because it works on so many levels: it is a wonderful pot-pourri of character portraits, it's a revealing examination of  sociological values at work, and it is a marvelous literary work of a  million subtle influences in harmony.  It is, in short, a reflection of the  motion-pictures that made their appearance at the time, and beyond that, is  ripe with biblical allusions wonderfully entwined with the storyline.  Dos  Passos requires the reader to work, and he should be given more credit for  making us do so with so much satisfaction 
 I have always wanted to buy this book but it was a bit expensive for me. Now that I finally got this book, I have been reading it on a daily basis (almost). It's so interesting to read, I actually take it to bed... (-:  The book is providing background information you don't find in other books on ingredients, utensils, knifes and on all the important recepies, cooking technics etc. This book is all I could hope for and more, as I am getting more advanced and serious in my Japanese cooking at home and for family and friends.  That's the right book for you if you are really interested in the Japanese kitchen beyond from just making occasional sushi.  I doughbt that I am going to need another Japanese cooking book in the next few years... This is the real thing!  
 Phyllis A. Whitney was one of my first favorite authors. Back in the day, I could hardly wait for her new releases to show up in my dad's monthly book club mailings. He would always buy them for me because, of course, he wanted to encourage a lively interest in books.  Phyllis Whitney fueled my love of reading then, and now, years later, she fuels my love of writing. Her "Guide to Fiction Writing" covers all of the basics including plot, characters, outlines, research, conflict, suspense, revision, etc. She delves into the craft of writing and expounds on the finer points such as "show, don't tell." The whole book is written in a comfortable, casual style, as though she is having a private discussion with the reader-who she clearly respects as a fellow writer. She's not sitting on a high horse looking down her nose at all of us. It feels more like she's sitting on the other end of the sofa.  What I like best about this book is the way the author projects enthusiasm for the business of writing and stays positive about finding success. "Good fortune and opportunities are always coming along," she writes. "Perhaps opportunity is like a train on an endless track. Now and then it makes a stop at your station, often without fanfare, and without warning...When the breaks came for me I was doing the right thing. I didn't know it was the right thing, but even when there was no opportunity in sight, I was working. You, who may be just beginning: What you do now counts. Never mind the rejections, the discouragement, the voices of ridicule (there can be those too). Work and wait and learn, and that train will come by. If you give up, you'll never have a chance to climb aboard."  Although it was written over twenty years ago, this book is timeless...as is Phyllis Whitney herself 
 Wow.  This set from masters, Lou Donaldson, Big John Patton, Ben Dixon, and Grant Green is truely killer.  Tasty swinging grooves abound and nearly ever song is worth listening to over and over.  I love this disc, and I  would bet you will too 
 I wish the authors had listed the amount of sugar contained in recipes as well as the Total Fat etc.  I swear by the SUGAR BUSTER program and having the sugar content would be so helpful 
 Koning gives a very valid speculation on Columbus' life and voyages.  Thoughout the years, the story of Columbus has been twisted and glamourized, making the people of America believe that he was a hero.   Koning goes in to great detail when explaining the truths behind all these  mythological ideals.  It is an easy read as well as a very good piece of  writing 
 My kids (ages 7 and 5) have loved this book.  They have learned to follow the linear instructions and are so impressed with their ability to create.  We also purchased Ed Emberly's "Make a World".  Both are great for young learners 
 THis is a very well argued book on why the global economic regime as dominated by the West is the best alternative available.  Wolf is a good writer, has worked in international organizations on economic development issues, and is currently economics editor of the Financial Times.  He really goes over the basics here, without excessive resort to math, from how the global economy works, why it in his view is best, and what should be done to improve its performance.  The best thing about this book is that Wolf acknowledges rather than glosses over the problems of inequality, the corruption, poor performance, or deformation of certain international economic institutions, and the critiques of the young.  While his tone is sometimes defensive (he despises Naomi Kline and the young anti-globalists), he makes an honest attempt to argue that there is amply room for improvement in the way the political economy is run.    Wolf's views are very close to my own, so what I got from this book is a solid overview of the issues as they stand at the moment.  I did not need convincing, so this may be more useful for those who are asking basic questions and are more open-minded than myself.    Recommended.  
 A year ago, I was forced to read this book by my english teacher... At first, looking at the cover, (it was red with a picture of a girl) I had an impression that i would not enjoy reading it...   After a couple of days, i was surprised to see myself bringing the book everywhere I go... During break times, lunch, and spend 2 full hours reading it at home...  Reading this diary, made me picture how Anne had her teenage life.. It was really different from mine. Nothing beats how a 13 year old girl manage to live a life like a prisoner in the attic. No other friends to talk too... Same people she sees every single day... In a small place called the "Secret Annexe".   Can you imagine that that kind of life? That you have no idea if you can eat or not, if you should talk or remain silent for the whole day... or if you can still get out of that Annex and live a normal life again... Can you imagine??? But still, they remained hopeful until the last air they breathe...  For me, those people are the real heroes. They never gave up. They sacrificed and united. And best of all, their faith in God reamined strong.  This book influenced millions and millions of people from all over the world. This is a real story of a real world... And the fact that this happens too to so many people. Sometimes we ask, "Why do we need to repeat History?"   Read this book and you'll realize that this is different, worth it and remarkable... 
 I came to the Summons after reading only The Broker, and having seen a couple of Grisham films.   The plot of the book is quite basic - revolving around a law professor's dead father's estate - but contains some interesting twists and turns along the way. There arent a whole lot of characters to get to know, only really 3 or 4 "main" characters, the rest seem to fade into the background, and the Mississippi countryside plays a big role too, as Ray Atlee jetsets back and forth. Atlee's main hobbies in the book seem to be flying a Cessna all over the place and spending large amounts of money in casinos - 2 things I would love to be able to do.  I found the story to be reasonably interesting, as it raised a lot of questions about how Atlee should handle the little extras he found in his father's estate, which were not mentioned in the will. Should he put it in the probate, should he take it for himself, should he split it up? The predicament is interesting, and the outcome of his seemingly altruistic approach does not go to plan.  While the twist in the story is quite unexpected, it is not groundbreaking stuff. Rather, I took it as more of a fable if you like, an example of how the best intentions can look like something otherwise to those outside the thought process.  Overall, I thought it was a short, snappy read. I think that the Broker was a better read than this. If you like the Summons, definitely give the Broker a go. The scenery and characters in the Broker are a bit stronger. But if you like this genre or author, the Summons is definitely worthy of an afternoon or two 
 This maybe Stone's greatest novel.  Certainly it ranks up there with the top 2 or 3.  I've read all of his books and found this one the most affecting.  I cared about the characters and I learned some dark truths.  A  weighty tragedy and some beautiful writing 
 This CD is Exellent it's so chill and cool. If you're into Techno check it out, it's defenately a new kind of soun 
 I think our most decorated war hero was type cast in action films,namely low budget westerns.  He may have been a better actor than that, if given the chance 
 can't say enough about how Music&tv truly come together as one until you go back down Memory lane with these Classic Songs&Some of Musics Greatest Composers are Featured here such as Quincy Jones with "Ironside" theme."Hawaii 5-0","Dallas" etc... Classic themes that also Highlight the Great Shows the Music Came from.enjoy a stroll back down in time 
 I just finished reading this book and WOW!  It was great!  I really had trouble putting it down.  The plot was very convincing and I just loved the ending.  There was a surprise on every page including the last page. As a writer, the two things I was most impressed with (in addition to the wonderful plot) was how Case created such a sense of place - I really felt like I was there in every scene and I could really visualize the space.  I also thought he did such a good job of nailing the dialogue - each character sounded different, one could imagine someone speaking English as a second language, yet it was not difficult to read.  I thought the information about the relics in the Catholic church was especially interesting and also, all the technical cloning stuff made me realize that this entire plot is not so far-fetched.  It would make a great movie 
 I have both all three monster truck, because it was so fun to watch.   
 I bought the 128MB card 8-9 mnths ago. At first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller! Finally it gave a 'Error Reading Card'  message and stopped working. Customer service at Viking was very very helpful and prompt. They replaced the card is 7 days. They also tried to retrieve some of the images that I had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a CD with the images on it! I was impressed with the excellent support, but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life. Would I buy it again? Yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well 
 This book is great fun for anyone interested in math and the derivation of words.  Highly recommended for math teachers.  Don't miss this gem 
 The item was received within the time specifications; and was received in excellent conidtion 
 I love this book! It gave me so much insight on PPD and all the different ways I could help myself and get the professional help I needed. It also helped regain my relationship with my husband! I would reccommend this book to every woman who is pregnant. It's good to know what to look for as far as symptoms go, that way you can get help sooner. I was in denial for several months thinking I would "snap out of it". This IS an illness, and can be treated!! I still have bad days, but they are fewer and farther between. On the bad days I just pick up this book and go to one of the earmarked pages on self help therapy and within a few minutes (instead of hours of crying) I'm feeling better. If you even THINK you might have PPD this is the book to read! It's also great to give to someone who is in denial...they might not appreciate it at the time, but will love you for it later! Good luck to all those women out there going through PPD right now!!! 
 This movie has this sort of eerrie feeling, like something is lurking just beneath the surface and it is, karma, poetic justice,your come upms if you will. I love this movie. This movies teaches you that greed at someone elses expense will come back to you just as you dished it out, but when you least expect it. This movie is funny, timely, and intoxicating. The music lingers in you mind days and even months after you have seen this movie. The characters are the most amazing group of people ever collected to pull off these scenerios. You will absolutely love it 
 I just loved this book. It's filled with useful and interesting information about altar-building from MANY different cultural perspectives. I found the fine art quality of the gorgeous pencil drawings of real-life  altars to be breathtaking. I wish they were available as postcards, with  helpful altar-building tips on the back 
 With the background buzz of bioterror fears nowadays, the biocop world Benson describes is all too believable. The medical disaster unfolding in not-too-future England is drenched with 14th-century foreboding as the plague advances on an unprepared Europe, with a bit of hereditary mystic-medicine to link the two time zones in terror and hope. What's really scary is how hyper-vigilant "modern" society has become, yet the bug is unleashed despite all best efforts. Cool story 
 My name is Rachel and I am 16 years old.  I am a junior in high school and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card was a reading requirement for my English class.  I also love reading outside of school; I do it as much as I can when I have free time.  I have read quite a few science-fiction books as well as many other novels from various genres.  Although we were required to read Ender's Game, I enjoyed it thoroughly and found myself reading way ahead of the class and unable to put it down. 	Although I liked Ender's Game overall as a novel, there were a few components I did not particularly care for.  The plot was somewhat split in two, one half concentrating on Ender's story in space, and the other concentrating on the simultaneous happenings on earth and the story of Valentine and Peter Wiggin.   The issues on Earth, in my opinion, were not explained clearly enough. It was difficult for me to grasp which parts of the world were plotting to attack which others.  Valentine and Peter talk about these issues as if they are "old news" but I seemed to be lost during these conversations. What I did like about the novel was being able to know what was going through Ender's mind at all times.  Reading about Ender's struggles from home, to those from battle school, to command school and beyond and how he overcame every obstacle put in his way was enjoyable for me.  I also found myself very interested in how Ender was given no opportunity to become close with all other students, but he managed to make a few extremely close friends who learned to love Ender despite his uniqueness. Card's writing style, in general, was actually one of the main things that made me like this book. At the start of each chapter, Card uses dialogue among the various adult characters, such as Graff and Anderson, to foreshadow the events that immediately follow.  He also writes in a way that allows the reader to know Ender's thoughts and feelings; most of the novel is written from Ender's point of view.  Card creates a few round characters that we are able to learn a lot about. But he also includes multiple flat characters that we know so little about, but are still critical to the plot. I definitely recommend this book to any fan of science fiction, but I also recommend it to any dedicated reader also, even if sci-fi is not a particular interest.  Young children should probably not read this book because of the complexity of the plot.  It might be hard for them to fully comprehend the different themes and certain specific plot points of the novel at such a young age.  I suggest this to readers that are 14 years of age or older. 
 I have made a few of the dishes and they were easy and came out delish.  Here sauces are easy and versatile and I find myself referring back to this book for easy dinner ideas. A really nice book to have to reference 
 Becareful when you unpack the shelving materials.  There are 8 circular styrofoam spacers on two square sheets of styrofoam that look like packing material.   You could easily damage the styrofoam if you don't notice them.  Other than that, the table was very easy to assemble.  It looks great and seems to be very strong 
 A wonderful easy fun book to read! Perfect book to make you smile and think about all the wonderful things in your own life. I loved these characters and the visit was too short!!! You won't be sorry to pick this book up and add it to your library and I will be making sure to pick up her other books!!  
  D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) deeply troubles me as a white caucasian.  The opening and closing scenes hint at a movie that will make a serious statement against all wars.  And the battle scenes in part one, including hospital recovery, are superb.  This is a movie that has the power to move and enrage audiences 92 years after it was made, so I consider it an important film classic.  I particularly am moved by hero Henry B. Walthall's return home from war to his sweetheart Mae Marsh, the scenes with Abraham Lincoln, and the impeccable re-creation of Ford's Theater on the night Lincoln was shot.  Miriam Cooper and Lillian Gish are also unforgettably poignant. So there is a lot to recommend to even black audiences nowadays, mostly in part one.  If only Griffith had stopped at the 85 minute intermission point, he would have had a true masterpiece.  What on earth was he thinking in the remaining 100 minutes when he turns the movie into infuriating melodrama and the cinema of propaganda?  (The Kino archive print I watched, the definitive one to buy or rent, runs 187 minutes, with color tinting and an orchestra score.)  The Civil War is over, and the black characters are in control (and mostly played by white actors in blackface).  The blacks are in control of Congress, will not let whites vote, and unwittingly kill the lovely (white) Mae Marsh character.  The logical and needed solution, for Griffith, is to have Walthall form the Ku Klux Klan to avenge his sweetheart's death and let the South not be under the power of the evil and all-powerful blacks.  This is when BIRTH OF A NATION becomes the infuriating cinema of propaganda.  I found myself getting all worked up and wanting all blacks on screen to meet a violent death.  When a whole army of KKK riders faces down a whole street of blacks, you cheer for the KKK  to kill all the blacks and restore order.  And they eventually do.  BIRTH OF A NATION is a powerful and important film, despite its disturbing racism, because of its vast scope and its brilliant filmmaking.  It maintains interest for over three hours, has beautifully drawn and heartbreaking white major characters (again, especially, the three women), stunning battle scenes on a movie determined to make a timely statement to end all wars forever, and parallel cutting between blacks and whites in the admittedly exciting climax.  I'm not sure, but I think parallel editing was invented here, along with iris camerawork.  (All you see on screen is a circle or some other geometric shape.)  And there is again the mammoth length--187 minutes, plus intermission--at a time when Keaton was not yet on screen and Keystone was making 20-25 minute slapstick comedies with Chaplin and Arbuckle.  Griffith, with BIRTH, basically invented the modern cinema; and 92 years later we are still arguing over its merits and admittedly finding its pro-KKK climax blood-racingly exciting because of Griffith's melodramatic storytelling.  You are not allowed to cheer for the blacks.  The NAACP will not allow BIRTH OF A NATION to be shown theatrically anymore.  Too bad.  As a white guy I'd love to see it with a predominately black audience.  Fortunately, we can still see it on DVD versions ranging from only 90 minutes, to Kino's definitive 187 minute roadshow version with color tinting and an orchestra score.  Kino also gives us the 1930 chat with D. W. Griffith and Walter Huston on Griffith's intentions with BIRTH; a 25 minute behind-the-scenes documentary; scenes from the roadshow souvenir program; fascinating legal/censorship records; and several Griffith Civil War shorts he made at Biograph Studios before BIRTH.  Watch BIRTH OF A NATION with a sober head, some intelligence, and in the greatest possible print.  92 years later it is a masterpiece of propaganda that still has the power to enrage, excite, disturb, and move modern audiences as few silent films do.  
 Excellent!  It's Dr. Seuss 
 Ruby Bridges is the first movie I've ever wanted to see over and over again. The first time I watched it was in 5th grade. When I saw it, I was really inspired. It shows us all Black women, men, girls and boys can make a difference in this world and do not be afraid of it 
                  I have always believed that the BBC made the finest adaptations for radio and television, and indeed the BROTHER CADFAEL series is no exception; Bert Coules (who most recently adapted Sherlock Holmes for BBC radio) and the fine actor Philip Madoc brought Cadfael to life in three adaptations which are well worth listening to if you can: MONKS HOOD, THE VIRGIN IN THE ICE and DEAD MAN'S RANSOM. However, Sir Derek Jacobi was an excellent Cadfael for television ... even if some of the teleplays didn't quite follow the plot of the original novels. Acorn Audio did something quite extraordinary when they turned the audio tracks of the four teleplays of the first Cadfael TV series into an audio series, adding a narrator to fill in the gaps and adding some slight commentary on the action which could not be seen on an audiotape; in doing so, they tightened up the narrative to keep the stories moving at a good clip so that the listener would not lose interest, and Stephen Flynn's narration is well-read and well-written. This story brings Brother Cadfael's pre-cloistered past back to haunt him while he struggles to both solve a murder and protect the son of his former love and has enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the viewer (or listener in this case!) rivetted, and I have to say in this recording's favor that the telepay follows the book very closely, more so than many of those in the TV series. I am sorry that Acorn Audio hasn't adapted the rest of the televised Cadfael stories into this format, and the only grievance I have is that the cast of characters is not read out at the end of each story (all we get to know is that Sir Derek Jacobi plays Brother Cadfael, when there are some fine actors in each of the stories). This is something entirely new, coming somewhere in between actual radio drama and books-on-tape, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the Brother Cadfael series. The listener will not lose anything by not seeing the action on a TV screen, and the acting you will HEAR combined with the narration will definitely provide an ejoyable listening experience 
 I was moderately optimistic that the third book of the Christ Clone Trilogy, Acts of God by James BeauSeigneur, would continue to improve much like the second title improved over the first.  Fortunately, it did, and I can say it wasn't a waste of time...  The seven year tribulation period is nearing the end, and Christopher Goodman (the Christ clone) has truly become the anti-Christ.  He is leading the world in rebellion against God and his followers, and the ante to refuse the mark continues to climb.  Robert Milner, Goodman's "prophet", is posing as the person responsible for stopping the judgements being sent down upon the earth.  Goodman's last effort to rid the earth of religious zealots is culminating in an attack on the Petra enclave, where most of the Jewish believers are holed up.  All the armies of the earth are converging on that single spot with hopes to usher in the new millennial age.  Meanwhile, Decker Hawthorne, Goodman's guardian when he was younger, is starting to question the motives and reality of Goodman's rule, and he disappears for an extended period of time.  While hiding out, he starts to read Revelations and understands what is really going on.  This leads to a personal confrontation in Goodman's office with an unfortunate ending...  As I mentioned in the first book review, I wasn't real excited after the initial installment.  But at the urging of friends, I kept going.  Book two was better, and started to bring together the story line that I was expecting.  This final episode was a great read, and stands up well against other "end times" series such as Left Behind.  The Goodman character had some twists I didn't expect, and it forced me to think through some scenarios that I hadn't thought about before.    All in all, a good series.  Definitely a case where you should commit to reading them all, and not be put off by a slow start.  It does get better, and it ends very well.. 
 This young man's adventures in a Turkish prison are simply fascinating, and told very well.  This book is one of the few that I was sincerely sorry that it had to end.  My only complaint is that it is a little too slick, a little too Hollywood-ready.  It would be interesting to read an account that showed a little more of the warts-and-all detail of the experience.  It's a pity that this is out of print.  And in answer to one of the reviewers comments below about what this book says about Turkey, well, in my opiniion, this book is an attack on Turkey.  The author has almost nothing good to say about Turkey, and he never loses an opportunity to slag it off.  But I am definitely interested in finding books that portray modern Turkey, and other countries in this region, in a more positive light.  There never was a region that more needed reabilitating in the world's eyes, than the middle east today, I believe.  Another good reason to read this book is to show the difference between it and the popular film that was made of it.  It was quite an eye opener to me to find that two of the most horrific and lurid episodes that occur in the movie, do not occur in the book, most notably, the disgusting tongue-biting-off sequence 
 I enjoyed this book very much and am enjoying the whole series...Thank You 
 Chatman's book has been around for a while, but it is still probably the best summary of structuralist narrative theory out there.  Chatman makes the very important connection beetween narrative theory and its rhetorical effects on audience.  His treatment of the construction of time in narrative summarizes several other prominent narrative theorists, but his terminology is perhaps the most useful.  His clear presentation of the distinction between "story" and "discourse" (often called "l'histoire" and "recit" after Genette) and the linking of discourse to rhetorical theory is perhaps the book's most useful feature.  Chatman, whose early works included a treatise on poetic meter, is known primarily as a film theorist, but his work analyzes narrative in many media and in many forms.   I have used this book as an introduction to narrative theory in my classes 
 James Frey's new book, "My Friend Leonard" is every bit as good if not better than "A Million Little Pieces".  It captures you from the beginning to the end, filling you w/wonderment on how good the rehab is going....................a book to pick up and not put down until the conclusion 
 I don't know what the other reviewers are thinking.  Buy Boxcar Racer and Sum41 instead?  You have to be kidding!  This album is great with Millencolin's FINGERS CROSSED, THE WORLD by Pennywise, BACK TO OLYMPIA by NOFX and Guttermouth's MY GIRLFRIEND.  Not one bad song on Punk-O-Rama 7, and it's only six dollars 
 From what I've read, it seems like a lot of readers bought this just for the King novella.  While King's short novella excellent, I highly recommend you read all the others, too.  There's a lot of good material in this big book 
 I'm not really one for writing this sort of thing, so I'll keep it short.  The book is a wonder, and made a week-long business trip that promised to be endless and dull pass like half an hour on a beautiful 1930's train, rushing through the Alps, with a mysterious, charismatic passenger in the seat just across from mine.  Part thriller, part continental romance, I recommend this book for anyone who has a heart (with half a brain attached to it) 
 Exciting and highly entertaining story about 3 men who travel to the centre of the earth through an extinct volcano. Here they come across prehistoric forests, a giant subterranean sea inhabited by prehistoric marine dinosaurs, and some ancient offshoots of man. Although some of the science bits are outdated, implausable and sometimes drag a little, the book is still surprisingly modern and fresh after 140 years. Maybe the first adventure novel of this kind and certainly of influence on modern culture. 
 This is a super book for kids of all ages.  Kids everywhere can learn about different kinds of doughnuts 
 The book gives basic info on a lot of how-to projects. Sometimes it does get a little basic but overall I thought it was great. THe tips in the book are awesome. I gave it to a college student who absolutely loved it. Its probably a handy book to keep at anyone's house 
 "Strange Fits of Passion" is definitely one of Shreve's best books.  I have read all of her novels and became lost in all of them, with the exception of "Eden Close" which left me feeling as if the book was a waste of time.  The plot in "Strange Fits of Passion" is definitely not an original one.  An abused wife runs away from home with her infant daughter, finds friendship and acceptance in a rural town in Maine where she lives in a cottage by the sea, in constant fear of her husband finding her.  The climax is fairly predictable from early on in the book, but there is something haunting about Shreve's writing that keeps the reader's interest from start to finish.  Shreve has a unique writing style and the themes of her books stay with you after the pages have been read. The reader feels a part of it all - the fear, love, passion, sadness and joy the characters in her novels portray.  Great book, easy read 
 It stars Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland, with a number of other notable actors pitching in their notable talents such as: Dan Hedaya, Brooke Shields, and Brittany Murphy, oh, and you can't forget the brief, but sincere performance by Bokeem Woodbine.  TO THE MOVIE!  It uses the story structure of little red riding hood and changes the wolf into a real man in this movie who just so happens to also be a rapist, murderer and pedophile.  As you can tell the story has now become quite adult in it's telling and is not for kids as the rating would let you know. TO THE TITLE OF MY REVIEW!  Yes, this is an artsploitation movie meaning that it actually has artistic goals and it obviously has some dirtier ones as well, but what makes most of the film compelling is the performance by Reese Witherspoon who makes the films highs and lows poignant even when they're outlandishly warped and humorous in a dark way.  There are times when the film fails at its attempts by going for too much, and at other times it hits hard and accurately.  This is not a perfect, or consistent film, but it is entertaining in a very askewed way.  When this film was supposed to be released in the United States the company that made it balked at putting it in theatres thinking that it wouldn't find an audience, which may be true because of its outlandishness, however, it wasn't given a chance.  It had a very short one or two week run at one theatre and was rushed to video.  Even Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times was surprised at the corporate decision since he felt Witherspoon's performance in this film was one of the breakout performances of that year. Well, you can't keep a good woman down and she broke through with another movie and continues to do good work, but I don't she'll be able to top this movie because the roles she's taking now are based on her star power and are mainstream vehicles.  She's supporting kids now and I don't think she has the latitude, or time to accept these roles that are far more marginal in appeal and risky, but I'm glad that she made this film and in a strange way I'm glad that the film didn't make money at the box office so I could purchase it for $5 at Best Buy and be surprised at how good it was.  If you are an easily offended person of good taste in film, don't watch the movie, if you're a mainstream person seeking out Reese films, don't watch it.  If you're a casual film watcher looking for a feel good film, don't watch it.   If you're a person who likes dark humor and doesn't mind a movie that takes big chances with its action  and/or you like to see every single movie of a movie star to see if they were always so...streamlined, than this is the film for you 
 It's hard to believe that this novel was written twenty-four years ago. At that time hardly anyone had heard of the World Wide Web and 'punks' were people like Billy Idol.  This is not only a Dystopia but also the first artificially constructed "inner world".  If you can't leave your 21st century mind behind you then you will never understand this book.  It's like reading 1984, Fahrenheit 451 or Animal Farm without the benefit of knowing anything about Fascism, Dictatorship or Stalinism.   This book is to Science Fiction (created a whole new genre) what "Sargeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" was to 1960's music.  It was a hard 90 degree turn and no one was sure where it was leading.  When you watch a movie like "Metropolis", it's almost comical in it's simplicity, but when you watch it in the context of the 1930's and understand that it was "cutting edge" at it's time, it becomes a whole new movie.  After having viewed all of the "Matrix" movies, you will probably find this book to be overlong, pedantic and preachy; but you will miss the point that it was the first of it's kind and that Gibson had to explain so much of what he was building here.  Imagine trying to write a book in the seventeenth century about the 21st and having to explain automobiles, cell phones, Interstate Highways, woman's freedom, etc.     
 R.T. Naylor has a better understanding of illicit markets, than most regulators have. He has obviously done extensive research, on the mechanics of money laundering for example, and knows the legitimate banking system, as well as the underground financial system. I suspect his thesis that organized crime is a myth, may be quite controversial. Nonetheless, he backs up his statements with convincing arguments. The only reason, I did not rate this book 5 stars, is that he slips in his political viewpoints, that are decidedly left of center. As an example, when speaking of Republican congressman Henry Hyde's attempt to reform how banks report questionable transactions to the government, he states, "And for a time, Representative Hyde shifted his energies to more pressing matters, leading the abortive move to impeach Bill Clinton-not because Clinton had gutted the social welfare system, capitulated to the medical establishment on health care, or committed mass murder in Iraq but because of his idiosyncratic taste in custom flavored cigars". (pp.277)These types of gratuitous statements, while rare in this book, take away some of the force of the dilemma most Western countries face in dealing with an underground economy. Still, this is an excellent book, that reads like a college textbook, with priceless insights on offshore banking, money laundering, the underworld gold economy, crime control, and other topics. I strongly suggest this book, as a social commentary of the black market and undergorund economy 
 What fun!  A big aquarium exhibit is coming to Tidmouth and the docks are hustling and bustling with activity.  Cranky the Crane is unloading Bulstrode.  Harvey is loading small crates of aquarium glass, while James and Salty are busy with their own tasks.  The only problem is, Thomas wants to help and he keeps getting told that he is too small to be of assistance.   Sad because he can't find a job `his size', Thomas is about to head back to the Station when he comes across Salty with a huge, toothy shark in a see-thru tank.   Surmising Thomas' sad state, Salty takes pity on Thomas and tells him that small engines **can** be useful, which is exactly what Thomas finds out.  When Percy is surprised by the shark in the tank, he loses control and runs right into Henry who then crashes into Harvey's freight car.  This accident is so noisy and unexpected that Cranky gets spooked and drops a crate of seaweed on James, causing James to go off the track.   As we say at our home, everything was goomeywammered.  And to make matters more complicated, the docks are such a scene of chaos that none of the large engines can move about.  They are just too *big*.  On cue, in comes Thomas.  He steps up and because of his smaller size, he is `Just The Right' engine to clear up the whole mess.  The story ends with everything back to normal and everybody waiting in anticipation for the big exhibit to open.  Five Stars.  Good Read-aloud.  This book has good artwork (versus the photos that are taken from the TV show).  Steamies abound.  So many that almost any Thomas fan should be content.    Our small blue friend gets to be a hero.  This confirms for small fry that you don't have to be big to be helpful.  This book can even be used to help children to understand that no matter how big a mess is made, if everyone pitches in to help together, that mess can be cleaned up 
 What a pity that this album wasn't recognized as the work of art that it is.  Granted the highlight of 'Masterpiece Theatre' is the aptly titled "Love Suite", however the rest of the album does not fail to deliver high quality, intricate vocals and funky beats.  This album is a classic and possibly one of the best albums in music history.  A bold statement?  Absolutely.  True?  Without a doubt.  'Masterpiece Theatre' was the first of it's kind, an album that tells a love story while fusing R&B with classical compositions.  One can easily look around and see either how this album had been used as a catalyst for other artists to go the same route; mixing the two genres or using the concept of telling a story through their album.  These other artists would later go on to sell millions in part because of the help from their record label.  This is album is possibly the one that showcases En Vogue's vocal abilities the best and reaffirms what set's En Vogue apart from other girl groups - past and present.  This album is a magnum opus!  Producers Foster/McElroy did a genius job of conveying the emotion of each song by using specific instruments and vocal arrangements, and directing them in a way that pulls the listener in and has them experience the emotional intensity of that song.  The album has humor, variety and harmony.  It's bold and very unique.  Had it had better backing from the record label, `Masterpiece Theatre' could have easily sailed into a snug place between platinum and multi-platinum status.   Due to the records label lack of marketing and promotion for this album, many who would have appreciated it overlooked it.  `Masterpiece Theatre' is daring, challenging, innovative, and intricate while remaining accessible to the masses.  R&B beats with Classical sonatas is hot!  It works, and it works well.  This album needs to be re-released on a new record label that is willing to put the marketing and promotion resources behind this jewel.  `Masterpiece Theatre' (specifically the "Love Suite") is a gem waiting to be discovered and should have the chance to be heard by a much larger and global audience.  It is still relevant, excitable and scorching even today - six years after it's release.  This is a must-have album!  Masterpiece indeed 
 The media, always groping for sound bites to make generalizations more palatable, grabbed the title of Coupland's first novel and ran with it like an Olympic torch. Henceforth, anyone born between the late 1950s and the early 1970s were dubbed "Generation Xers". Obviously this media hype boosted the novel's visibility to heights it may otherwise not have reached (the book had difficulty finding a publisher in Coupland's home country of Canada). It also created a rather false generalization of its own. One based on a misunderstanding of a literary device. Fiction may have created fiction in this case.  Coupland claims that he never intended to speak for his own, or any, generation in this book. He took the "X" in the title from Paul Fussell's hilarious and intentionally inflammatory book "Class". In its final chapter, called "The X Way Out", Fussell discusses people who attempt to evade the rigid American class system. These people attempt to work outside this system and avoid, in Fussell's words, "...some of the envy and ambition that pervert so many." Arguably, Coupland's "Generation X" presents portraits of three "X people": Andy, Dag, and Claire (Coupland uses this phrase only twice in the book in tandem with the Japanese phrase "shin jin rui" or "X generation" which represents a generation "purposefully hiding itself"). They have escaped (though not completely) by moving to Palm Springs and working less ambitious jobs than their school mates. They also share stories with one another on a regular basis. Why they do this gets printed explicitly in the following passage from the book's first chapter: "Either our lives become stories, or there's just no way to get through them." Throughout the book Coupland contrasts these "X" characters with those still struggling with "the system" (such as Claire's obsession Tobias, Elvissa's friend Curtis, and Andy's brother). Plot isn't really the point here. The novel represents more of a character study of the "X people" more than any exercise in roller coaster narrative adventurousness. The book's major highlights come from the stories told by the characters. The book's ending packs some emotional surprises. Did Andy finally find, out on that field, a meaningful moment in and of itself? Do Claire and Dag (and soon Andy) really escape "the system"? And does it matter? The book does raise some good questions. And overall it's an entertaining read.  The book also experiments with the presentation of the traditional novel. Definitions or neologisms line the margins of the novel like medieval gloss. Term such as "McJob", "Veal Fattening Pen", "Conspicuous Minimalism", "Bread and Circuits", and "101-ism" dot the story and give a text-book or anthropological feeling to the text. Apparently the book intends to instruct as well as entertain. Cartoons (some looking like a hybrid of "Mary Worth" and Roy Lichtenstein) and diagrams add spice to the look of the book, as well as provide a pictoral context for some of the chapters and stories. The overarching picture gets painted not only with text but with pictures and definitions. Though this approach is refreshing, it can also be distracting at times. But overall it adds to the fun of the book.  The one place Coupland may have gone too far was with the statistics at the end. They shove the message down the reader's throat a little too strongly. Especially following the moving ending of "the story" that precedes them. Placing these figures in the margins throughout the text (or in the white spaces at the end of chapters) would have probably lent more subtlety to the numbers (though "subtle" doesn't describe this book at all).  "Generation X" had an impact (regardless of its literary status, which remains controversial). It represents a great first novel, and it's very fun to read. Some may find it cynical, or loaded with youthful idealism or unproductive dropout-ism. And maybe they're right. Or not. Either way, the reader has to ultimately decide on the value of the content and message of the text. But in the end, the book "Generation X" represents more than a mere media catch-phrase

 Gene Wilder, like a lot of comics, has a sober side that is their "real person" rather than their "personality".  You expect a comic to be a wild and crazy guy, but they barely speak a word.  Often time a comic becomes one because they are trying to battle their inner demons, and Gene, like a lot of us, decided that they were going to laugh or blow their heads off.  Here in this rather unconventional biography, we meet Gene the man rather than the personality.  We hear about his experiences in therapy, which years ago was only whispered about rather than expressed publicly.  His two previous marriages were a mystery, but his honestly was refreshing.  His marriage to Gilda Radner was the obvious highlight, but it was a troubled marriage as well.  Gilda was insecure as well, and when two people of obvious talent as well as flaws get together, it's obvious that it can be a recipe for as much disaster as much as it can be magic.  They were a good match though, their happiness was tragicly cut short by her bought with ovarian cancer.  Gene himself would suffer from cancer, but he pulled through.    It's a story about survival and overcoming all the tragedies of life.  And sometimes, all you can do is laugh at them, and that's what Gene chose to do.  Good for him 
 We started our collection with 'not my Kitty' and 'not my puppy', we added 'not my bunny' at Christmas time, my 18 month old LOVES these books, she brings them to us to read to her and will also sit and 'read' them solo, we've invested in 6 more. Another great book, not by the same author is 'Tails' 
 The original Metallica: James Hetfield (Vocals, Rhythm Guitar), Cliff Burton (Bass Guitar), Lars Ulrich (Drums) AND DAVE MUSTAINE (LEAD GUITAR)!!! Most of the leads and riffs you'll hear on Kill 'Em All were written by Dave Mustaine which is why the 1st Metallica album sounds more like a Megadeth record than any other Metallica record. Kirk Hammett stepped in admirably to fill Mustaine's huge shoes but one is only left to wonder, if Mustaine had stayed in Metallica would they be the running joke that they are today? Probably not. Anyway, Kill 'Em All is a flawless rundown of Metallica classics from The Four Horsemen to Motorbreath to Seek and Destroy, the riffs just keep coming. Of all the Metallica albums, this is the one that I listen to the most. Some critics and fans may say that their subsequent albums (Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning) are better but to me this is the truest representation of what Metallica was meant to be. An absolute must-own classic! P.S. Why would they reissue this album and omit two of it's strongest tracks (Blitzkrieg and Am I Evil)?!?!?!?!?  Tracks rated 1-10: 1. Hit the Lights (9.5/10) 2. The Four Horsemen (11/10) 3. Motorbreath (9/10) 4. Jump in the Fire (10/10) 5. Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth) (9/10) 6. Whiplash (10/10) 7. Phantom Lord (11/10) 8. No Remorse (9.5/10) 9.

 Ordered the product over a week before Christmas with express delivery.  Didn't get the package until Dec 29th.  Did get an email on the 25th telling me the were about to ship the product, Merry Christmas!  Don't recommend this company if you need the product quickly.  
 This is an excellent book with a lot of helpful information.  The experiences it shares are excellent.  It is also extremely well written 
 Anything you purchase in the Left Behind Series is an excellent read.  These books are great and very close to the Bible.  I have the entire set.  Amazon is a great shopping site and they ship fast.  I would recommend these to any Christian wanting to know about what to expect during the Return of Christ!  They are Fiction but still makes a good point 
 Very durable, great to have on road trips.  We took it on a 12 hour trip to Miami & the battery life was great.  Both my 1 1/2 year old and my 6 year old play with it.  It gets thrown around a lot and its still kickin like it was brand new.  I highly recommend 
 Probably the best mystery author I have ever read.  Great mix of mystery and history.  The dynamics of the family are interesting to watch as well.  Emilia is hilarious and Ramses is fantastic in his role but why does Emerson have nothing to say but "hell and damnation"?    Overall-Good story.   
 Could someone explain why this has the explicit lyrics tag?  I would like to know if this is particularly offensive prior to purchase, or if there are certain tracks which may be offensive 
 Scott Ritter and Seymour Hersh have made at least two appearances at The New York Society for Ethical Culture in the past year to discuss US foreign policy issues concerning Iraq and more recently Iran.  The October 16, 2006 appearance covered the issues of Mr. Ritter's current book Target Iran.  Transcripts and podcasts are available.  It is Mr. Ritter's contention that the Busch administration's primary tool of foreign policy is that of regime change.  Any efforts by those nations that are so targeted to engage us in diplomacy have and will be rebuffed.  This administration will not talk to those it considers it's enemies.  This has been challenged in the media by the James Baker group, but it remains to be seen if they will effect any changes.  Target Iran, according to Mr. Ritter, in based on press coverage in the Middle East and private confirmation of those stories by members of our intelligence community.  The story is that America is already working inside Iran with dissidents to identify targets.  We are also said to be negotiating the details of staging areas for our base of attack for this widening of the Middle East war.  Once that is completed, this administration intends to attack.  The public is and will be sold the same scenario in which (ala Downing Street memo), the facts will be fixed around the policy.  Why will this happen?  One element is the influence of Israel.  Iran is perceived, and not incorrectly, as a major threat to Israel.  But Ritter makes the point that Israeli and American interests are not identical.  After the recent events in Southern Lebanon, watching our congress and our administration give their complete support to whatever Israel was going to do, it's hard to see much separation.  Whatever the threat to us from Iran, Mr. Ritter says it's very much overblown at this point and should not lead to war.  Iran, according to Ritter, approached this administration several years ago to normalize relations and limit it's nuclear research.  They were rebuffed.  Mr. Busch can only visualize regime change.  If this goes forward as Mr. Hersh and Ritter both seem to think is inevitable, what are the chances of success?  According to these gentlemen, the results will be utter catastrophe.  Iran will immediately shut off the oil spigot.  Venezuela will create a hemispheric crisis by acting in sympathy and fail to honor their US contracts.  US troops in Iraq will be under attack by the Shia and possibly because of a religious fatwa in response to our attack.  Iranian missiles will be directed against the Saudi oil fields to further disrupt the world markets.  The world economy will be plunged into a massive recession.  This could lead to a ground invasion of US troops most likely from Uzbekistan that could easily turn into a trap.  Our ground troops are seriously depleted and under equipped at this point already.  Here is where Ritter says this administration could use field grade nuclear weapons to break the back of Iran.  He thinks this is the ultimate deal breaker because it absolutely assures us that radical Arabs will find a way over time to deliver a nuclear bomb to an American city.  These scenarios seem outlandish, except there are so many radical Republican sources cheering on war with Iran, that one cannot expect this administration to not once again respond with a military solution as the first order of business.  Of course, they visualize success not the failure predicted by Ritter.    The massive failure of our government during Katrina and the fiasco in Iraq are both symptoms of the same problems in the Busch administration.  What if war with Iran leads to the doomsday scenario that Ritter and Hersh talk about.  This book is a sober assessment of these issues and should be read widely by the public.    The potential of a Democratic House of Representatives in the near future will not change the scenario described by Ritter.  American militarism is ascendant.  As Ritter says, if the war in Iraq were going well, the public would be very satisfied.  The fact that the war is against all tenets of international law and was an immoral act on our part is not something that most of us seem to worry about.  Too many Democrats only talk about running a competent war 
 The entire Star Wars saga doesn't and never will have an equal. This book picks up on the things that you might not have in the movie. If you're a dedicated fan, you may be disturbed by the fact that the dialect isn't quite the same as the movie :) If you want to know what happened in the missing moments with Biggs, this is the best way to find out. A wonderful edition to your Star Wars collection, if you can manage to get your hands on it 
 This is a great copy of Vol. 2 of A la recherche du temps perdu [In Search of Lost Time] or [Delving into Things Past].  Each volume in the septrology may be read individually as an independent novel.  This is, of course, the very best translation available in English; probably the very best that will ever be available in English: certainly the next best thing to reading the original French.  Note: Proust is not quick reading, and one who tries to read too quickly will just as quickly lose the tread of the narrative.  This text has its own time scale, and the reader must adjust his/herself to the text--not the other way around.  In this stream of consciousness narrative, the narrator (/author) digresses as he speaks (/thinks): he digresses, digresses, digresses; and then, he returns, returns, returns to the point where he began.  One has to follow his line of thought: this is the art and beauty of the text.  Proust's achievement is one of the greatest edifices of Western art, perhaps comparable only to Wagner's Ring cycle 
 The FS608 I received from Amazon was not the older larger model pictured (to my great relief, since I am tight on space).  The new model looks almost the same but now it's only 16 cm wide x 9 cm deep--as though they put it in a shrinking machine.  It doesn't weigh 3 kg, either!  It did not include the stand described in the earliest review from 2002 
 I'm surprised by how often I turn to this cookbook, but I shouldn't be. The two authors are household words, and they earned their reputation by making "fine cooking" accessible.  Like the PBS show on which the cookbook is based (but don't worry if you missed it), this book is a professional repartee between two accomplished cooks who have been comfortable friends for decades. And that "chemistry" shows through in marvelous ways. The book is fun, entertaining, and educational to read... oh yeah, and it has great recipes, too.  Each author takes a different riff on the same theme, whether it's meat stock or salmon. Even when they don't supply two "competing" recipes, they offer notes on each others' techniques. For example, Julia's notes alongside Jacques' onion soup discuss the importance of cooking the onions properly and thoroughly; Jacques talks about ways to create variations on the recipe.  There are some brilliant recipes in this book, which range from the simple but elegant (salmon cooked inside thin layers of potato, which alone is a reason to spring for a mandoline), to the time consuming but easy (the best pot roast recipe I've ever encountered is in here), to the "gosh we should make that someday" fantasies (will I ever bone a turkey?!) to the deliriously simple but absolutely reliable. The last category include Jacques' vinegarette recipe and how to make it to last in the fridge. Sure, I must have 40 vinegarettes, but I always know that _this_ one works.  I haven't made every recipe here (though it's a goal I might enjoy), but every single one of them is a success. And with excellent food photography, you can follow the food's process from cutting up a chicken to the glorious result. The recipes are a mixture of American and French, encompassing everything from the aforementioned pot roast to steak au poivre to stuffed artichoke bottoms. They range from sandwiches (even your basic hamburger) to sauces (this is the Hollandaise recipe I use) to a turkey galantine (which I love reading about but would never have the nerve to try).   I absolutely love this book. I think you will, too 
 Bernard Malamud is known for creating deeply flawed characters with strong ideals, and Seymour Levin - known interchangeably as S, Sy, Seymour, Levin and Lev - the central character in this wonderful novel, is no exception. A thirty year old masters graduate, down on his luck, but with the backing of an NYU education, he lands a job as a college instructor in the English department of a fictional mid-western state (Cascadia) college. This opens up an interesting cast of characters who view him with a mix of interest, disinterest, partly an inferior, an activist/idealist (his beard suggests he is a radical in the year 1950 in the midst of red-baiting and community suspicion), a potential threat, an alien, an anomaly.   Levin, "formerly a drunkard" (to quote the author) has deep seated problems and issues of self worth. He is a plain man, though definitely an idealist; however, one gets the sense early on that his idealism comes less from a passionate, inward set of convictions and more from a sense of inferiority, and a desire to find meaning in ideas. His activities and how quickly he reacts to the new environment are fascinating - he wastes no time getting inappropriately involved with a female student, sleeping with the wife of a trusting colleague or getting embroiled in the politics of the English department (here Malamud provides an interesting look at a college in a conservative town that values professional training at the expense of literature and learning) and being drawn into a myriad of ethical and moral dilemmas. Without spoiling the plot any further, Levin breaks every conventional rule in the book - this makes him less a sympathetic character and more someone the reader is almost glad to see suffer the fate he does. I would not have felt this way if I got the sense that Levin was fighting for something and doing it sensibly - while I love literature, the way Levin goes about seeking its elevation seems foolish and misguided. Perhaps more about ego and an attempt to feel worthy than out of a true love of books.   This is in essence something of a morality tale, and if I had to get to the heart of what Malamud is saying here it would have to be that misplaced idealism - without moral or ethical standards - will destroy the person within. I found it to be both gripping and bleak at the same time, but surely one of my favorite Malamud novels (and I have now read them all, so will have to find a new author to stalk!).   It seems that from the sparseness of the reviews here and from the seeming lack of recognition this book has received, it is one of his least known works. That is a shame because the characters and plot are fascinating; the themes are timeless (suspicion of someone who looks different, moral bankruptcy, clash of conservatism and radicalism, status quo versus change) and the writing is very good 
 What a wonderful idea this author had.  It's the most creative idea I've read in a New Millennium book.  This is one of those "sleeper" books that the world seems to be passing by.  I hope it gets discovered soon.  It's an excellent book, full of twists and turns ... and a surprise double ending that made my head swim.  Highly, highly, highly recommended.  If you miss this one, you'll be missing the read of a lifetime. - Reviewed by: Harold Hortensky, newspaper reporter/Windy Cit 
 I feel the book is very important to me because i need a very useful method to improve my reading skill,and i am also very interested in how to educate my son in a super way.It's time for us to have a great learning  revolution 
 Well done for the great and wonderfull DVD collection.   I have bought both sets namely Hyacinth in full bloom and Hyacinth springs eternal,  I cherished all the films with great amusement and laugh. I suggest this series to everybody who likes British comedy at its best.   However and may I be subject to correction,  Where is the episode THE ROLLS ROYCE which I assumed is in series five?   I don't know the answer why its lacking and I think its a great pity not having it in my set, perhaps someone could anser my question.  But all in all great series great crystal clear dvd and very good sound as well. Buy all I recommend 
 This book wasn't the greatest book I've ever read, but I had huge expectations for it because the only reason I read it was because the "Modern Library" list ranked it #1, but I still thought the book was very good.  I wasn't familiar with Henry Adams and didn't know why I should care what he did during his life, but the further I got into the book the more interesting it became.  I've been traveling through Europe for a year and thought that Adams and I shared similar opinions about traveling and other things about Europe, so that was interesting due to the large time gap.  But I enjoyed the story because I thought it was an interesting depiction of America, Europe and how one has difficulty understanding the world and the challenges one experiences during life.  A book worth reading 
 I shy away from thick books like this one. But when I started reading GRAND SLAM I was drawn in and knew I would go the distance. The author has done an amazing research job and the characters all come to life. American history is also woven into the story in an interesting way that enlarges the scope of the book. True, I didn't know a lot about Bobby Jones so this was, in a sense a primer for me. It also filled in my knowledge of other golfers at the time such as Walter Hagen.   An interesting side note is that, as Mark Frost points out, East Lake Country Club, in Jones' native Atlanta, was an incubator for golfing talent. Besides Jones, another golfer, the longest hitter, Mike Austin, practiced at East Lake Golf Course during that time. His story is told in the fascinating book IN SEARCH OF THE GREATEST GOLF SWING.   The only omission from GRAND SLAM is a more detailed analysis of Jones's swing. What made him such a great ball striker? Also, the book gets into idol worship at times. But the author certainly makes his case convincingly. Read it -- you'll be glad you did. 
 This recording of the Robert Fagles translation of the Odyssey, while enjoyable in itself, provides a wonderful partner for the text. Sir Ian McKellan's performance is clear, offering a stimulating interpretation without "doing the police in voices." While McKellan is not slavishly faithful to Fagles' prosody, he captures Homer's energetic movement and clarity of depiction.  
 What a great movie! It brings back lots of memories. Good family fun with no off color jokes or violence. The animation is pretty great 
 Massachusetss MC Mr. Lif tears through 7 innovative tracks fortified by various underground dwellers such as Fakts One, paWI, EL-P of Company Flow and Spilled Acid Productions(check the stellar "Pulse Cannon").  He also teams up with several independent mic-rippers such as Akrobatik, Insight, and T-Ruckus to create an overall pleasing EP.  Lif's unique, raspy vocals filter through the mic ever-so-perfectly, his apocalyptic B-Boy stance makes a true underground enthusiast drool on his/her backpack.  Big up.  Highly recommended.  Peace 
 This is the ultimate book in understanding the importance of breaking free from the lesser of two-evil mentality.  Journey with the Nader 2000 presidential campaign through all the obstacles the two-party duopoly inflicts on third party and independent candidates.  It provides critical education about the rigged electoral system the Republicrats have cunningly crafted.  This book shows that with courage and optimism one can stand up and fight with the corporate owned two-party system 
 This book has given me an introduction to the information needed to replace my septic field with regard to the length and depth of the field trenches and components needed. The book reviews the basics on perculation testing and various calculations for determining the trench dimensions as well as the amount and type of stone and dirt backfill needed. You then need to compare this data to your local code(Pa. Chapter 73 in my case). All States are a little different on their exact requirements for the work 
 A book that enables you to travel back in time...back to 1958, back to a time when there was Stan, Mike, Richie, Bev, Eddie, Ben and Big Bill and some others...back when some kids' main concern was avoiding Henry Bowers!  A story that, although long...over a thousand pages and in 'IT' years probably much longer, kept my attention throughout. Maybe you'll remember what it was like to cycle so fast that your feet lose contact with the pedals...the determination and camaraderie of building a clubhouse, the friendship and love that can overwhelm you when you least expect it to and the fear...fear of the unknown...and fear of the known.   A chilling yet absorbing novel that takes time to aquaint you with the characters and their experiences, so that you really care what happens to them - good AND bad!  
 When I read Oliver Twist, I literally could not put it down. I was getting in almost 90 pages per day!! It was so enticing, exciting, funny, suspensful, scary, whitty and downright fun. This is a testiment to Dickens' mastership, for it was his second book that he wrote. And personally, I think it is his best. Fagin, Oliver, Bill Sikes, The Artful Doger, Nancy, Mr. Bumble, Mr. Brownlow, Mrs. Maylie, all are wonderful characters that fit perfectly in this timeless masterpiece. Each of them have distinct personalities that are wonderful.  However, I deeply implore yo to READ THE UNABRIDGED VERSION!!! You will not understand most of the plot unless you read an abridged version.  Other than that, enjoy this wonderful masterpiece.  Oh and, Bravo Mr. Dickens, Bravo!! 
 Indeed that there are very few books like this one for which you feel that every minute you spend reading is well spent.   She writes in plain and simple English and every sentence has content, logic and weight. She also writes in a tight and balanced structure, so you can always unfailingly find each of her opinion illustrated and evidenced fully and succinctly. Therefore, even just by the writing style, it is an enjoyable book. Much more than that, it is an inspiring book for anyone interested in the impact of institutions, because it points out many interesting aspects about the government institution that worth attention and deliberation. Just to give an example, she notes in her book that many countries have something similar to Constitution or Bill of Rights that intends to uphold liberty and democracy, but many fail to enforce it nearly as well as United States, a country that enshrines "the right of its unelected Supreme Court to use the Bill of Rights to declare illegal the actions of the democratically elected legislature or executive". The book does not attempt to give a theory about how institutions influence development or how institutions itself evolve, but it shows that these are very interesting and potentially very important questions to answer.   For someone out of the legal profession, this book also provides the very necessary basic knowledge in balanced width and depth. (However, I can understand if a person well acquainted with law may find it too elementary.) 
 As soon as I bought the book I could not put it down I read it from top to bottom non-stop. This book is an easy read and very applicable. I highly recommend this book to gain greater insights in the Music business or any business. It was a great buy along with a couple of manuals I purchased from Musicbrains.net entitled the Indie label Kit 
 If you've more than skimmed a newspaper article on Wal-Mart, you probably have a general idea of what this book is going to say.  Wal-mart has made some management mistakes.  They've pressured suppliers into lower prices, often lowering the quality of merchandise (and lowering the quality of labor practices and/or impeding outsourcing).  They offer damn low prices for goods, so low that Wal-mart may have a measurable impact on keeping inflation lower. He doesn't add so much to the knowledge of the issue as make it very digestible as a quick read and give the Wal-mart story life.  He has a good mix of individual case studies and academic sources to display evidence of his arguments.  But in the end, this book is suffering from a few issues.  For one, this book is too long for the amount of ideas it contains.  It feels the author added a lot of needless fluff to add pages.  Second, near the end of the book, the author adds highly opinionated essays that are unnecessary, not particularly thought provoking (in my opinion), and detract from any objectivity this book may be providing.  He's at his strongest when he's telling stories, not editorializing.  This is a good book, but you may want to skim a few parts and skip the last chapter or two 
 There's a lot of detail packed into this small guide. I liked the winery reviews because they outline what kind of experience each winery offers along with the basics about their history and wines. And restaurant reviews were frank and on the money 
 One of the very reasons I enjoyed this 'novel' of sorts stems from the very style in which it is written.  I've reread it many times over since I bought it, and have found it as compelling the 50th time as the first.  The way in which Peck gives life to Martin and John, and the parents (lovers, stepparents, exlovers, etc) Bea and Henry in successive stories, changing histories, including other pasts, and including his own life in the story telling, gave me a way to describe a post-modern story to my friends; one in which a non-linear story line could advance a set of characters as well as be self-aware of itself.  This continues to be one of my favorite stories on my bookshelf, and I would lend it to anyone if I hadn't already loaned it to my friend 
 This book gives you practical, down to earth ideas that you can easily incorporate into your everyday life.  No time consuming charts to keep track of.  What I really liked was that many quotes and ideas were from successful girls and what they felt made them successful 
 Maya Angelou is a timeless treasure, and so is this book. It takes you on a journey that can help anyone rise above difficulties and sorrow. I highly recommend it for anyone who is searching for meaning in life, this book gives it! 
 Although I received these dishes in error (I had ordered the oval ones, but Emile Henry mislabeled the box), these little baking dishes are great!    The first thing I cooked in them was a vegetable au gratin dish and  they performed beautifully in the oven and went straight to the table because of their good looks.  They hold up very well in the dishwasher, even with repeated  cleanings. (To be on the safe side, I place them on the top shelf.)  They also make great plates for small meals (e.g., two eggs and bacon).  I am very pleased with these baking dishes 
 I've been "Access adverse" even though it would be good to know and use it for work. I found this particular book quite helpful and easy to follow due to a lot of graphics, a step by step approach and assumption that the user is starting with little or no previous knowledge 
 I read this book so frequently when I was a child that my copy literally fell apart.  I've now purchased a copy to read to my own son and am sure that he will enjoy the story of the determined fox family that consistently outwits the greedy farmers just as much as I did.  I always liked Roald Dahl's books because they were not the usual sunshine and teddy bear genre of most children's books.  Instead, the focus is on overcoming adversity with a bit of humor and a lot of sass 
 I got a little worried when I read the first pages of this book and found the author starting to sort through her daily garbage, making herself account for every piece of plastic wrap in there, every orange rind. I was afraid I might be meeting up with a humorless fanatic who put recycling ahead of all immediate human values.  But this book didn't turn out that way at all. Ms. Royte proved to be a lively, adventurous narrator who followed the different categories of her garbage to their destinations. She boldly went where no man has gone before - that is, no man or woman outside the disposal industry.  As she followed her paper discards, her plastics, her organic discard - she sometimes met with cooperative administrators. More often though, her requests for plant tours were stonewalled. It seems many people in the garbage business feel they have a lot to hide. But Ms. Royte usually persevered. She kept digging until she got at least a glimpse of the incinerators, compactors, or landfills where her garbage was hauled.  In the process, she introduces readers to some interesting, dedicated people. There are the professionals who have studied the engineering problems involved in waste disposal. But then there are also the rank and file workers. You realize who does the dangerous work of processing the garbage after it gets to transfer stations. There has been so much debate lately about the jobs taken by illegal immigrants. Most of this discussion centers around the restaurant industry. When people argue about whether average Americans would do this work, they are usually arguing about jobs such as bussing tables at Starbucks. However, in this book we see there are truly dismal jobs being filled by recent arrivals in the Country. We see people standing by conveyor belts, sorting mercury-laced shards from pure plastic at breakneck speeds - at speeds that exceed even what Lucille Ball had to cope with in the candy factory. Most Americans probably have never stopped to think how this work gets done - much less considered applying for such jobs. So "Garbage Land" is a real eye-opener on many fronts.  It shows how much work is being done under our noses, but is seldom realized or acknnowledged by most of us. This is a sometimes amusing, sometimes disturbing view of where all our conspicuous consumption ends up. It's an important book 
 The 80's spawned one high school teen movie after another, and John Hughes was the king of that genre.  But somehow along the way among the Breakfast Clubs and the Pretty in Pinks, Three O'Clock High got overlooked.  It's quite rare when I actually meet someone who's heard of this comedy gem.  I had quite a lot of trouble even finding a copy of it on DVD and was going to purchase a copy here on Amazon, but finally found it at a buy/sell/trade store in Hollywood.  So anyway, while I am very happy to finally have this movie on DVD in widescreen for the first time, instead of watching it on my VCR on a recorded scratchy tape, I was a little dissapointed that there were no features whatsoever on this disc (movie reccomendations don't count, you can get plenty of those on Amazon).  Further proof that not enough people know or care about this movie.  Furthermore, Casey Siemaszko, the star, the heart and soul of this movie, failed to develop as a lead actor since this movie never really got any recognition, (he had a lot of supporting roles in the late 80s such as Young Guns, Stand By Me and Back to the Future) which is a shame because he is too funny in this movie.  The movie has a good cast too, even though the protagonist of the film who looks 15 years too old to be in high school, he's the perfect school bully.  Not to mention this movie has the best school yard fight you'll ever see.  Please, check this one out.  John Hughes isn't the only one who could make good 80's highschool movies and this is certainly one of the best ones 
 This book  is just packed full of information of all kinds of needlework and is easy to read and understand. I have been looking for a book that would be helpful in showing  differents stitches in knitting and crocheting and found to my amazements that this book was just perfect. It not only showed crochet and knitting stitches, it had embroidery, needlepoints and more. I have ordered two more books since I first ordered my book and found it so informative. I purchased one for my friend "Maria" and one for my daughter "Ann".   
 This was my first Nora Roberts book and I was pleasantly surprised.  The book has many small stories about the lives of three (well actually four) women and how they affect each other all rolled up into one book.  She is a wonderful writer and allows you to really "see" the beauty in her books.  I am looking forward to the rest of the trilogy 
 If one wished to understand how life was in the 50s and 60s as well as to understand the mind of a genuine conservative, one only needs to read Right from the Beginning. Pat grew up as a Catholic in Washington DC, attending Catholic high schools and universities. Anyone who was an altar boy or who attended Catholic schools could identify with this story. It is a brilliant piece of writing by a brilliant man 
 Pamala Vorhees has managed to return from the grave to help her special boy wake up and do what he dose best.  Meanwhle there is a carnival that has come into possesion of Jason's body.  Add to that a wierd shock rock star and an obsessed FBI agent (do they come any other way) and this is actually the best book of the Black Flame series.  The characters are portreyed pretty accurately, in that there is no likable characters in the book; indeed the most sypathetic character is probably Jason.  Glo (a teenager possesed by Pam Vorhees) was a really well draw out person, until she was killd.  Alice was an interestng idea.  I loved that Stephen Hand made several connections to the Friday the 13th movies, like Jason's shack from Part 2.  And of course you add to that your token graphic violence and you have a book that should please most "Friday the 13th" fans, though not much of anyone else.  One tiny little problem was making Jason active only when he was moonlight hits Pam's decaitated head; that bit of magick seems a little silly, but it isn't as bad as the magical blade in "Jason Goes to Hell 
 LOTS! This album is a fantastic addition to my Breaking Benjamin collection. Ben Burnley retains his haunting vocals while exploring a more mature sound that makes this album _so_ good to listen to. I haven't listened to anthing else since I bought it. The Diary of Jane, Had Enough, Breath, Evil Angel and Dance With the Devil are easily my immediate favourites - which doesn't really count for much because I love them all! I love this band's unique sound, and I love how their sound evolves with every album.  Do not be afraid to buy this album unheard. I did and have not regretted it for a moment.  
 This is a really good album, but it could have been more.  Like how the hell is the best beat on the album the freakin' interlude.  Nonetheless, give this album a chance and you will enjoy it.  Some good songs are Inhale, Jerry Springer and No excuse for lovin.  Still, only RSE and Soul Position fans should bother 
 The focus in this book is on one of the most common implementations of Linux; as a complete Internet solution with a Linux server, Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP language.  This combination is commonly called a LAMP installation.  The authors lead the reader through how to pick an appropriate Linux distribution for your needs, install and configure the Apache web server, use MySQL to store data and use PHP to build Web applications.    The authors assume little or no knowledge of Linux and so include a basic introduction to Linux including common daily tasks and administration.  Once your Linux server is up and running they also cover how to use various utilities to administer it remotely.  Other chapters include information on server security, GNOME, file system, and permissions.  This is not a bad introduction to Linux and Apache but it does almost nothing with MySQL and PHP.  This is a basic text on how to get a LAMP server up and running.  It is not a text on how to program with PHP or how to create and administer a MySQL database.  For this information you will need to consult other texts.  However, since a LAMP server is one of the most common uses of Linux and there are specific techniques to get the Linux server, Apache, MySQL and PHP all installed and working together seamlessly this book is very valuable for this specific task.  Build Your Own Web Server Using Linux and Apache is recommended to anyone who wants to get a LAMP server up and running with a minimum of frustration 
 Dr. Chan's book is a comprehensive guide that will answer almost any question a patient or loved one could have about breast cancer. It is a fantastic, reliable resource that provides honest answers to tough questions 
 This books is a compilation of experiences and stories from Jewel's childhood up through adulthood, as well as experiences from the road.  I find her childhood and upbringing in Alaska fascinating so I had a hard time putting the book down.  She shares with the reader bits about her relationship with her family and friends, the glamour and gloom of being on tour, and how she became the artist she is today.  As you'll read from the book you'll see her talent was in her genes.  There are wonderful photographs from her childhood up through adulthood and her writing seems to come right from her heart.  I really enjoyed the book and insight into her life and recommend the book to fans who enjoy Jewel's music 
 Great reprint of this great classic science fiction / fantasy series.  Much appreciated.  Looking forward to purchasing the remainder of the series when they are published 
 In a world filled with headlines on war and hate, you and your family will enjoy these timeless classics that enthralls people of all ages (including men!). The beautiful poetic Anne captures our imagination and we can see a piece of ourselves in her with every step through her life journeys. Use these beautifully inspiring books to bring your family closer together and grab the attention of your children inspiring them to read other literature. This is a must read for anyone of any age! 
 This CD is brilliant!  The best CD I have heard for ages!  Side one new stuff all tracks excellent!  Side two old favourites - can't stop playing it 
 When I first heard Iambic 9 Poetry, it was a life changing experience.  For years you search for songs that make you feel, and in electronic music that isn't easy to find...  Danceable yes, maybe a few 4 to the floors will do, but they never seem to resonate in your heart the way a singer would.  Songs that make you want to express emotion instead of motion.  With this listen it pretty much salvaged my hopes for electronic music.  Forget about taking it to the next level, we can make any sounds we want now, this is the next dimension.  This is Tom Jenkins after he gave himself to his music and was held captive by ultra-unknown melodies and beats.      I dont want to go into every track because this album is just too beautiful to pick apart like that.  Some of the tracks are a bit raw and not very meticulous.  It's more like a foray to try and  break new ground I think.  I wouldnt want it any other way, this is how you feel your music, guitars, keyboards, drums, seamlessly blended at times, haphazardly thrown together forced to coexist with each other any other.  I think you will be either completely enthralled with this, or...your deaf 
 After hurricane Katrina has raged in this region the Sound of the Mississippi delta music became all the more precious. Of course "St. James Infirmary", the standard ballad for all New Orleans funerals, is represented. It talks about the pain of a man who has seen his wife a last time: "so sweet, so cool, so fair, stretched out on a long white table" in the hospital. What a music will arise now, after the dead bodies are "disposed of" with so few care. I still have a photo in my mind as a woman (near the flooded Canal Street) shoves her dead husband, whom she has bound on a door, through the water. Only the music with this Mississippi feeling, no further newspaper report, will soothe me in such moments. But if I hear the calming voice of Mississippi John Hurt again - or the infectious energy of Tina Turner - then, I think, it will go on again...  
 i can't say enough how much i've enjoyed this record. i've listened to it just about every day and i'm still loving it 
 I got these to dress up our daily Fiestaware as salad plates, and they go beautifully with the persimmon especially, but also brighten up the sunflower or periwinkle...  Stack up really nicely and compactly unlike the fistaware :-)  Enjoy! 
 Liz Bentley was born in a society that had limited opportunities for women. In the 1930's with the Great Depression this Vassar  graduate had only the socila outlet of the Communist party.  Kessler documents the importance that Bentley played as a Communist spy. Indeed before this book was written I always had the impression she was a courier or a bit player. Kessler documents that when bentley's lover got sick that she ran the spy ring. I always thoguth of Communist espionage in the 1950's as male driven from Greenglass, Julius Rosenberg, Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss. But this book docwement without Bently the FBI would not had the collaboratiog evidence for the secret Venona intercepts. Because these tapes were secret ,Bentley had no collaboration and only one person -William remington went to jail arising directly fromn her accusations. Bentley had to endure the hatred of the far left for being a rat , a liar and worse. She contributed to rise of McCarthy and for J Edgar Hoover getting more powerful. Benley was years ahead of herself -running a businees (admitedly a Communist front). She was sexually expressive and her lover -Jakob Golos (whom was married) was her boss in epsionage. Benley exposed  2 spy rings the Perlo and Silvermaster ring and in doing so performed a patriotic duty. Where I fault this book is that more details on the spy ring could have been given. Kessler seems to weant to defend Bentley against the far left but is uncomfortable delineating the extent of Soviet infiltration of the US Government. Such a thing sounds like McCarthyism (proof of the validity) and she may be showing her poltical bias in not making this connection. This book is a quick read and gives this fascinating part of US history. This book should be included in a Women's Study group 
 Every track is a surefire winner and guaranteed to enliven any festive ocassion. Contains most of his hits in a delicious variety of styles (rap,  ragga, samba, funk and the bubbly pop of Jingle Belele). The Boriqua Anthem  contains lively interactions between a DJ and callers to a radio station  and includes samples of C+C Music Factory. This is perfect party music and  a wonderful selection of different Latin American styles, delivered with  gusto and fabulous pop sensibility 
 Ok straightforward enough - I am a fan of 'Withnail and I' and ';The Peculiar Memoirs of Thomas Penman' - firstly I've seen a lot of films since first seeing 'Withnail and I' in the late 80's - I mean french films (Betty Blue,Les Amants du Pont Neuf) german films(Wingsof Desire) Serbian, Chinese, Northern European,English, American, a lot for one person - bucket loads - but after over 20 years 'Withnail and I' ids still my favourite film of all time andit;s had a lot of competition - sometimes everything comes together in a film, whether it's as raw as a spade sliced spud or a  styilisded piece of perfection which 'w& I' is both in spades nothing has come close for me. OK so that's 'W & I' out of the way.  I read 'The P eculiar Memoirs of ...' in Venice, Italy and then gave it to my girlfriend at the time, we split up a year later but we're still pals, so next time I must ask her whatr she thoyght of it, in any case I loved it - mademe feel less like a freak for my porn obssesscion and less guilty for feeling guilty in rthe first place and the healing and painful course that love outside of ones immmediate family will take throughout ones adolkescent and adult life.  I guess a lot of folks could associate with 'W & I; forgive the discguysting abbrteviation. but I'm pissed on two bottles of red wine (3.95 euros from aldi - still have one left : ) and perhaps many can associate wiyth Thomas Penman - they both seem male perspective orieantated - from their standpoint well Bruce Robinson is a man/male bollox, buyt where else should one come from bu6t their origins. Cheers to Bruce and to a beautiful portrayal of a decent love in Thomas Penman. To Innocence or the decency of the naive savage sarcasctic sosphisticate! Please publish this - maybe clean it up a bit. I have been a good amazonian custmner in the past! 
 If you only buy one new CD this year, this should be it.  There are very few artists out there that I can pop in a CD of & listen from start to finish.  Rodney has a way of getting your attention & involving you in every song he sings.  There is something about his music that anyone can relate to at some point in your life.  It is very refreshing to see someone that has a wonderful talent and a good head on his shoulders 
 This book is definately not a self help book.  I frankly found it humorus to read some of these other women's stories.  If you're looking for something to improve your relationship, this isn't the book.  If you looking for something kind of funny to laugh at all the silly things other people's MILDEW do, this is.  I think it would make a fantastic gift for a wedding shower or bachelorette party.  
 I have read this book twice and both times in 2 days tops! I wanted to climb right in and live amongst the characters. I felt so much love for everyone in the book that it was hard for me to finish it. This is a gem and I am so happy that her new book is out 
 ...make this a game worth snapping up. Spears injects life and behaviors into his paleo artwork, so kids imagine how the prehistoric beasts lived and died. The game is a little complicated, but in that respect it has more lasting value because the boredom factor doesn't slip into place too soon. And kids learn real science as they play. Fun game, great illustrative contributions by Spears 
 This book relates the authors experiences in the N.Y.P.D. from his days as a rookie at the Police Academy thru his early career as a gung ho idealistic officer and then his frustrations dealing with the mopes and low lifes in the toughest parts of Brooklyn. Did he at times step over the line? Well, if so, I'm glad he did. Unfortunately, with crime friendly juries often selected in N.Y.C. sometimes such conduct may be for the greater good of society 
 I received this pan today and I love it.  It made two fantastic sandwiches in less than 5 minutes.  The bread was crispy and had nice dark grill marks without being burnt.  The lid is heavy enough to compress the sandwich without any additional pressing.   If you have a large family this pan might be a little small.  I made two large sandwiches (approx 4 by 8 inches) with focaccia bread and had room for maybe one more sandwich.  This pan was very simple to clean as well.  Cheese that melted in the interior of the pan easily released after soaking in warm water for 5 minutes.  The exterior of the pan is enameled, as the description states.  However, the interior of the pan appears to be seasoned cast iron, not enamel as is reflected in the description.  This in no way detracts from the functionality of the pan.  I prefer the cast iron to the enamel. Properly seasoned cast iron is more non-stick than enamel.  I would highly recommend this pan to anyone that wants to make panini but doesn't want another appliance to sit on the counter 
 My daughter & I loved this book so much, we even know Tacky's cheer by heart: 1,2,3 left... A,B,C, right... flop down, roll over, Say, what's for  supper!  this is a beautiful way to show children that being different is  okay 
 I recommend this book completely.  It is funny, but it takes the subject matter seriously, giving practical advice much of which is useful for any couple, straight or gay.  The quizzes and style guides are fun, and the step-by-step wedding planning check list is enormously practical.  Lots of other guides were written in the 90s, but this book is new out this year, and it shows 
 Wow! this book takes me back! The Emersons are so much younger in this book. I almost forgot that I even read this. I loved Ramses when he was a child! I miss his long winded speeches.  I love how Amelia just goes looking for trouble. Some things never change. I hope we all can enjoy the Amelia series for years to come 
 The problem with this album is readily apparent if you read any other reviews here: This is not what Joe Satriani usually does. Usually his domain is of a consumate guitarist performing exquisitly arranged soft rock.  Here he is a consumate guitarist performing impressive pop-electronica.  Fans of Satriani, if they also like electronica, will find a refreshing take on a genre that he is obviously familiar with (if not a particularly refined performer of). They will also find plenty of his trademark guitar work: sometimes it is heavily disguised by distortion and synths (such as in the aggressive "Borg Sex"), and other times it is complemented by light strings and keyboards - as in "Until We Say Goodbye"  For fans of Electronica here there is much to recomend if they don't mind a slightly unsubtle piece of work - Satriani is clearly more familar with arranging the guitars than the composition of the backing tracks - they will find an album that, at its best, is a genre striding triumph. At it's worst it is merely retro dance-rock that might be found on an early 90's movie soundtrack (The Mortal Combat series comes to mind).   It isn't the best album Joe Satriani has done, but it is a decent album. It's not a particualry brilliant electronic album, but it is worth listening to. It's strength and its problem is that it never really makes up its mind what it is, and therefore never really settles, and so will not find rabid aprication from either rock or electronic fans.  Which is a shame, because the guitar work on here is occationally brilliant, and it certainly pushes at what is traditionally electronica, but from an unusual direction. Would I recomend it? Not to everyone, and it will certainly appeal to people who like guitar music more than electronica fans.  If it sounds interesting to you then that is probably your best guide - try it, you might like it. If you don't, then at least you'll have tried, and discovered an interesting layer to a impressive musician 
 The Buccaneers of America is a first-hand account of the life and exploits of real-life pirates in the seventeenth century Caribbean region. There are apparently rather few such eyewitness publications, and this one must surely rank highly among them. Alexander Exquemelin was a buccaneer himself, and relates those stories that he actually witnessed or those that he heard. His own participation is always left vague, and while he witnesses plenty he claims few actions for his own.  As a primary source, Buccaneers presents a lively narrative that any reader should be able to enjoy. Exquemelin first briefly discusses his voyage to the West Indies and then tells something about the islands in the region. While he does then continue with the stories of the pirates (a term he uses at the beginning of the text), he slips easily and effortlessly between tales of battle and daring, and descriptions of life among the other inhabitants of the region. This interplay makes the work come alive as we get a fuller picture of things. Thus, while telling the story of Henry Morgan's depredations on the Spanish towns, he stops to describe the catching and preparation of manatees, or turtles, so some other such thing.  What can the reader expect to learn about the Buccaneers? Quite a lot, though I found myself questioning some of it, and have to wonder how much Exquemelin embellished the stories for the sake of publication. The Buccaneers are invariably presented as warriors of almost superhuman endurance and martial skill, and also as the most sadistic and depraved of human creatures. Time and time again he presents descriptions of the tortures and murders that captive Spaniards were put through. A more extreme example of exaggeration comes when he writes about how four Indians ran two hundred feet into the trees carrying a one ton canoe with them, finally dropping it to make their escape. While such things may find favor with gullible readers of the late seventeenth century, today we can dismiss them as ridiculous.  I suspect that much of it is genuine, or at least close to genuine. It certainly takes no great leap of knowledge to find stories of man's inhumanity to man, and men can become good warriors when their lifestyle calls for it. Certainly while the Buccaneers themselves come across as far from sympathetic, this portrayal certainly makes their lives and exploits come alive 
 Melville's Moby Dick has always been one of my favourite books, and so I picked up 'Ahab's Wife'in the library out of curiousity.  Using similar language and style to Melville, Naslund has spun an adventure which is monumental is scope, incorporating the spiritual, moral and emotional struggles found in 'Moby Dick', but told from the woman's point of view.  Although Una is too good to be real, her story is never dull, and I couldn't put the book aside.  I loved the description of Kentucky cabin life, and the surpising relationship she makes with Susan the runnaway slave girl, and later the dwarf slave catcher who is chasing her. In a later episode Una runs away to sea, posing as a cabin boy.  The reader needs to accept the impossibile, of Una remaining undiscovered by everyone on board but her two friends, Giles and Kit. The harrowing canabalism which takes place in an open whale boat after a shipwreck were deftly written, leaving the survivors with unescapable guilt for their escape from death. The story wanders back and forth in time as narratives often do, and although there were times when I felt Naslund tried to include too much in the last third of the book, such as the encounters with Mary Fuller, Emerson, and even Henry James as a young boy, I finished the book with a feeling of happiness to have shared so much with the author 
 One of the most incredibly enlightening books I have ever read. A book about pleasure and love.   A book that everybody can relate to.  It fuses science and poetry and makes a unique contribution to our understanding of love and pleasure.  It is so beautifully written.    It transforns our understanding of the modern/historic civilization as they have liberated or limited our potential for intimate and pleasurable relationships. I will read this book over and over 
 ...and now I have got more than 20 albums by The Voice in my collection. I was into Rock and Jazz and never paid much attention to Sinatra, although I knew he was considered the best singer of the 20th century. When I heard this album I was absolutely shocked!!!. It is perfect!!! The voice, the songs, the arrangements, the sound... This album changed my life forever. After years ignoring Sinatra, I am such a big fan that my mother calls Him "your friend". Now I can only think about saving some money to buy more and more Sinatra albums!!!. Probably, if I had to select only 2 albums from my huge collection (more or less 1500 CDs and 500 vinyl LPs) this album would be the first, and the second would be some Bill Evans (the piano player, not the sax player).  I discovered Sinatra when a friend of mine, who is absolutely into Jazz, told me that Sinatra is his favourite singer of all times. And I thoug: "If me and Teo have more or less the same tastes in Jazz, I should try Sinatra". And this album was the perfect introduction to him.  So no doubts, if you are new to Sinatra, buy this album and you will so shocked that, like me, you won't stop buying more CDs by Him.  And I have to point something finally: I have read many of the reviews in amazon, recomending other albums or periods of 'ol blue eyes, but almost no one says nothing about his columbia years. I own the 4-CD box set "The best of the Columbia years (1943-1952)" and I think it is absolutely amazing. It contents mainly ballads, but Sinatra is in perfect voice, the arrangements by Axel Stordahl are fantastic, and the sound quality is quite good. Now I am listening to "The house I live in" and singing ...that's America to meeeee.   so BUY THIS ALBUM and you will changed forever!! 
 Okay, now I've officially forgiven Eric for Splitting Heirs. Eric Idle is a God. That's all I will say. The man is a genius. This novel was deep, insightful, funny, and above all, brutally honest. Eric has not has a perfect life, in fact he had a pretty awful life, and some pain shows through. But it's not a weepy pain, it's an ironic pain. And Eric doesn't want us to cry, he wants us to laugh (I think, who am I to interpret the Great Eric's meaning?) and this book delivers laughs. All I can say to you is that you must read it. I read it because I was a huge Monty Python fan; I love it because it's some of the best writing I've come across in years. No matter if you like Monty Python or Eric Idle, no matter if you like Science-Fiction, no matter if you even like reading, you must read this book 
 This is an easy to read book with leadership principles for people in all levels of leadership 
 This book never gets old.  It's timeless and always fun to read 
 Let me just start by saying that I just bought this book no more than an hour ago. As soon as I got home I picked it up and didn't put it down forr the next hour. As a huge "Dazed and Confused" fan, I was  extremely happy when I saw that there was a book to go along with the  movie. But the book is not just about the movie. It starts out with a great  introduction by the director and writer Richard Linklater. In this intro he  explains the time period, the pros and cons of the 70's, and where the idea  for the movie came from. Also in the book are synopsis's of all the basic  charactar (the best is Clints, the guy who beats up the nerd). This book  doesn't just follow along with the movie, it is an explanation of the  1970's, I enjoyed it considering I wasn't alive yet. So if you are a  hardcore fan of "Dazed and Confused" or a collector of 70's  memorobilia, than you need this book 
 A good history book of any sort should take a place in time normally only remembered in outline and fill in the colors, transporting the reader back into the heart of the story as if they were breathing it in.  Sowell's outstanding and chilling account of the Ray Chapman beaning not only does that, it could be held up as a model for how others can do the same.  That the subject matter of this book is a sporting event doesn't diminish its importance, but does the reverse, reminding us of the power our games can hold.  The Ray Chapman/Carl Mays saga plays against the backdrop of so many other major events in baseball that were it fiction one would be tempted to accuse the author of over-indulgence.  Babe Ruth's selling to the Yankees, the unveiling of the previous year's Black Sox Scandal, one of the closest pennant races in history; these are just some of what intertwined with baseball's single darkest moment.  And yet instead of randomly adding them in as dressing, Sowell masterfully integrates into his retelling of that day every surrounding element he can find.  Most strikingly portrayed is the stark personality differences between the pitcher and batter at the heart of the story.  You almost could not find in baseball history two players more on opposite ends of the likability spectrum.  Sowell details fully the love of ballplayers and Clevelanders for Chapman and the devastating shock his death caused, while simultaneously detailing the animosity that Mays seemed to live off, even before the fatal pitch.  It's noteworthy, for example, that from the details of conversations between he and Mays, even the oft-detested Ty Cobb comes off as more personable.  The emotion of the players, fans and family that Sowell is able to channel actually makes the book hard to read at times.  And that's what proves its success.  This is an extremely human tale about a very human endeavor.  Sowell deserves the highest praise for so perfectly treating it as such.  And any fan of the game, or maybe more so anyone who doesn't understand why baseball holds the sacred place to many that it does but wants to try, owes it to themselves to pick up this book and read this story.  "The Pitch That Killed" reminds us that even in those rare cases where baseball becomes black magic, it is still magic 
 I learned the basics of Groebner bases from this book and its the best introductory book on this topic. Authors have explained all concepts with the help of examples which makes it readable for people from other fields also. It also talks about applications of Groebner bases to other fields. The book gives lot of exercises which help in understanding the contents more. I recommend that if you wish to learn Algebraic Geometry and Groebner bases then this is the book to start with 
 I already own Buddy Scalera's Pose reference DVDs and was delighted to see he'd come out with a book. I am a professional storyboard artist and find the figure and light/shadow reference in this book to be extremely helpful. While it may be geared more to the comic book artist (fighting and swordplay poses); nevertheless, I think it is worth owning. It comes with a DVD with more material. For a modest price, I think it's a terrific source for anyone drawing the human figure 
 This book was a required reading during my first-year of high school in a course called Humanities 9 and I thought it was a pretty interesting, but very scary read. I must warn you: If you dislike violence, or are adverse to killing in any shape or form, then don't even think, I repeat, don't even THINK about considering this novel, as it is filled with intense violence and there are definitely some killings. Most of this violence is done by a character called Okonkwo, who in a desperate attempt to cover up any sign of weakness, will resort to extremely brutal measures, such as literally pounding with his fist or slaughtering with some huge weapon anyone unfortunate enough to anger him, especially his children. You see, this Okonkwo is a big fella (about 7' 3", weighing approximately 300 lbs) and he is also the championship wrestler of his village, so you KNOW a beating from this dude is gonna hurt. He is also a warlike fellow who treats cowardice like a disease, the only cure of which is an extremely severe beating as his children often experience. If you so much as cry or act in a timid or sensitive manner, then you can expect to feel the wrath of Okonkwo, that is, a severely intense beating that is akin to having a giant boulder fall right on top of you. It is some pretty intense stuff and Okonkwo is definitely Mr. No Play, and that is what makes this book so chilling, yet so compelling and captivating all at the same time 
 This is the best art history I have read. Spurling sponsors no theories, but reports the exhaustively researched facts with a real storyteller's grace. She brings the times and characters to life.More really is more, in her hands. Irresistible. 
 Alan Vega and Martin Rev were WAAAY ahead of their time. Though their debut wasn't officially released until '78 (and even then, it predated the debuts of Joy Division, Killing Joke, The Cure, and possibly even PiL by about a year or so), this guitarless NY duo had been around since '71.  Anyway this album is the genesis of post-punk/New Wave, performed with a beat-up organ/synthesizer Rev probably found in the back alley of a music shop, and a decrepit but chugging drum machine that brings a futuristic pulse to the eerie synths and Alan Vega's voice, which sounds like Elvis detained in Guantanomo. Very original, very creepy, and very cool.    The material varies from what would be otherwise poppy tracks made slightly unnerving due to their foreboding starkness (Girl, Cheree, Keep Your Dreams) to more haunting and atmospheric songs (Ghost Rider, Rocket USA, Che) and even one track that sounds a bit like a primitive Doors cut (I Remember).   Then there's the 10-minute Frankie Teardrop--perhaps one of the most terrifying and claustrophobic songs ever released, with Vega's banshee screams punctuating the narrative of a young factory worker who kills himself and his own family out of desperation and wakes up in hell. The conclusion, with its ominous synths and Vega sounding as if he's going insane from the horror around him, will leave a scar on your mind.   The bonus material includes a decent, if roughly recorded CBGB's performance and the confrontational and chaotic "23 Minutes Over Brussels" show which is important for historical reasons, I suppose, but isn't worth listening to more than once or twice. The first disc is all you need to know. A bit primitive and dated in places, but still vital, influential, and amazing for fans of the genre.      
 I bought the largely similar books on mechanical components by Sclater and Parmley. Both have drawings of similar quality, to the point of having identical drawings in a number of cases (presumably because both authors used the same third-party source for the particular topic). A very few drawings were disappointing, but most were very good indeed -- and even the disappointing drawings probably would be fine for most engineers (I am not one).  There are differences. The Parmley book presents more examples of certain devices (for example, more types of linkages). But that is not true for all devices, and I'm not sure it matters in the end since both books offer quite a variety of most. For me, not being an engineer but being a fairly quick study if I'm presented with something to study, the Sclater book was preferable because it included, in most cases, more detailed introductory essays about the variouse sections: gears, screws, linkages, solenoids, etc. In some cases, though rarely, Parmley's explanations were skimpy.  I'm trying here to draw some helpful distinctions, and hope I have, but I'll close by saying that I think both are great. If I had to choose, Sclater's would win, but if you can do without the more detailed explanations and would prefer marginally more devices presented, Parmley's may suit you better 
 Robert Ludlum is easily the best and most prolific dead writer in the world. I've heard that when he died he left behind a number of unfinished book ideas. I've heard that his estate then hired an as yet unidentified author to take these ideas and put them into book format. I've also heard that this author has used up all of Ludlum's unfinished ideas and now is using his own plot lines but carefully following the Ludlum formula of how a book should be written.   At any case, this is a post Ludlum novel published under his name (with a trademark symbol). How good it is depends on the reader, which is, I guess the story for any book. A lot of reviewers will say this book is absolute trash.   This book follows the Ludlum formula of a super agent in trouble with his agency. Enter a young lady with no secret agent experience or training but with expertise in some allied field that will be of great help to the agent. Add in a chase through exotic locations and you have a classic Ludlum story.   As for my own opinion, I think I like the new Ludlum's better than I did the originals, especially those published towards the end of his life. The new author seem to have new and refreshing ideas about how to take the familiar Ludlum situations and put them in a new light 
 good cd for the funklovers only, not as popular as skin tight, and fire but all op fans should have this plus funky worm was sampled to death, this features junie morrison way fo he went funkadelic, the tracks for those who cannot understand is a group in their prime trying lots of experimenting, and creativity along with it, unsung heroes of rock, and fusion,while the players played every style of music known to man in one song at that, and the songs are quality. this was one of few groups who could give funkadelic, a run for their money 
 If you are new to Zweig then this is for you. All the stories are very engaging and represent the style of writing of that era. I wish I could find more writers like Zweig, alas... Beware of Pity is also very good. He is probably my favorite writer next to Witkiewicz. Do yourself a favor and get this book 
 This is Ty-Dog from the east coast. Yo Free, pop ya collar on both sides man. You got another classic. Every track on this cd is tight. Suga Free pimps the (...) out of a track. Congratulations pimp 
 Dr Christine Palmer is on a simple pleasure getaway on her boat Windsom when he finds the sole survivor of a mysterious ship wreck. Unfortunately, the doctor's new companion, David Slaton, isn't exactly the average ship wreck victim. Although burned and battered, Slaton quickly takes over Windsom and directs the good doctor to take him to England immediately. Who is this guy and what is his problem?   The Perfect Assassin is a really memorable espionage thriller. I was drawn into the action from the very start all while trying to figure out who exactly David Slaton was, whether he was the good guy or the bad guy, and who exactly wanted him dead. I love the unexpected twist with the dead wife and child as the impetus for the main character's actions. I hope the author seriously considers turning this book into a movie. The effects and the action would be amazing on the big screen.  
 it was a hoot upon seeing this film in the theatre espeically the part where Candice Bergen tries to woo Burt back with her terrible singing "Better than Ever"  I think that is the name of the song ..as always Jill Clayburgh was winning as ever and Burt couldn't been better too.  Its a shame Jill's middle age romance flick with Jeffrey Tambor .. "Never Again" got the due it deserved when ti came out.  Everybody should check that out, its a hoot too 
 Gun's & Roses came out in the nick of time. Record companies were mass producing cookie cutter bands and they all sound the same. G&R made their debut on the music scene in 87 but didn't get big until almost late 88 early 89. Appitite is a true masterpiece. Welcome to the Jungle, It's So Easy, Mr. Brownstone, My Michelle....The list goes on and on. Put it in turn it up to 10 and Rock On! The they made a mistake. they realeased an albums worth of great songs on 2 albums. So instead of another masterpiece they wound up with 2 ok albums. Then they vanished. Anyone who is a fan of the music but couldn't care less about Axl should pick up Velvet Revolver with Slash and Scott Wieland from Stone Temple Pilots 
 Brilliantly adapted from a true story, poignantly filmed and outstandingly produced and acted, "Breaker Morant" stands alone at the big heap of great war movies. It's all here, of course: battle scenes, commando ambushes, honor, valor, betrayal, executions and a real 'kangaroo court martial'. The accused's fates are sealed from the opening salvo, as we bear witness to another example of the vast British empire taking no prisoners of its own, leaving innocent soldiers of the Commonwealth hung out to dry to protect its own repugnant brand of morality. The viewer senses this early on, but is compelled to watch every frame of this magnificent film. It will move you as few other films will, on almost every level of human compassion, duty and truth. In a film in which every line counts, the best line, quite possibly, is spoken by Lieutenant Morant, "These days its quite easy to be on the wrong side". A masterpiece 
 I found this book to be an excellent resource for those interested in Land Trusts and what they do. I am presently employed by one of the Land Trusts mentioned in this book and I think that Mr. Brewer is very fair and honest in his descriptions 
 Yojimbo is a vastly entertaining action film with all the elements of that genre: fast pace, surprising plot turns, and a justly famous samurai showdown.   But the central theme of the film is the difficulty of properly assessing trust and mistrust, and how the ability to do so is an essential feature of maturing from idealistic youth to seasoned adult.   The plot setup is straightforward: nine idealistic samurai youths band together to clean their clan of corruption. The chief administrator is unsympathetic and thus earns their distrust. The friendly chamberlain is keen to help, and they are enthusiastic in their praise of him. Full of trust, they agree to meet him at an abandoned house.   Unbeknownst to them, a wandering ronin (masterless samurai) played by the peerless Toshiro Mifune, has been sleeping in the back room, listening. They don't trust him at all, of course, even as he ascertains that the chamberlain is untrustworthy and plans to have them killed. Sure enough, dozens of armed men appear outside and only Mifune's quick thinking saves the young idealists from a sure death.   Despite his obvious skills in parsing out who is trustworthy and who is not in the shifting loyalties and politics of the clan, the young hotheads continue to distrust Mifune; this desire to make those calculations themselves leads again and again to near-disaster. Each time, Mifune's experience and moxie enables him to evade far superior forces.   At the film's conclusion, trust of another sort takes the stage. The evil samurai who was the corrupt chamberlain's right-hand man, played by the great Tatsuya Nakadai, feels that Mifune's manipulation of his trust was treachery of the blackest sort. Mifune explains that he had no choice but to mislead Nakadai (the details I will leave to the film). Nakadai says he cannot rest easy, and demands the satisfaction of a sword duel to the death.   This is rich moral territory. So misleading the idealistic in order to eliminate them is treachery, but then so is misleading the evil servants of corruption--if you are the evil servant. But from the point of view of our hero, the false trust/treachery was simply an unavoidable part of saving the young idealists from destruction.   By the film's end, the young idealists now appreciate Mifune's ability to sort out who deserves trust. This skill comes only with experience and maturity, and they have received a master class in trust from a rough-talking, uncouth ronin--one of the film's many sly ironies.  
 This field guide is a clear, concise, easy to read manual that contributes to the enjoyment of bird watching.  I found that the birds I see in my back yard and neighborhood were easy to find and identify correctly.  I would recommend this publication for use by any level of bird watcher from beginner to the most experienced.  The graphics and color are wonderful.  The color coded maps, showing summer and winter ranges for each species, are very helpful 
 Good info and a one-day read.  Very helpful for those with little knowledge on the subject matter

 This mini series rates at least a 4 star rating.  Very well done, fine performances by all.  I particularly admire Stacy Keach in this movie.  Fictional in nature, it should rank somewhere after North and South and Gone With The Wind.  Anyone who likes fiction from the Civil War Era will not want to miss this one.  (I cannot rate the new cut version.   I intend to keep viewing the original 
 I am currently half-way through Nan Lu's six-week program and I am pleasantly surprised at how good I feel.  Working in the finance industry in NYC can be very stressful, yet my head is clear, I feel calm and balanced, an my body feels much stronger. This program is helpful in addressing much more than weight issues. After only four days of practicing the Wu Ming Meridian therapy (Qigong), an ache I had in my shoulder for a few months disappeared.  To date, I've lost 5 lbs and 4.5 inches.  The exercises are the foundation of the program.  They are amazingingly effective for dealing with hunger.  In fact, I no longer get really hungry.  I like all of the foods on the recommended list and have been so much fun creating my own receipes for my vegtable stir-frys, that I haven't gotten to the recipes in the back of the book yet.  The book does gives you tips on how to get through each week, so you feel supported as you go along.  He also explains TCM in very simple terms so you can appreciate the process because you are learning why it works.  I've had success using TCM years ago for migraines so I didn't have to be sold on it's effectiveness.  I just wish I had started using it sooner to address weight management 
 This is a wonderful story and is told in such a way that it makes you feel like you're right there in the midst of it.  Beautifully and realistically written, and you don't want to put it down 
 This is a condensed version of the review I posted on my web site, The Purple Crayon. I'm the author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Publishing Children's Books, and I have to be familiar with books in the field. CWIM is a very reliable market guide.  Contents: Considering its title, it's no surprise that the bulk of CWIM is taken up by the Markets section. This provides information about publishers of books, magazines, greeting cards, and plays. There are several profiles of industry "insiders" scattered through. This year, the cover claims 750 individual listings in all, down from last year's 800, so the editors have been pruning. The book publishers section has about 200 entries. The entries vary in length, but always include addresses and other basics; they may also include names and titles of editors and art directors, a brief description of their publishing program, sample titles, and other information. Indexes help you find publishers by subject. New this year is a "Names Index," which lists editors--this is a very useful feature.   The first part of the book has articles, some of which present the same basic information for people just getting started every year, followed by 12 all-new articles and five "First Books" profiles. I always turn to this part of a new CWIM first. This year, articles that interested me included "Writing the Nonfiction Book Proposal," "The Newest Children's Book Imprints," "Mainstreaming the Graphic Novel," and "Blogging for Authors and Illustrators."   Comments: Though I like the feature articles, which cover topics of interest to published authors (reprints, self-promotion) as well as beginners, the reason to get CWIM every year is the Markets section. CWIM is almost always accurate, and saves anyone who needs information about children's publishers an enormous amount of time and effort. If you tried to compile this information yourself, you wouldn't have time to write or illustrate

 After a recent trip to Plymouth with the family (also heartily recommended), most of the tour guides & workers suggested this as a very good first read about the history of the Plymouth Colony. They were absolutely right (thanks guys). This is a very well written book that covers the main history of the Plymouth Colony from the establishment of the first successful colony through King Philip's War. Nathaniel Philbrick's main point is how the relationships with the natives changed from one of mutual dependence to outright open warfare between competing cultures. While telling the big story, he tells a lot of small stories along the way that make this a wonderful book. The details didn't interfere with the flow of the larger story. The writing is excellent. The history is fascinating. It's a must read for anyone interested in the Pilgrims, King Philip's War, early American History or Massachusetts history 
 I am a teenager and I read this book as part of an assignment in class. The book of Cinder Edna shows the plasticy-type "teenager," with a perfect, paper thin look, versus the homely, sensible girl with character. Cinderella marries the prince and has to sit through royal meetings and all of that, and Cinder Edna gets to marry the not-so-handsome prince and live happily. and have fun.  Any teen like me who ISNT one of the pretty or popular girls will get a boost of self-esteem when they read this book. I would reccomend this book to be in psychologist's offices and anorexic hospitals and the like ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.   I loved Cinder Edna. Your child will too 
 A big 'little' book by John Steinbeck concerning an unnamed army ( picture Nazis ), invading and conquering a small European town, and the lull in time that follows, as the invading army sits like a giant hen on the hopefully enlightened minds of newly formed citizenship. All grows impatient as the conquerer begins to doubt the superior word that they are winning the war, and the conquered, once willing overthrown people, sense insecurity and resort to terrorism. Steinbeck's work is mostly dialogue and reads like a taut play, and his eloquent passages speak clearly with no linguistic or cultural differences between the two groups of people, indeed they are all members of the human race, passing time like a bomb waiting to expire. Heavily indebted to Melville's "Billy Budd", ( one chapter seems an homage to Melville's tragedy ), I'm also reminded of a later work; William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick's "The Ugly American", in which an invading American army turns a corner of Vietnam into a bureaucratic nightmare. At 188 pages, ( hardbound ), "The Moon Is Down" reads very quickly, it possesses a timeless quality, being first published in 1942, just prior to American's entrance in World War II 
 I am 39 years old and have very sensitive skin, and because of that I had been using fragrance-free products by Clinique. I always thought I looked pretty young until I saw a picture of myself at 29. My skin was so much better looking! After doing some research I decided to give this a try based upon the favorable reviews, low cost and the fact that it's fragrance free. (Perfumed lotions make me sneeze).   After one use, I noticed a few things. My skin did tingle slightly for a couple of hours, but it wasn't painful; just mildly annoying. But there was no rash or irritation. My cheeks looked a bit red, however it appeared more like a natural tint. The second thing I noticed is that my skin almost immediately looked better! I know that sounds crazy. I also didn't need to put on any blush because of the tint I mentioned. As the day wore on, the tingling went away. (I also started using Neutrogena Light Night Cream for a moisturizer- it's fragrance-free, and doesn't have sunscreen which I don't need every day.)    I applied it the next morning again and noticed the same things. I decided  to try it every other day and have to say I REALLY notice a difference! My skin looks almost as good as my pic from ten years ago.   I think the minor discomfort I mentioned is due to my sensitivity to most products, but because I am so pleased with the results I'm sticking with it.  Update: After using this for a week I no longer have any sensitivity and my skin is incredibly soft and luminous! I would change this to five stars but I am unable to edit that portion 
 My wife and I threw an Italian themed dinner party and wanted some background music.  This cd was perfect.. .just exactly what we wanted.  It set the mood, was not too loud, and everyone loved it 
 I really enjoyed these essays, which range from theory to personal reflection. When discussing specific projects that she has been involved with, it's fascinating they way you are drawn in to feel like you're seeing the behind-the-scenes of the creation process.  The treatments of issues of theory were cogent, and well presented.  I confess that I dog-eared many a page.  The moments of personal reflection were at times almost too personal to bear...not what you might expect from a collection of essays, but welcome to this reader, nonetheless 
 An in-depth study of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt including an analysis of its historical record its construction details its symbolism and its relation to the Bible.  "As I set about the task of writing a new study of the Great Pyramid of Giza, I am reminded of the words of John Taylor, one of the earliest students of Pyramidology: 'Many must approve, before the thought will enter into the popular mind; and if that result ever takes place, I am only one among many who are entitled to a commendation; nay, there is no room for commendation to any one, for all do but impart what has been given.'   "I am only one in a long line of students who have expounded on the Great Pyramid. My original work on the subject, The Great Pyramid Decoded (first published in 1971) was only intended to be an introduction to the subject. It was to draw attention to other more comprehensive works. (Ex. The Great Pyramid - Its Divine Message by David Davidson and H. Aldersmith; Great Pyramid Passages by John and Morton Edgar; Pyramidology in four volumes, by Dr. Adam Rutherford).  "All these writers have passed away and their works are out of print [Artisan Publishers stocks Dr. Rutherford's four volumes, see our Pyramidology/Stonehenge section, ed.]. Modern day writers on the Great Pyramid have brought out some excellent books, but they all fail to present the most important feature of the Great Pyramid - God's plan for humanity architecturally embodied in its construction.  "It was the desire to fill this void that motivated me to produce a second book on the Great Pyramid, expanding my earlier work with additional details and illustrations, without weighing it down with complex and technical information available from past research. And, most important, to present the spiritual aspects and current theories concerning prophecy revealed in the design of the Pyramid, as an unbaised observer. I will let the reader choose what position he or she will take." - E. Raymond Capt  Mr. Capt, through his efforts, as explained above, has richly rewarded the reader with the contents of this valuable book. It is truly an in-depth study of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, including an analysis of its historical record, its construction details, its interior passages, its symbolism and its relationship to the Bible. Most interesting is the section dealing with the 20h century probes into its interior, and its remarkable coffin in the King's Chamber, not to mention the discovery that the Great Pyramid is the source for our modern weights and measures.   Nearly every page is accompanied by a drawing or photograph placed there to enable the reader to better understand the subject and thereby receive a greater blessing.   264 page 
 After the Joy Luck Club, this is probably my favorite of Amy Tan's novels. It was interesting and a page-turner. Tan's writing style has you looking at the novel from two points of view, Ruth and LuLing (mother and daughter), which gives the novel dimension. I highly recommend this novel, though it is sad in parts. 
 I would definitely recommend the book Olive's Ocean by Kevin Henkes. I found I was unable to put it down. I liked this book because it was not your typical book based on a teenage girl's summer. The main character, Martha wasn't al that interested in being popular or fitting in, her mind was set on other things. However, she was somewhat interested in boys. Martha didn't thrive being a fashion designer or work at a hair salon; she wanted to be a writer 
 For a dead man, Frank Zappa can still put out some astonishing music. This latest effort from the Zappa Family Trust is a collection of smoking guitar solos from the master of the guitar himself. Mostly recorded with his legendary 1988 touring band, Trance-Fusion sports some riveting dramatic guitar work supported by rock-solid fusion rhythm work by a big band that is nothing short of spectacular. People like to dismiss Frank Zappa as a weirdo who sings smutty songs with bizarre musical changes, but the reality is different. His guitar playing is out of this world, unlike anything else being put to CD these days, and the sound of these live recordings is lush, bountiful, and extraordinary. You can feel Terry Bozio's kick drum pulsate through your body, and hear every player's work sizzle upward through the potent brew of notes, and everything fits nicely into a jazz rock fusion framework that soars above all the current musical competition. I know this review sounds overly effusive. But if you enjoy guitar music supported by outlandishly expert musicians, then Trance-Fusion needs to be a part of your collection. NOW.  
 I love everything about this movie.  I watched it several times and never got tired of it.  Each time I watched this movie I saw something I had missed from the very first time watching it. The acting is wonderful, the music is great.  The plot is interesting, drew me right in.  It should have got an Oscar, and several best actor awards 
 I think bayesian theory will be used inevery fields of our life in the future 
 Judith seems to really hit her stride in this book.  "Bread Alone" (her first novel) was wonderful, "Isabel's Daughter"  was impossible to put down.  I found her characters and the storyline fascinating.  Fabulous book!  This book was also an excellent selection for our book club.  Can't wait for her next book "The Baker's Apprentice" due out anytime.  
 When I read Chapter 13 of this book where he describes the scene in Paris where 'Ferguson' is eating his breakfast and generally ripping them off as he pretends to guide them to the Louvre I had to put the book down because I was giggling and laughing so hard. Even now when I reread it for the 100th time it never gets old. Anyone who feels Twain was racist doesn't get how universally he applies his satire. 
 In Bath twenty-three years old Susanna Osbourne is contented with her life as a teacher at Miss Martin's School for Girls.  To her the school is home because ever since her father left her over a decade ago she has felt alone and fears to love somebody as those who matter leave you alone.  When Susanna meets handsome Viscount Peter Edgeworth, she immediately considers him an inconsequential flirt.  He on the other hands thinks she is a rustic boob who never left the classroom.  However he also finds her rejection fascinating and thinks there is a bit of a mystery behind the teacher that he plans to explore.  Surprisingly, though somewhat disparaging of one another, they become friends although both fears exploring the attraction that simmers in each of their minds.  The third Simply Regency romance (see SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE and SIMPLY DANGEROUS) is a delightful tale starring two interesting protagonists whom if first impressions mean anything should never have forged a loving relationship, but a game of cat and mouse gives them the needed time to do so.  On the surface Susanna and Peter appear like typical regency characters; however Mary Balogh makes their relationship an engrossing SIMPLY PERFECT (next book) read.  Harriet Klausner 
 I recently received my copy of HE5 and despite some shortcomings (i.e. strong material removed from HE4) this book is a great overall security reference. The wireless stuff was a much needed component and although the book targets the latest O/S releases it's got a lot of useful discovery/fingerprinting techniques, including searching the web for sensitive info.

 Micklethwait and Wooldridge have written a crucial work on globalization, drawing from a wide array of current and recent events.  It is hard to see the forest when you are in the midst of the trees, but these two lead the reader to reasonable perspectives about the current evolution of the world.  Years of editing and reporting, under the aegis of the highly reputable British magazine, the Economist, has rendered they two young writers nothing short of wise at an early age.  They write in general with more permanence than journalists do generally.  Their inherent alienation from US precepts, as foreigners, makes their perspective on that country more vivid than one might expect.  This book is essential equipment for the informed adult 
 I just love this book.When I was approched to be interviewed for it I jumped on the oppertunity.I believed in it then and I was blown away by how well written it is.Corvis has combined first hand experiance and knowledge with history and myth busting about the dark subcultures of today.He has scratched the surface of truely showing this world of ours how wonderful it really is to live in the darkness.I recommend this book to anyone who is within or is curious about the alternative side of the world!..A must have for any new age library or occult collection!! 
 Whenever anyone wants to talk about how to speak convincingly in a child's voice, I hold up one book.  Bastard out of Carolina is the ideal when it comes to dealing with the voice of a child and striking the right balance of a narrator who has experienced the events in the past but is not too much in the future that we cannot experience these things right along side her.  These things show us the skill of Allison's craft, but they do not on their own merit make the book what it is.  It is a compelling and disturbing story and Allison is thoughtful enough to not bring our narrator into adulthood and put the whole thing into perspective.  I can't help but think of how horribly the book would be damaged if we saw our young narrator later as an adult who was, probably through therapy, putting the past behind her.  The book remains youthful and therefore painful 
 These are definitely the best charts I've used to date.  I have the unlaminated deluxe copy spiralbound, and to have the objects color coded really helps a ton - makes it quick and easy to find stuff and even helps me orient the map faster.  However, I would caution using this in the field.  If you have problems with dew, definitely get either the laminated version, or buy it unlaminated and pay to have it laminated.  (You may have to compare at stores where you live to figure out if it would save you much to buy unlaminated and then take it somewhere - some have said the price isn't that different, others have said they saved a lot by doing the lamination theirselves.)  Another solution is to make copies of the area or constellation you want to observe, then if they get ruined or if you want to mark it to death, you can always make more copies.  You really need a good way to lay out the map in the field, like a table or something to make it easier to flip thru - definitely not for the grass and too big to just lay in a chair.  Marking the constellation patterns (i.e. connect the dots) also helps, and it's convienent to do on laminated copies as you can use a dry erase or grease marker, and if you make a mistake you can fix it or even mark places for observing sessions, as they easily wipe off.  Overall..  I would most certainly recommend the deluxe spiral version (the one w/ color identification).  A Great Buy!!! Pros: color, nice big charts that show a good expanse of sky, not too detailed but more so than average charts in a book, not exceptionally heavy and easy to pack Cons: susceptible to dew, can be awkward to flip thru w/o a table or similar prop, unlaminate 
 The dvd concert offerings from this 1970's super group are limited to just three releases to date.I don't really consider the second dvd release (Journey 2001) without Steve Perry,because in my opinion it's not the original Journey.Considering the age of this show,you get an amazing 1981 concert dvd from their Escape Tour with impressive picture and excellent dolby digital 5.1 sound.Overall it's a great show and any Journey fan would be happy to have it in their collection.DVD track list from Journey: Live in Houston 1981 - Escape Tour is listed below:  1. Program Start  2. Escape  3. Line of Fire  4. Lights  5. Stay Awhile  6. Open Arms  7. Mother, Father  8. Jonathan Cain Solo 9. Who's Cryin' Now  10. Where Were You  11. Steve Smith Solo  12.

 Tom Perrotta is a gifted writer.  "Joe College" is a pretty good book that centers on a working class youth from New Jersey who attends Yale.  The book focuses primarily on the class struggle of the protagonist Danny, who doesn't quite fit in with the trust fund kids of Yale or his ambitionless, working class friends from his hometown.  The book does a good job of highlighting college life from Spring Break to work study jobs to dangling multiple romantic interests at one time.  Perrotta's greatest gift is that he can insert a minor character, a line or dialogue, or an image that will remind you of what it was like growing up.  The book has a few flaws--for instance, the Danny character doesn't overcome his obstacles, instead, they solve themselves leaving him off the hook.  Also, while it is easy to identify with Danny, he does have a few traits that make him somewhat unlikeable.  This may also leave you thinking at the end of the story, "what was the point?"  However, it is still a very good book.  Looking at Perrotta's other works, "Bad Haircut" is still his best book.  "Election," which isn't as good as the Alexander Payne movie, is funny, structurally brilliant, and a quick read at around 200 pages.  "Little Children" is decent but not as good as critics have said.  "The Wishbones" is entertaining, but it is, by far, the weakest of his books 
 I found the articles light and easy to read, yet interesting enough to keep me up in bed.  Also, very informative.  Good selection of case studies on topic.  As good as HBR Effective Communicatio 
 A beautifully written work, the usual evocative and sad voice of Margaret Atwood as she inhabits female characters so deeply and convincingly.  The time and place are described flawlessly, you feel you are right there with the characters, and you wish you could swoop in to the story to give them guidance---but you can't. All is inevitable.  Haunting and memorable.  Read it!! 
 I like this book. I don't love it. It has interesting mini-stories about people who lost weight and kept it off, just like the title states, but doesn't go into great detail 
 As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release and a teacher with over twenty years of experience in an impoverished high school, I found Evan Hunter's THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE fascinating.  Ed McBain, the celebrated mystery writer, was a teacher back when he wrote this book.  Evan Hunter is, as we all know, Ed McBain's actual name.  I suspect he based his Richard Dadier character on his own experiences.  Dadier is an idealistic young man with his first professional job as an English teacher in a working class high school.  Dadier does his best to reach his students, yet the challenges are great.  This book is a classic, and it still applies to teaching these days.  I truly wish Evan Hunter would return to THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE.  America needs its best and its brightest in our classrooms.  As I can attest to from my experience, one can teach students and write mysteries without sacrificing either career 
 This is must reading for thriller "addincts." Mr. Child at this best. 
 The Wizard of Oz was very good. There were magical creatures in the Wizard of Oz like the Scarecrow & the Tin Woodman. Toto was cute & said,"woof! woof! woof! The Lion could talk like a human. I realy liked the Wizard of Oz. -by B.C 
 The CD combines 2 great LPs for Tony Williams. "Believe it" and "Million Dollar legs".  Key musician with Williams is Guitarist Allan Holdsworth, whose style falls between Rock and Jazz and sometimes using his guitar as a keyboard; vocals, background brass and strings are also added in some of the songs. Although I would not call this CD as the perfect one, it is very much worth exploring by all fusion collectors and anyone interested in Holdsworth and Williams work; not to mention that this CD has a good value since it is 2 LPs combined. Personally this CD is among my preferred ones in my fusion collection. If you like this CD, then I can recommend: Brian Auger in the title called "Second Wind". 
 I just got my set, I was a kid when this show was running. I loved it then like I love it now. The show is delightfully witty, and the themes of the show are as relevant now as they were then. I have read a few of the other reviews and I have to agree. My heart did sink a little when I read that the music was changed. It's a shame that probable fighting about song rights equated to cut scenes and a weakening of the originals. 
 Having read the other reviews on this book and the options on this website to "look inside this book",and I did end up buying this book.A wise decision.  This book is interesting.Plenty of information throughout.Most guys will find this book helpful in the dating game.Its a good size book that doesnt drag on.The author makes her point clearly without the usual psychologist babble.She doesnt sound like a psychologist either.The author is like having a good female friend giving you advice on picking up women.  Overall,a good book.Its worth considering and adding to your other "picking up women" type books.I would suggest you buy a book on body language as well.   The book is a little overpriced by a few dollars compared to similar type books that are available for around $10-$15.(Sorry,Katalin. 
     Or Give Me Death: A Novel of Patrick Henry's Family is one of the BEST books that I have ever read.          The first half of the novel starts out through the eyes of Patsy (whose real name is Martha) the oldest of Patrick Henry's children. She tells about the struggles in which her family faces while her father is away. Of all of the hardships, the most difficult one to deal with is her mother's behavior. After Sarah (Patrick's wife) almost drowns baby Edward on purpose, the family is forced to choose what to do with her, and how to break the news to Patrick Henry that is wife is going insane. These descions begin to slowly break the family apart. As they keep secrets, take sides, and dislike one another. At the end of the chapter, Mrs. Henry tells one of the children who is going to inherit the "bad blood" (her illness).      The next half of the book is told through the eyes of Anne, the second daughter of the Henry family. Anne, a bit of a tomboy, longs to take part in activities that Patsy would call "unladylike". This and a few other issues cuase a fued between the sisters. With a war on the rise and Patrick Henry not at home  the house is quiet and full of secrets and lies. Anne becomes plagued with the constant question to herself:  "When do you tell the truth and when do you lie? Do you lie to protect someone? Is it wrong to keep a seceret, when, if you tell, someone gets hurt?"  This superb book has history, romance, lies, secerets, mystery, and something for everyone. A must read for anyone over thirteen looking for a good book! Enjoy!  **Make sure that when you read the book that you take notes of suspicious things. It will help you solve the mystery better. Also READ the author's note at the end of the book when you are finished. It explains soooooo much!* 
 This book is more than just a women's history book.  So many issues and themes run tangential to Martha Ballard's diary that it can satisfy many different history buffs:  sexual mores, the transition of our nation from a colony to a country, domestic violence, everyday domestic chores and the difficulty of finding 'good help', infant mortality, town hierarchy and patriarchy, etc.  I really have to hand it to Prof. Ulrich, she had to dig deep and cross-reference other peoples' diaries and court records to catch the gist of Martha's euphemisms--especially when recounting the North-Foster rape trial or even noting when Martha was miffed with someone for a poor payment.  Then, there's the sticky fact that Martha's family was closely associated with Tories.  Again, Martha alludes to these issues indirectly but Prof. Ulrich really digs them out.  My only minor complaint is that the book was not written in a completely chronological fashion.  Nonetheless, it's engagingly written 
 Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poetry, especially the "Sonnets from the Portuguese," is beautiful, intelligent, and honest love poetry. Anyone who has experienced the doubts, fears, and transformation of love will recognize the truth of the poet's struggle to trust and to love 
 In the era of self-help, many have tried to write of love romance, & sex.  None succeed to the extent that Person has in this fine text.  By identifying romance as an  act of imagination, a quintessentially psychological act,  Person delivers the insights that can enable the cognitively  oriented lover to achieve transcendence while keeping  one's feet on solid ground 
 This book was about two boys named Jimmy and Seth. They met one summer at the park by where the lived. They both dreamed big of making it to the major leagues. Seth wasn't as good a player as jimmy but his game improved. They would both practice with each other at the park near where they lived. Their chemistry on the diamond made them the perfect double play combination. Although Seth and Jimmy were perfect together.on the field they were very different. At first Jimmy was the most mature one but as they got older jimmy started drinking and Seth tried to be the voice of reason. At the end of the book Seth was just like Jimmy was. I think that this is a great book that symbolizes the importance of friendship and how everyday decisions can shape I think that this is a great book that symbolizes the importance of friendship and how everyday decisions can shape your character.  
 Elie Wiesel is a master storyteller.  He has taken his extraordinary experiences and used them time and again to narrate novels that cause readers to question along with him.  "Dawn" is a novel in that same vein; Wiesel likes to ponder questions that may never be answered.  "Dawn" tells the story of Elisha, a survivor of the concentration camps, who finds himself drawn to Palestine and to terrorist activity in the name of saving the Jewish people.  After everything that has happened to his people throughout history and after WWII, fighting is the only option for these passive people.  Elisha has been chosen to serve as executioner to a British officer, kidnapped as retribution for the kidnapping and planned execution of a Jewish rebel.  Elisha struggles with what lies ahead of him at dawn - he believes he could kill the British man if he hates him, but he cannot find any hate within himself.  In fact, Elisha struggles with the whole purpose of his mission, and the cause for which he is fighting.  He cannot imagine himself labeled as a murderer, and is fearful of making those who formed him into murderers as well.  He is utterly torn as to what he must do.  Wiesel tells the story through flashbacks, allowing us to see Elisha's previous experiences before coming to Palestine.  We learn that he was lucky to survivie the concentration camps, and that luck may have played a hand in the lives of almost all is friends in the terrorist network.  Wiesel, as always, ponders serious questions concerning ethics, religion and morality.  He makes a poignant case for the Jewish nation, but recognizes that answers may be a long time coming 
 This book was so adventurous and smart I couldn't put it down. It has 512 pages and I read them all in 2 days!  Robert Doniger and his crew have discovered a wormhole and created a machine that can send people back in time to 1357 France. He begins sending people through the wormhole, but as all scientific discoveries, it has its flaws. The time travel begins to take its toll on everyone who goes through it. Some people are killed or left behind in 1357 France due to the war going on during that time, while some have simply gone through the wormhole too many times and slowly their insides become disfigured. The book goes into detail on how and why this problem occurs. In an attempt to prevent future deaths and to find those left behind, Donigen hires Professor Johnsten, an archeologist studying the remains of Castleguard, France, to provide him with more information on 1357 France so he can better prepare his time travelers. Of course, being an archeologist, Professor Johnsten wants to go see this time period for himself. Professor Johnsten becomes trapped in 1357 and his team begins to wonder about him being missing for so long. The book also goes into detail on how and why each person can only stay in 1357 for a certain amount of time. Professor Johnston's assiatant, Andre Marek, and a few of his students, Chris Hughes, Kate Erickson, along with a few people of Doniger's crew are asked to go back in time and find the professor in order to avoid the press getting involved and any lawsuites. Once in 1357 France, things begin to go wrong the moment they get there. Doniger's crew are killed and Chris gets separated from Marek and Kate. This begins their adventure full of battles and danger where they meet many interesting and some evil people, such as Lord Oliver, Sir Guy, Lady Claire, and Robert de Kere.  This book is the most exciting thing I have ever read. I wish I could put more details about the book into this review but there is so much going on and so much to tell that it couldn't be told in less than... well 512 pages. This book also explains why and how everything happens. It gets a little wordy and complicated in the beginning, but it is crucial to the rest of the story. Michael Crichton does an excellent job of making sure the reader has no questions about how things happen. It is absoultely brilliant 
 I absouletly LOVE this doll. Her eyes are green and her golden blond hair is beautful. And the way her hair,lips, and eyes go together is GORGOUS! And i espally love her puffy-sleeved top. Is there a way to put 100 stars on here?? 
 I've read this book twice, about a year apart. Each time I benefit. Swami Rama writes about his spiritual development, gained from not only his master, but from other adepts he visits. What he learns from each,  he summarizes to the reader. What I gained from this book is ANYTHING is possible: returning from death, healing, precognition, teletransporting, you name it, it's here. Although God is given credit for everything, it's the mind that is God-realized that is necessary. I am reminded of the Autobiography of a Yogi, but I related to this book more easily. Maybe I have advanced a bit .. 
 Never before have I seen an origami book that brings in so much art, design, and mathematics. Not only does Engel make incredible and very challenging origami, but his sense of design makes it a delight to see come about. His first 81 pages are introduction and theoretical discussion of origami and the design concepts behind the artform. While he may be a bit esoteric at times, his discussion is quite interesting as he delves into fields ranging from music to geometry to architecture. The models show wonderful 3-D realism for the most part and will pose a challenge to all but very advanced folders (and if you still need a challenge use smaller paper). I especially enjoyed the octopus, squid and knight on horseback 
 This is one of my favourite musicals (along with Seven Brides for SEven brothers). A great good natured movie which followed a hugely successful Broadway show of the same name.  Cole Porter's amusing songs set on the background of a stage musical based around Shakespeare's taming of the shrew. In the background are the ex husband and wife (Fred and Lilli - played by Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel) who are reliving their own version of Katherine and Petruchio as they figure out their own failed marriage  This is not a difficult film to watch emotionally, as you can imagine Cole Porter is not Oprah Wingrey. However it is enormoulsy good natured, I love Porter's clever lyrics and Howard Keel and Grayson are extremely good in their roles, A neat supporting cast.   There are a few stretches in some of the songs - I mean how on earth could they really imagine that 'Wunderbar' would be a great song for a shakespearian play set in Italy? Still it fits in and it is fun to watch just how they manage it - and as for teh two gangsters singing, 'Brush up your Shakespeare' rhyming Heinous with Coriolanus!  There are really no extras on this at all - if you hoped for an interview or deleted scenes then forget it, it is the movie, and a few picture scenes with a bit of information on them, nothing that you would want to buy this DVD especially for.   One of the best musicals, lots of fun and a good watch 
 Jerome graduates from high school and enrolls in Strathmore Art School. Picasso is his hero, and he intends to become "the greatest artist of the twenty-first century." Lucky for him, Bardo, who has flunked out and started over three times, takes him under his wing and disabuses him of his innocence. He's pegged every pretension of every classmate, and thus the side-splitting parodies begin. Here is the beautiful beatnik, he tells Jerome, over there is the vegan holy man, then the angry lesbian, the boring blowhard, the brown noser, the fifty-ish mom trying to find herself. "Oh wow!" exclaims Bardo, "another ironic pop culture reference!" The professors with their inflated egos and deep insecurities are even funnier, as are the classroom dramas when students critique each other's work and pontificate about "good art." Unfortunately, into this satire the directors insert a real plot when Jerome falls in love with the nude model Audrey, is upstaged by the hulk Jonah who is at Strathmore for reasons other than art, and then concocts a plan to win her back. He concludes, "I'm a living cliche just like the others. 
 I own Darrell Bock's 2-volume work on Luke with the Baker Exegetical Series.  I found this commentary to be even more helpful.  Bock displays an in-depth understanding of the Gospel of Luke.  Not only does he present a sound exposition of the message of Luke, but he gives the reader excellent application for today.  I own many of the volumes in the NIV Application Commentary.  This one is one of the best in the series.  You won't be disappointed with this commentary on Luke. 
 I had no knowledge or affinity towards NASCAR racing before reading this book.  The author makes the subject interesting to those of us who don't know the drivers, the car racing teams, the tracks or anything else about NASCAR.  It is a funny and at times hilarious read of one man's love with racing and the Winston Cup.  While not at all "high browed", one begins to understand the sociological context of this fast growing sport.  I recommend this book the fan, nonfan and the curious 
 The characters and their dry humor are better than the story, which is pretty good.  The narrator Will Patton really makes the characters come to life.  Historical details are nicely woven into the story.  If you buy the book and miss the narration on the CDs, you will miss a lot.  I gave it 5 stars because when I listened in the car I always wanted to keep listening after I arrived at my destination.  And I want to find more books on CDs by this author and narrator.  I even liked the incidental guitar pieces at the end of each CD.  In fact, I listened to it two times, back to back.  Reviewers, please consider that people who have not yet read the book might read your review, so please save them a surprise or two 
 This is a story about someone who is passionate about building a team and building character.  It is inspiring to read about Anson Dorrance's own search for excellence in his field and in the lives of the young women who play for him.  Bravo to all those involved in producing this excellent book 
 I say story because it's short.  Which is probably what makes it the most accessible as well.  A great futuristic story by Ayn Rand that encapsulates her philosophy of objectivism in a little bite sized morsel.  Not to mention you don't have to suffer through an 80 page recap that restates what you had just been reading for the last 800 pages (i'm looking at you Atlas Shrugged) 
 So far this is turning out to be one of my favorite books of 2007, mostly because the writer's voice comes across so strongly. The short pieces are something like meditations on various aspects of butch life, masculinity, femmes, chivalry even.  Butch is a Noun has a thoughtful quality that is simultaneously political which I think is an ideal combination for a book about living in the world as a misunderstood gender 
 A periodically terrifying, very accessible story of the rise of SARS, its probable origins in the wildlife markets of Southern China, its march through Asia and then around the world, and the Chinese government's attempts to censor and hide the true severity of the disease. I have both personal and professional interests in the ecological impacts of the wildlife trade, and it was edifying to hear Greenfeld's account of how the rise of China's economy in the 1990s led to an "era of wild flavor," in which exotic animals from around the world were thrown together in horrifying wildlife markets, slaughterhouses, and "wild flavor" restaurants. This proves to be an unbeatable environment in which viruses can mutate from one animal host to another, through the relentless pace of viral evolution, and eventually make the zoönautic leap to infect humans.  Greenfeld, who was a journalist and editor for TIME Asia in Hong Kong at the time, makes heroes out of the epidemiologists and virologists who raced to understand the SARS virus and the brave doctors and nurses who treated patients, risking their own lives, while the Chinese government mercilessly censored the story. He intersperses his own story, as he and his family and the journalists he worked with were fearful of their own safety while trying to understand and cover the story. As Greenfeld observes, SARS has by no means been beaten -- it's not clear why the disease roared through China and Southeast Asia in 2003-2004 and has receded since then, since it's still basically uncurable by the medical technologies there. So there is abundant reason to fear another outbreak.  There are some periodic laugh-out-loud moments in the story, surprisingly. For various reasons of political correctness and increased delicacy in the international medical community, for example, it's no longer considered kosher to name a disease after its place of origin. Thus, we'll have no more new diseases like "Spanish flu" or "Ebola virus." But through sheer carelessness or inattention to detail, the coalition of scientists and medical people who named the disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome inadvertently gave it the common nickname SARS - as if they were naming it after the Special Administrative Region (SAR) that the Chinese government now calls Hong Kong and the New Territories, where the disease was first detected. Huh 
 There are fifteen excellent stories here, most of them very inventive and several with really ingenious plots.  There may be one or two infelicities of language but I think the author captures the Arthur Conan Doyle style very well.  Even the great man was responsible for using "disillusionize" in one of the canon stories!  I bought the book because "Sherlock" magazine recommended it saying it was one of the best collections of Holmes pastiches for some time.  I heartily agree. 
 Great Book. This is the first book of its kind that tells us not what to eat or how much to eat like others really know our bodies more than we do, but tells us HOW to eat. And that is the key to weight managment.  A must for everyone whether they are trying to loose wt or not 
 Grant Hardy's collection of poems, some of which he translated from the Chinese, gave me comfort and perspective at a crucial time in my life; I read them in a hospital awaiting exploratory cardiac surgery.  I had read  many of the poets before, but only one of the poems, so there was a freshness to the experience.  Mr. Hardy's biographical insights are printed on the same page as the poems, providing interesting connections between poet and poem.   The experience led me to look back and forward on my life and prepared me for whatever the future held 
 "My Life as a Dog" is a most unusual and most enjoyable movie.  It is a Swedish film which I watched with the aid of subtitles.  It would seem to qualify as a "coming of age" movie because it is about a 12 year old boy and his learning about sex and human fraility.  Yet there is so much more to the story that it seems wrong to limit its' definition.    I missed the first couple of minutes of the movie but I doubt that there was some grandiose explanation as to what was about to transpire.  What I saw was the story of a 12 year old boy (Ingemar) whose mother is ill enough that it affects their relationship.  (His father is not a part of his life).  At times she is his best friend and at times she is his worst enemy (with his brother a close second).  Maybe that strikes us somewhat of our own relationships with our parents at that age.  However, this relationship seems well beyond the ordinary.  Ingemar has a child's normal curiosity and he seems to always being doing the wrong thing; usually as a result of something his brother did.  This strains his mother's frail health.  At one point, the mother needs so much peace and quiet that Ingemar is sent to live with his uncle up north.  There the movie takes a turn for the better from our perspective.  His uncle is a happy-go-lucky fellow who takes Ingemar under his wing.  Ingemar makes many friends and seems to be having such a good time that we think it's too bad that he has to return home to mama after a few months.  However, the director lets us know that home is where Ingemar's heart is.  His heart is also with his dog who was sent to the kennel when Ingemar left for the summer.  Well, enough of the plot.    The many scenes throughout the movie are well written directed and acted.  Sometimes the movie seems more of a sequence of scenes rather than a movie with a theme.  However, the theme is there and it was the title of the movie that helped me see it.  Ingemar has a number of scenes where he shares his youthful thoughts and observations.  He is fascinated by Laitka, the Russian dog who went up in space (this movie takes place around the late 1950's).  He understood Laitka to have died because the Russians did not send along enough food or make any arrangements for his return; they just used him for their purposes and then were done with him.  I understood this to be Ingemar's life to that point.  He was brought into the world without any proper provisions for sufficient love and nurturing.  His future is unplanned as he is sent to wherever he'll fit in without any real concern as to what best for him.  Ultimately, there is no place for him to return to.  This is an excellent movie that combines a great script, excellent directing, and very good acting.  The cast is all new to me and they were well-assembled.  There are a lot of unusual characters that give the movie a special sort of seaoning.  "My Life as a Dog" is not a depressing movie.  Rather, there is hope as the movie leaves us knowing that Ingemar has lost his two best friends in the world but has just discovered that he is starting to find some replacements.        
 This is the last major novel of Edith Wharton (1862-1937). She was a New York writer who moved to France in 1910; and, she wrote six well-known novels starting with "The House of mirth" in 1905.  The present novel won a Pulitzer Prize in 1920. I bought and read the Penguin Classics Red version. My version had the text only and there was no analysis of Wharton or the novel. The edition posted here for sale has additional comments. The red version is slightly cheaper and from what I can determine is the same novel. The near 363 pages are a fairly quick read and I read it in two evenings. The prose is straightforward and there are not too many characters. It is a well-constructed novel, i.e.: it is medium length, it has a good plot with interesting characters, and it has some mystery.  The setting for the novel is a bit reminiscent of Henry James or F. Scott Fitzgerald. Wharton's characters are a bit more level headed and easy going and do not seem to go through violent swings of emotion as one sees with Fitzgerald.  Without giving away the plot, the story is set in post WWI New York, among the wealthy social families. It is a love triangle among three wealthy people: two women and one young man, the protagonist Newland Archer, a young New York lawyer. She describes their balls and dinners and nights out to the opera. We follow them to Boston and out into the country on vacations and weekends off. There are no "common folk" here among the characters. They are all in a few related families.  The novel is very well written. It is clear, concise, and it is an interesting and a compelling read. She generates enough interest to keep our attention throughout. Once you start to read, one will look forward to getting back to the novel during breaks. The main three figures are sympathetic characters and mostly an interesting story.  Wharton has an easy going and clear style that is easy to read. Most will enjoy this novel.  I recommend the read: 5 stars. 
 Everyone I've ever played this CD for runs out and buys it the next day. If you love jazz, funk R&B or any other kind of music for that matter this needs to be in your collection 
 Admittingly, when I first heard of Aly and AJ, I just thought "Oh great, more "Disney Channel Stars", aka actors from the TV shows that turn singers, who are really just fakers, who get Disney more money. When I heard their remake of "Do You Beleive In Magic?",I simply rolled my eyes, thinking how low could Disney get? But when I heard their first single, "Rush", I actually thought they sounded pretty good. Then I heard their other song, "No One", and by then, I was completely confinced that I had to buy their CD when it came out. I wasn't dissapointed.   -Rush: A little old by now, but still has that good beat and the music and lyrics astound me, 9/10 -No One: A nice, soft, inpirational song that I could relate to, 10/10 -Collapsed: A bit of shouting in this one where I can't understand the lyrics, but still great 9/10 -Something More: A nice blend, 8/10 -On The Ride: Quite frankly, a letdown after "Rush" and "No One". It didn't seem fast enough for me, 6/10 -Speak For Myself: Good enough, 7/10 -Out Of The Blue: Very nice and slow, just beautiful, 10/10 -In A Second: The only one I didn't put on my iPod. This song just didn't entrance me like their other songs did. It was too slow and...well...boring...4/10 -Sticks and Stones: Pretty corny, but still a good song that a lot of people, including me, could relate to, 8/10 -Protecting Me: A very sweet song dedicated to their parents, 8/10 -Slow Down: I really hope they make a video for this one. I love this song! Definatly the best beat out of all of them, even "Rush", 10/10 Do You Beleive In Magic?-As I said before, good song, BAD remake, 5/10 Walking On Sunshine- Better, but still not there...personally, I think these girls should stop with the remakes...6/10  All in all, probably one of the best CDs I've ever purchased! 
 Early in Season 2 you can tell things were really rolling for this series.  It debuted mid-season the previous year and really piqued the interests of its audience. Magic jammies that can make you Superman...what kid wouldn't want one?  Younger viewers could immediately identify with this, but older viewers could see the logic in that with power comes responsibility.  Not to mention the comedy of someone trying to use such a gift without instructions!  The entire series is super-clean so that the entire family can enjoy it together.  You simply don't get shows like this anymore.  The age shows a bit, especially in the suits and hairstyles of the actors, some of the drama music, and of course, the automobiles.  But you can tell great care had been taken in the storage of the original films, many look just like they did, if not better, than when they originally aired.  Sometimes the sound is a little iffy (ala Star Wars episode IV), but not to the extent it is a distraction.  There are only 2 disappointing things with this DVD series:   1. There aren't enough seasons to buy! 2. Some of the original scoring, generally carefully-placed and well-performed covers of popular tunes sung by Joey Scarbury and Mike Post, are missing.  You have certainly read this in other reviews. Scarbury's distinctive renditions that really made tunes such as "Rocket Man" and "Eve of Distruction" feel as if they were an integral part of the show, now gone, lessen the overall impact of the series.  Fortunately, some of the original music is performed by the duo is still there.  If you were to ask me 2 things I remember about the show the most, it would be 1. The "Chemistry" and performance of the actors and 2. The scoring.  You need go no further than the show's theme to see how much the music meant to the series.  Still, I give Seasons 1 & 2 5 stars.  Season 3 is really the only season I would consider otherwise.  When you consider all the pressures of the entertainment business, law"suits" from DC Comics, and bad time spot placement (i.e, up against Night Rider and Joni Loves Chachi in the days VCR's were a luxury item), you can see why the writing and production suffered a bit in Season 3, although it's still very enjoyable.  With all the distraction, it's almost amazing it lasted as long as it did.  On the same token, this series does what many fail to do: it leaves you wanting more.  The bonus interviews are a very nice touch and satisfy some of the hunger.  So I still give 5 stars to Season 3.  It deserves it just like the rest of the series 
 Begin with a set of specific written goals   Understand the reasons behind your ambitions   Identify the resources you need to achieve success   Develop a scheduled plan of action    These are very good basics, basics that people will listen to but winners WILL FOLLOW.  They may seem like just mere common sense tips, but if taken to heart, these guideposts will change one's life I believe.  I have had problems with my organizational skills and focus throughout my life and throughout my career my focus has been getting sharper, but I'm humble enough to realize that these things can help me.    Zig may sound a lot like a TV Preacher, but he is full of common sense that I fear not enough people actually apply in their lives.  One needs to get past his southern drawl and to the core of his powerful messages.   He is also criticized by some for overemphasizing Christianity, and being overzealous in this regard.    I didn't hear him say the word "GOD" once during his presentation.  
 My 2 year old son has all the Bob movies, and we got this one for him just before Christmas. Its good, but not as good at the three that came before this one. It seems a little bit of a knock off, as not all the segments have anything to do with Christmas, but my son loves it, so we watch it, and watch it, and watch it.. 
   In the right circumstances, do we all have a capacity for violence?   Lehane's second outing in the Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro series is a truly dark and intense tale.  First, the two are hired by a woman, who believes that the mafia is threatening her son's life.  But things aren't as they seem, and suddenly a series of crucifixion murders grip the Boston neighborhood.  One of the victims is the woman's son.  The police and FBI question Kenzie and Gennaro but are left dumbfounded.  Kenzie only hope is to confront a deranged serial killer who is imprisoned for similar killings.  The incarcerated psychopath will only talk to Kenzie, and it's clear that he has intimate knowledge about Patrick and the people he loves.     By the end, I really liked the book, particularly the clever unveiling of murderer.  This was one mystery that had some substance.  Patrick Kenzie struggles with his own capacity for violence and also realizes how quickly he can lose those whom he loves.  The pace was a bit slow at the start, but the rousing finish easily made up for it.  Another criticism is the sheer number of people that the reader is introduced to at the start of the book. This was especially true of the laundry list of murder victims.  Overall, the mystery is well plotted and the writing is taut, but my main problem with this book is that I didn't really like the main protagonists.  Patrick is extremely loyal to his numerous friends, but I can't see why he has so many. Angie also seemed quite flat and unimpressive.  In the end, the story was so compelling that it really didn't matter. 
 The Black Panther Party is perhaps one of the most misunderstood political movements in the U.S. due to government disinformation and harrassment and misperceptions magnified over the years that fiction is now considered fact.  In one volume, the history of the party from 1966-1982 and beyond is presented through original writings from rank & file members and those in leadership roles and scholarly papers that cover a variety of issues, including inner-party gender relations, how the party fit into the Third World revolutionary movement and the grass-roots movement in each chapter to assist residents of all ages with nutrition and health-care.  Perhaps most important is the extensive footnotes after each piece, which assists the reader in pursuing further material and dismisses any criticism that the author has some ulterior agenda by allowing opinion to supercede a conclusion based on research.  Founded because the power structure maintained what I consider a plantation mentality to Black people in general and Black urban areas in particular and ultimately destroyed by the same power structure due to its programs of empowerment and solidarity, the real Black Panther Party may never truly be uncovered.    But this book starts that process and it is as important a retrospective as any that has been published.    
 With a four year old in the house, our videos get dirty and make the heads on the video machine dirty too.  This tape cleaner works very very well and is easy to use; just 10 seconds on "play" does the trick.  I bought a second one for our weekend house 
 I have always been impressed by the work of the Kepner-Tregoe team because their methodologies really work.   My first encounter with their work was the mastering - and application - of their Problem Solving & Decision Making (PSDM)strategies in the late 70's/early 80's, while I was a practising engineer. Subsequent fruitful encounters include reading - and assimilating - Tregoe's Vision at Work and Top Management Strategy (both of which are great works) when I was a General Manager.   This book should have been available when I was still working in the corporate world. Anyway, I am very pleased to have bought and perused this wonderful book, which I will now add to my Strategic Thinking and Strategic Leadership bookshelf.   I particularly enjoyed digesting the authors' practical approach to strategy formulation, which has been extensively covered in the book. The attendant case studies - field-tested - have been well selected and the process of working out their integrated model to help readers to understand - and eventually apply - has also been well crafted.   I also like their way of posing pertinent questions to think through some of the process steps.   All practising managers must get hold of this book. In terms of depth and breadth in the strategic thinking process, as well as the clarity in writing and presentation, I would rate this book in the same genre as Michel Robert's strategic thinking books. Across the board, the authors' writing in the book is crisp and succinct, and I really appreciate authors who write this way 
 love this workout,real combination of cardio and weights ,feel great when im done,as my strength increases I add weight and step risers 
 An excellent book for coursework in both undergrad and first year medschool, plus the tie-in with LWW Illus. Pharm. is a great duet.  Our first year biochem was horribly taught, this book helped immensely, and look forward to using it for quick reference review in year 2 and Board study 
 I really enjoyed this book.  Learned a bit of how HP operates.  Of course, HP is no longer the HP described in this book 
 Well, I really think I needed this book. I was anxious to say the least but when the baby arrived, i had no idea what to expect or what to do. My wife's books did not apply to me. I had a lot of mixed feelings about the whole thing but could not tell anyone about it. Dr. Goldman's book was the only one that seemed to let me feel what I wanted or needed to feel. I wasn't filled with joy automatically. A lot of people have been attacked for having one feeling or another or not having certain feelings-especially in the delivery room. I am in love with my baby now but I'm glad that it's ok to let those feelings develop without the guilt. That's not to say that the book is full of doom and gloom--it's NOT--it was ME that was full of doom and gloom...at first. There were some things in the book that made it ok for me to have mixed thoughts for a while. The book was a breath of honest, fresh air!! What a relief. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Fans of Star Trek can't get enough, and STAR TREK: CONSTELLATIONS is a collection of stories that adds to the adventures of the cast of the Star Trek universe. Here are untold tales from such notable contributors as Stuart Moore, Jeff Bond, and more. There's even a story from Tokyopop's latest Star Trek manga. Unlike other single-book stories this is designed as part of the series' fortieth anniversary celebration and gathers new original tales designed to feel like 'lost' episodes - and in this endeavor it succeeds well: any who miss Star Trek will want this book!

 HOW WE DIE came into my life when I needed it most--as I faced the impending passing of my mother. Dr. Nuland's words were not only medical and accurate, they were also comforting. We need to know how to die, how to prepare for it, and how to recover from it. We live in a culture where dying is hidden away in hospitals and our lack of experience leaves us absolutely terrified. HOW WE DIE calms our fears, and even though words cannot take away the shock and sorrow of death, this book brings much needed and timely solace. 
 This book probes into the human mind and soul, always wondering what will happen next.  I was hoping for more theological insights. It had more romance, mystery, and just plain novel that I had expected.  But an overall thought provoking book on divorce within the church and how one can be redeemed in Christ.  Good book for a christian or a non-christian 
 It's 1897, and everyone is happy because summer vacation is close. Well, not everyone. Twelve-year-old Nathan Tanner just got expelled from boarding school because of his temper and bad behavior. He has no friends and doesn't get along well with his family. While riding his bicycle one day, he meets the Breaker Boys, who do dangerous work in the coal mines for his father, a coal mine operator.  Nathan starts hanging out with the Breaker Boys every day and becomes very good friends with them, especially Johnny. However, Nathan must hide the fact that he's the boss's son. As Johnny and Nathan grow closer, Nathan learns that, because of unfair wages and treatment, some of the mine workers are forming unions and going on strike. Because of this, tensions rise in Nathan's family. Will he take his family's side on the issue and help them, or will he betray them to help his friend?  In her first novel, GUERRILLA SEASON, Pat Hughes traveled back in time to show readers how different life was because of war, how children's lives were affected by war and why they were forced to become adults so early. THE BREAKER BOYS, which is a fascinating second novel from Hughes, is no different.     --- Reviewed by Ashley Hartlau 
 I'm surprised to see some of the bad reviews here. I throughly enjoyed this book and finished it in a day. While some may see the plots and characters "formulaic", heck, they work-and I might add,similar plotlines have worked for some of bestselling romance writers as well for years. "If it ain't broke why fix it?"   Logan is a great "tortured" hero. 30, been around the block and then some with many lovers, but had only one "true"love that betrayed him. Madeline is the perfect yin to his yang. Sweet, full of love and patience, but still a strong woman. Unlike others, I found it likable that here is a regency heroine who refused to sit back and be betrothed to a truly horrid person just because it's the "right" thing for her parents interests. She was willing to accept whatever fate her actions caused, and that would have been huge in those days.  It was refreshing to see characters, hero & heroine both, who were basically abused growing up (he was physically, she was neglected/emotionally put down) that went on with their lives and became productive members of society rather than let their misfortune make then abusive themselves. The sub-plot dealing with these issues were very engrossing to read.  The playhouse storyline was refreshing as most regencies deal strictly with the "ton", so this was a unique change of pace. This book struck me as similar in chemistry and plot movement to some other well known authors like Johanna Lindsey and Amanda Quick. I think Miss Kleypas has a long and illustrious career ahead of her and will in time become as popular as some of these authors if not more.  The love scenes are highly sensual-I found nothing "icky" about the fact that she was 18 and he 30-hell, the man her parents wanted her for was probably at least 50, so what's the big deal? Marriages with this age difference were common in this time period, so I didn't find it implausible in the least.  BTW-I think some reviewers of romances here should get a grip-it's just a romance people! If you have the need to nitpick every little nuance, "historical accuracy" and scene-MAYBE you should try reading another genre, Duh??!!? Potential buyers should take a few bad reviews with a grain of salt. If you enjoy romances for the pure entertainment that they are, then I feel you'll enjoy this book.  Highly entertaining, highly recommended 5 stars 
 I was looking for a video to spike my 2+ year old daughter's interest in potty training and this one did the job beautifully. She loves the story about the little bear and the silly songs and is now asking about a potty and big kid underwear. The video's gentle tone also complements the various potty books I've purchased for bedtime reading. I don't expect an animated video to present the same level of detail as a video with real kids so in contrast to other reviewers it doesn't bother me that the bear doesn't wash his hands(paws?). My husband and I can deliver that message more effectively anyway. This video is a nice soft sell introduction to potty training and I recommend it for that purpose. 
   Back in the early 1960s when I was a high schooler getting into music, I took this book out of the library and took this book out of the library, and took this book out of the library.    People trying to find great folk songs with both wit and wonder and laughter, heart ache and beauty probably have been doing this since Sandburg published this book in the 1920s.  Being so familiar with this book, back in the day, and still today, I can identify different folk singers who have a repertoire of traditional songs by the ones who like myself studied this book and learned to play its songs, and those who had learned from the Lomax Collections, though in all the big Lomax books, there were credits to the inspiration and work Sanburg put into this book, as well as songs taken from this book.  Sanburg wasn't a folklorist, but a poet and someone who liked to sing these songs and play the guitar. He includes a few songs that aren't folk by any description like the very funny "Horse Named Bill" written by a friend of Sandburg's named Sinclair Lewis whom you might heard of!  The legions of folkies who once had only this book and the Lomax collections have spewed forth generations of serious scholars of folk music in this country and the world. Specialized monographs can be found on Kentucky fiddling or the musics of Mali, on down picking banjo, and Black song before the blues.  With the specialization that has developed over the decades, few would even attempt to write one book and call it the American Songbag.     Especially if you like to sing and play, this book will take you back to an easier time, with some good songs.  You will be surprised at how many of them you know the tune to, even if you can't read the music!  
 Anyone who has ever wanted to read the Old Testament but found it too difficult to understand or to apply to will discover Rabbi Shefa Gold's new book, Torah Journeys, the perfect tool for comprehending and using the messages hidden there. Her book provides a portal from a surface reading into the deeper significance of the stories and their relevance to our lives today.  The Old Testament, also called the Five Books of Moses, the Bible or the Torah, is read by many religions.  Although written from a Jewish perspective and set up to be used as a guide to the weekly Torah portions traditionally read by Jews, Torah Journeys easily can be used by Jew and non-Jew alike to make their reading of this holy text a fulfilling experience. Rabbi Gold has a unique ability to get to the core of a portion and to make it applicable to our lives here and now.  Beginning readers of the Torah often complain that the stories within its pages seem removed from modern life.  They tend to ask, "What does this have to do with me, now?"  Rabbi Gold points them towards the answer to this question with insightful interpretations and useful suggestions on how to use the text in a personal context. For each parsha (portion), Rabbi Gold offers readers the chance to glean both the blessing and the challenge of the text as well as a practice to apply the lesson in a concrete manner. The practices range from meditations to visualizations to chants, all of which are meant to foster spiritual and transformative experiences.  I often have perused Rabbi Gold's website to glean insight into Torah portions.  Now, I use her book, a more detailed version of her website information, as a handy guide. I also have had the pleasure and honor of knowing Rabbi Gold, an approachable and inspirational teacher and leader, for several years.  She has helped me create Shabbat services based on her lovely chants, offered me insights into subjects I am researching and taught me about chant and meditation.  Thus, I can personally recommend her work. So, if you want to bring the Old Testament to life in your own life, read Torah Journeys.  In its pages Rabbi Gold shares her wide range of knowledge of Judaism, Torah and other religious and spiritual traditions as well as her insightful and practical approach to Bible study.   
 the gospel portion of hee haw was always my favorite. good to see the music on the market. Remindful of childhood memories of going to church with our parents (who both passed away in 2000 age 55 and 59) 
 If you want to learn about stochastic calculus, this is the gold standard. Certainly a challenge, but if you can answer all the questions posed in the book you will have a very thorough knowledge of BM, stochastic integration with respect to BM, SDE's, and the SDE/PDE relationship.   While this is a great book, I do have a couple complaints. First of all there a points in the book where overly complicated notation can obscure the point being made. Secondly, since the book does not cover semimartingale integration, topics like the quadratic variation process (which are still important for things like representing a martingale as a time-changed BM) are spread throughout the book and can be difficult to find.   I recommend reading Rogers&Williams "Diffusions, Makov Processes, and Martingales" Vols I&II in addition to this book. Not only does it give a second (and sometimes easier) point of view on the somewhat difficult topic of stochastic analysis, but also covers some topics in greater generality including integration wrt a general semimartingale.  Finally, a warning to those who have interest but are not proper mathematics students. This book presupposes a fair amount of mathematical maturity - if you don't have a good understanding of real analysis and measure-theoretic probability you probably won't understand anything 
 My dad bought me this over 10 years ago, and I've read it countless times.  Bushmiller's art personifies a Platonic space stretching through the mind's suburbia, and this thick tomb has lots of strips from Nancy's many eras, giving you a good picture of the strip's evolution.  Also some great historical material and some of the weird spinoffs of Nancy (the MAD magazine parodies and some abstract art stuff).  If you've never read this essential strip, this is the book to get.  If someone would just bother to reprint it.. 
 On BBC Radio 4, one is required to choose ten peices of music and a luxury item, added to shakespeare's works and a Bible, to take with you on a desert island.  This outstanding book would be my luxury item. Not only would the survival elements save my life, the range of accessable information and the wealth of stories and floklore would save my sanity. It's fantastic 
 Let's face it, Van Damme has dished out some rather campy movies in the past 7 or so years.  However, there seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel thanks to this movie, along with the recent "Wake of Death."    "In Hell" is a raw and darker film than his normal material.  Don't expect his stamped karate moves, because it doesn't take place during this flick.  Instead, we are treated with gritty, no-holds barred rumbles.    To top it off, Van Damme begins to show signs of some acting depth.  I'm not talking Oscar winner, but for Damme, this is probably the best work he has done that provides a sense of substance to his character.    A moment or two of akward cheesy-ness appears, but doesn't hamper the overall experience of the movie at all. Even if you are not a Van Damme fan, like I "once" was, you should give this flick a shot.  Don't expect a masterpiece and I believe you will be surprisingly surprised 
 With her great body, huge dark eyes and unsmiling countenance, Marie Windsor, "the Queen of the Bs," seemed to personify film noir. In one of her most memorable roles, she plays in THE NARROW MARGIN a mobster's widow who must be transported by a police officer (Charles MacGraw, another noir staple) on a train from Chicago to LA with assassins on board--who do not know what she looks like. Memorably dolled up in fetishistic strappy high heels, cheap dangling earrings and a tight dress, Windsor is fortunate to have a director here worthy of her in Richard Fleischer, whose inventive use of camera placement and mise-en-scene seems to make perfect use of the narrow confines of the train's corridors and Pullman rooms. There are several sequences--most memorably the famous initial attack in the Chicago tenement stairwell, the fight in the men's bathroom, and the stopover in La Junta, CO--where he seems to anticipate Brian de Palma in his brilliant use of editing and camera placement to indicate several things going on at once on different points in a confined space; he also makes memorable use of window reflections to heighten suspense (and, in the finale,to further the story). The only downside of the film is Jacqueline White, vaguely reminsicent of Elinor Donahue,  as MacGraw's wholesome love interest on the train: she seems to have wandered in from a different movie altogether. One of the most beloved of all film noirs, this comes with a bizarrely superfluous commentary from director William Friedkin, who seeems to imagine an audience who has never been to a movie before in their lives 
 Experiencing The Pig in the Pond with preschoolers is a delight. Three to Five year olds will be fully engaged by the rich illustrations and simple text--words full of meaning to young children. My preschool class waited with anxious anticipation to see what that very hot pig would do AND what would happen when Nelligan came home. The end is silly and satisfying and just what the children were waiting for. This has become a much loved favorite in our classroom 
 I bought Alison Weir's THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII to read at the beach. I thought it would be helpful to have a refresher course on Henry VIII and his ladies from one of the  best popular historical writers and scholars. I could hardly put this book down. It is excellent and surpasses most novels in readability and intrigue. Since Henry was married to Katherine of Aragon the longest, there is more about her and I learned more than ever before about that stubborn, passionate, implacable queen. Henry seemed to have so much guilt attached to his marriage with her that one concludes that she was, as he himself said "buxom" in the bedchamber. She was a saint but also a woman. When Anne Boleyn enters the story, one tragedy unfolds after another.  However, Weir did not explore all of the sufferings the English people experienced due to Henry's dissolution of the monasteries and break with Rome. I got more of a sense of Jane Seymour's personality from this book, and Anne of Cleves as well. I thought the treatment of Katherine Howard was too conventional, with the same old story of the slutty adulterous. Weir claims that Katherine became sexually active at age 12 or 13. I would not call that being sexually active, I call it being molested or raped. She was a child, for heaven's sake, and whatever happened to her, it may have contributed to some of her later behaviors. I felt sorry for Katherine Parr, who survived Henry only to be made to suffer by her true love, Thomas Seymour. An overall fantastic book - highly recommended 
 I'm amazed that this golf book doesn't seem to have been recognised for the gem that it is. By far the best golf book there is, and I've read over 100. Boomer was WAY ahead of his time, and I'm convinced a lot of the more recent golf instruction authors have been influenced by his work. And yet, this book is still the best in communicating the feel of the golf swing. 
 This easy to read book really allows you to tap into who you really are and what obstacles, negative chatter, stumbling blocks you put up which in turn causes you not to grow, change or do what you really want to do.  The book contains some wonderful tools to use to erase some of this negative energy from your life.  I give this book to my coaching clients for more in-depth work on themselves 
 Dave Marsh is a Good Writer too me.be it I agree with Him or not I respect the perspective He comes with because you can tell by His writing He truly cares about Which Artists&Acts He is talking about.He is a very detailed Writer&has fun doing His job.I've followed His work for Years.this is a tight Book with different takes&things involved within it 
 You will not find a more spectacular looking HD-DVD. This is the movie to have to show off your HD system to your friends. Simply amazing. Pay no attention to the trolls who give this one star, they are just trying to promote blu-ray and have most likely not even seen this movie on HD-DVD.

 I bought this watch because it was inexpensive and had an alarm. It continues to be my favorite watch.   I wondered if the band would hold up to wear and tear.  It has held up well showing little wear or dirt.   I bought it in blue and it matches many colors surprisingly well.  It keeps perfect time, the alarm is reliable and I get compliments on how it looks.  It is not like the usual alarm sport watch  that is bulky and ugly.   I have even forgotten to change it and even had it on with dress clothes. Any other sport watch I would have taken off and hidden away but I wore this one anyway.  This watch is a great bargain 
 Most people I know who have viewed this film fall into two categories. On one side there are those who hate it, while on the other are those who like it. I am of the latter group. This is not a comedy, although one gets the feeling that with so many absurdities in the lives of the characters that make us laugh, it appears to be a comedy. However, make no mistake about it, this brilliant film is more than that. It is a biting satire of a very dark side of life. One I wouldn't wish on anyone.   I didn't know what to make of this film when I first viewed it. And I knew it was darker than a dark-comedy. Surely the director was making another statement in this film? And maybe he was. The dysfunctional life of Vanessa (Reese Witherspoon) and the even more dysfunctional life of the  sociopathic Bob Wolverton (Keifer Sutherland) converge in one hell of a nightmare.   This satire on the life of Vanessa as a modern day "Little Red Riding Hood" meeting Bob the "Big Bad Wolf" while on her way to grandma's house was like a punch in the face when I first saw this film. I didn't think of it as a comedy--as many do, but actually a sad commentary on one part of american society. This film hits you in the gut. Even though some parts of the film are funny: the disturbing parts are much more powerful. Highly recommended 
 I've been really impressed about this book: - strongly rooted in reality - covers all areas used in managing projects - give a strong sensation the author got the knowledge from practice, not from books only - concise, clear, easy to understand and put in practice for the experienced project managers - useful to be used line a guide (or bible, whatever you like) to come back from time to time in order remember how to plan and implement, ro to refine your understanding  The less experienced project managers might find it too condensed or too "dry". Do not be affraid about this. Just come back to this book a little bit later, and you can discover you understand better what seems to be complicated at the first lecture. The beginners in Project Management might want to use it as a start point in improving knowledge in different PM areas where they feel less experienced. Overall if you easily read and underastand this book, this means you have a good level of understanding and expertise. If you feel not all chapters are crystal clear, this might be a sign you have to work more on different PM areas.    
 "The Ice Storm"  DVD:  It's the 1970's and it's the upper-middle-class suburbs and it's Thanksgiving.  Our story here shows us a slice of life of two different families:  the Hood family (Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci) and the Carver family (Jamey Sheridan, Sigourney Weaver, Elijah Wood, Adam Hann-Byrd).  They are neighbors, they are friends, the children are friends, the children might even be dating.  And, they all are so cool that they have a good coating of ice on them.  They struggle to break free and to move and to feel something, but they pick the worst possible ways to do this:  alcohol, drugs, affairs, and "key parties" (random partner-swapping at parties for the alleged grown-ups).  Meanwhile, the kids are left with near-total freedom and absolutely no meaningful standards for their behavior.  Everyone pushes the limits on everything, in an effort to prove they are alive and not totally numb.  I had to think about this review quite a bit before writing it.  I wanted to give it five stars for how well it portrayed this story, these characters, and this social-temporal niche.  I wanted to give it one star, because it was very painful to watch, and I wanted to smack everyone in the film until they woke up and started behaving themselves.  I also want to add that I take issue with the editorial review, that this film "sums up America in the early 1970s by focusing on the arrival of the sexual revolution in the 'burbs."  I was a teenager in the 1970's, but not in New England, and I grew up in a "blue-collar" neighborhood; life bore very little resemblance to the lifestyles of the characters in this film.  There was some teenage drug use, but the parents would have made them suffer for it, if they were caught.  There was teenage sexual acting-out, but the parents would have made them suffer for it, if they were caught.  Anyway, now that I'm back down off my soapbox, I will say that, putting the pain and frustration aside, I give this movie four stars for how well it portrayed its story.  And, I'll never watch it again 
 Rory Stewart's account of his walking trip from Herat to Kabul, Afghanistan one year after the fall of the Taliban is either an extraordinary act of courage or sheer stupidity. Fortunately for Stewart, his knowledge of tribal differences, local customs and an ability to speak Dari, the language of the Afghans west of Kabul make this journey possible.  He must have kept a superb journal as his recounting of the walk is very impressive.  The reader is left though asking: "Why did he expose himself to such danger?"  The winter weather was awful.  Tribal rivalries would have easily eliminated him.  When you look at his picture on the back flap of the book, you are left even more incredulous.  "What drives this guy?"  I am now reading Prince of the Marshes, his second book.  He recounts his story of being a "Governor" in one of the southern Iraqi provinces near Basra. Stewart is no Lawrence of Arabia.  He does however exhibit a lot of similar traits:  courage, to the point of stupidity, determination and an avid recorder of events around him. For anyone interested in understanding the current Afghanistan (not what is filtered through the news), this book is an eye-opener 
 Wow!! I have read several of the 'negative' reviews here and can only conclude (after viewing the DVD four times and counting) that what may be going on with these folks is something they themselves simply don't understand (about themselves!).  They cannot or will not accept that here with Lang Lang, as with Evgeny Kissin (ever notice?)  the world is being introduced to the next and even greater generation of pianistic virtuosos, young prodigies who can do everything that Horowitz and even Lizst  ever did and more... I have no doubt those two would agree were they alive today.  Karajan wept (for joy)when he heard the young Kissin perform Chopin's Fantasy in F# minor, Mehta was so taken with Kissin's performance under his baton that he could not refrain from hugging the young boy after a stellar performance... Andre Watts,  not often praising his contemporaries, mused about finding the nearest bridge to jump off after hearing Kissin play realizing he was not in the same league and one other recent winner of an International Competition had to pull his car over to the side of the road, he was so taken with Kissin.... yes, I know it seems like I forgot we are talking about Lang Lang.... Lang Lang can do everything Kissin can and maybe more...Are we to believe that these aforementioned individuals are musical idiots prone to such actions?!!  Folks! accept it, embrace it and thank God for it!... just as he did when simultaneously brought Chopin and Liszt to our world in the early 1800's (they were the same age except for a year) He has now given us another Double Blast of Pianistic Glory in Kissin and Lang Lang!  Pity those who can't get beyond their envy, jealously, general jadedness with life... or whatever ails them...  they need help, lots of help!  As for me and many like me (BTW, it doesnt count for much but I am a pianist myself)... we are so grateful and blessed to have these 2 young men and the miracle of DVD technology to bring their concerts right into our living room! 
 This is a fantastic Popper. The only reason I will not give it 5 stars is for its aluminum caseing. it is however, the best popcorn i have ever made. only one small spoon of oil is needed and the taste is great. there is virtually no stinky popcorn smell that the microvable popcorn leaves. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT 
 Now that I've finished all three volumes of the Baroque Cycle, I feel qualified to leave an opinion. I enjoyed them tremendously. If history had been taught like this at my school, I'd have retained a great deal more information. Most of us weren't fortunate enough to have had many (any?) teachers with the varied skills of Mr. Stephenson.  This series of books is very ambitious and, I'm happy to report, very accomplished. The scholarship behind it is impressive and expertly woven into an extremely entertaining, wide ranging, narrative. I won't provide a plot synopsis; previous reviewers have done so admirably. I do wish to encourage you to try these books if you even think that you might like them. I disagree with others who call the books overwritten. They certainly are long and wordy but not overly so to my taste. N.S has a gift for poetic description and to abbreviate it or otherwise "reign him in" would be criminal.  The only other N.S. I've read is Cryptonomicon. It was also a great experience. Where Cryptonomicon is a headlong thrill-ride, The Baroque Cycle slows down and spreads out. I didn't expect to become so absorbed in T.B.C. but the abundance of detail concerning the way people lived, how commerce differed, etc. became addicting to me. The characters whose vicissitudes drive the plot are intriguing and endearing.  The books reminded me of The Sot Weed Factor by John Barth. It's set in the same time period, it's also a "faux historical" novel but S.W.F. has a more focussed and quite dizzying brilliance that matches the humor but lacks the warmth of The Baroque Cycle. I'm also reminded of the great books by the late Robertson Davies. His Deptford Trilogy and Cornish Triology are like T.B.C. in their ability to cast convoluted plot arcs through reams of pages while reaching a satisfying conclusion. Mr. Stephenson may not quite reach the near perfect architecture and intellectual prowess of Mr. Davies but very few do.  Quicksilver, The Confusion and The System of the World were great companions to me. I'll miss them.  
 "Innocent Voices" is one of those films that simply blows you away with its incredibly moving story, great acting, directing, and cinematography. I had the privilege of seeing this film at Talk Cinema, where you see films in theaters on Saturday or Sunday morning weeks or months before they are released -- so there are no reviews to hinder your pure enjoyment of the film. We walk into the movie theater with no idea what we're going to see that morning. The 400 film fans in the theater that sunny September 2005 morning had no idea what to expect from this "Innocent Voices" film which, sadly, got virtually no theatrical distribution in Chicagoland.  I'll not repeat the summary of the film that others have posted here. It's the film's impact that reflects so well on the power of this medium.  After the closing credits ran, there was total silence in the auditorium, broken only by the soft sound of sobbing all around. And then you realized you were among those in tears. I haven't seen such a reaction to a film since "Shindler's List." It is hard to describe the emotional impact of this often funny, but ultimately very moving semi-autobiographical film. It's a shame you can't see in the theaters any more, but I strongly recommend seeing "Innocent Voices" on DVD with a loved one with whom you can share a healthy cry at the end. You will be changed.  
 Fiestaware ROCKS!  The turquoise place setting is beautiful...It is much brighter than the pictures on amazon.com...Fiestaware is functional, calssic and fun- I love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this.  I highly recommend mixing and matching Fiestaware. I mix up colors that you wouldn't normally expect to go together and they usually look great 
 The Celtic Dragon Tarot, while a serious deck with a very helpful interpretation book, will simply charm the socks off of you with some of the adorable little dragons. J.D. Conway's extensive knowledge is legendary (see 'Dancing with Dragons', or any of her other books) and Lisa Hunt's artwork is unique, at times charming with her little dragons, spectacular with the adult dragons. Some of her people may look a bit strange, but the overall look and feel of the deck is wonderful. Out of the five decks I own, it is my favorite 
 Isn't that an odd thing to say about a book whose title starts with the word "sex?"    Well, around 1964 one of my parents brought this book home, although neither of them would ever confess to the deed.  Whoever it was, they did me a big favor.  When the folks weren't watching, I swiped the book and devoured it in a single long sitting.  Helen Gurley Brown should have entitled this masterwork "All the Hard-Nosed Things that Young Women in the So-Called Pre-Feminist Era Need to Know about Money, Career, Independence, Women's Rights, and The Way Things Unfortunately Are.  And Oh Yes, Sex.  That."  However, the book would undoubtedly have sold fewer copies if the title had truly reflected the contents, so it's just as well they hyped the sex part.    Under the impression that I was going to get to read some really naughty stuff, I studied Brown's book with the intensity I would later reserve for pre-calculus.  Brown was the friendly, more experienced adult ("Aunt Helen," I liked to think of her) who cut the BS and told you how it really was with respect to a number of important subjects, often contradicting the messages of the dominant 60's culture, as it materialized later in the decade.    Money?  Girl, Woodstock or not, you will need it when you are no longer "pristinely young," so get a career and earn it.  You will appreciate the freedom and self-respect it brings you.  Do the very best you can with whatever abilities you have and the education you can get, and the rewards will carry you through the inevitable bad times that everybody faces.  Beauty?  Even if you are gorgeous, don't put all your eggs in that basket, because your beauty will fade, and then where will you be if that's the only card you ever played?  Love?  It is NOT all you need, no matter what the Beatles say.  Marriage?  Fine, fabulous (Brown herself has been married over forty years), but don't pin all your reasons for living - or your financial survival -- on a guy.  Guys are just fallible human beings.  Don't give up your ability to stand on your own two feet when you fall in love, because there are no guarantees in life, ever.  As Brown eloquently put it, in middle age (or at any time before) a man can leave a woman "like dishes in the sink" if he wants to badly enough.  Exercise and a healthy diet?  Essential to self-respect.  Property ownership (or at least having a fine apartment)?  Also essential, particularly when you get older; living in a garage apartment furnished with orange crates is cute when you're twenty, but pathetic when you're forty.  I came of age in the late 60's and early 70's, when the culture was telling us to tune in, turn on, and drop out.  Don't conform, don't join the establishment, don't become the man or the woman in the gray flannel suit, don't throw away your life working and forget to smell the roses.  Follow your dreams and the universe will magically provide.    This was good advice as far as it went.  It sounded so great, and it really was well meant and idealistic and heartfelt...if only it had been true.  Unfortunately, it should have been taken with a small but healthy dose of skepticism.  Such as, yes, do follow your dreams, but along the way learn some marketable skills, okay?  However, the cultural mindset discouraged us from planning for the future, or thinking seriously about money, financial issues, and practical things.  We might have known with our minds that the Woodstock generation would eventually get much, much older, but we didn't believe it.    I, however, had Aunt Helen whispering in my ear, so around age thirty I finally rolled up my sleeves, quit hanging out in Austin drinking dark beer and swimming in Barton Springs, and got an advanced degree and a good job -- but did plan things so I still had some time to smell the roses.  I couldn't have done it without her advice.  At the end of the day, although Brown was not considered a "real" feminist, and in fact came in for a great deal of scorn on that account, she helped me every bit as much as the rest of them.    She wasn't into rhetoric, ideology, or internecine wars with the sisters, she just gave good hardheaded advice about the way things were, like it or not, that's city hall so just deal with it. She liked men.  They were people, they had their problems, but generally they were pretty nice.  This was quite a relief to those of us who liked them too, even though there were times when it wasn't politically correct to dwell on it.  She just didn't believe that liking men required her to give up everything else worthwhile in life, or her ability to provide for herself.    Yeah yeah, like just about everybody else I take issue with her rather Darwinian attitude about carrying on with married men.  However, as the writer Molly Ivins would say, she had the guts to tell young women how the cow ate the cabbage.  I honor her for that.       
 Our two older kids basically didn't fall asleep on their own for a long time, as well as woke up quite frequently at nights. We were big followers of Sears method. I think, our nervous system was quite drained as a result of bad and insufficient sleep.  With our third child we finally decided to try to teach him to go to sleep and sleep on his own and our pediatrician recommended this book.  Must note that, as the book warns you, it was NOT an easy thing for us as he cried for about 10-20 minutes for almost a week before falling asleep. He also did wake at night two-three times. We did come in after increasing intervals to be with him for a minute or so and it seemed to help him to cry less and less.  After two weeks he started sleeping through the whole night which was like a miracle to us. Now, a month later he sleeps 11-12 hours at night.   It is not true that we became desensitized because our 3 year old still wakes up sometimes and we have to respond to her calls.  The most important lesson from the book we learned is  1) Baby remembers how he falls asleep, i.e. associations. So if he falls asleep on his own when he goes to bed he is more likely to fall asleep when he wakes up at night (which is BTW quite normal). So if we have to breastfeed him to make him to sleep he will ask for it everytime he wakes up. 2) Maintaining schedule is hugely important due to the inherent body rythms.  Good luck to everyone 
 I found this book to be full of real to me cases.  The transfer of easy to use diagnostic tools then, to current client systems, is unprecedented!  Very helpful and easy to read and apply 
 David Lean had a hand in directing this Noel Coward film and it shows in the documentary quality of the film.  The movie is "The story of a ship" as we are told right off.  I find the flashback technique to tell that story contrived and by now a hopeless cliché.  When the picture gets bleary for one more recalled memory, you may struggle to suppress a laugh or a groan--but, darn it, the movie works.  The ship emerges from the Scottish ship yard, goes to sea as war breaks out, and suffers casualties at sea, and, shockingly, ashore.  It takes a pretty hard heart not to shed a tear when Noel Coward says goodbye to his crew.  Made during wartime the film features fine performances by the young John Mills and the very young Richard Attenborough.  You recognize other British character actors.  Celia Johnson and Noel Coward persevere with the stiffest of upper lips 
 After only 5 days of following Joyce's instructions and performing The Bathing Suit Workout, I am already seeing a difference in the way my body looks. This is a great workout, it is very easy to follow. Anyone at any  fitness level could do this book and get maximum results. I believe that  there was a printing error, it doesn't take 10 minutes a day. It takes me  30-50 minutes to complete the routine. It is the best 50 minutes I spend  though because I am getting incredibly toned and my heart rate is up the  whole time too so that I am getting a great aerobic workout. Even at 50  minutes the workout goes by very quickly. Before you know it you are done  and feeling reshreshed and energized. Joyce is very sincere and  encouraging. She will do everything she can to help you achieve your goals.  I have corresponded with her several times via email and I am amazed at how  quickly she responds back. EVERYBODY needs this book! It is worth every  penny. Enjoy 
 I was really impressed with this book. I've read a quite few books on the business of photography lately, and along with Lou Jacob's "The Big Picture" I think this book should be essential reading for all commercial photographers.   I found the chapters on promotion, networking, sales technique and debt collection extremely useful. However I didn't give this book 5 stars because I found the authors stance on copyright a bit limp wristed (i.e. you can licence images for exclusive unlimited use, in perpetuity - so why would you ever need to hand over copyright?) and the advice on writing your own terms and conditions just seems down right dangerous.  Other than that I think "The Real Business of Photography" is brilliant 
 Chevely: "Sometimes. But it is such a difficult pose to keep up."  Perhaps not so well known as "The Importance of Being Earnest," this has all the same banter, manners, and sharp-eyed look at the crumbling edge of the upper crust in Vistorian England. It pleases the attentive listener at many levels. Considered only as a stream of one-liners and clever quips, it delivers all you could ask for.   But because it's Wilde, it's also a wild tirade against the mannered (sometimes ill-mannered) gentry. Behind that, it has a good deal to say about tolerance for the flaws of any fallible human - and Wilde could speak on human flaws with rare authority. And, like any truly great work, its examination of honesty (and dis-) reveals a good bit about today's world, a century later.  I'm not normally a reader of plays. I don't have that inner ear that brings words on the page to life. Wilde gives me some idea what that experience must be like, and I'm grateful for it.  //wiredweir 
 Very interesting book about the history, tactics & strategies of karate from the old China and Okinawa. This book really open our eyes to understand more about the roots and important principles of Martial Arts.  Soke Leif Hermansson, 9 dan hanshi karate & kobudo Swede 
 For anyone who wants to gain an understanding of the Chinese people, this is a good place to start.  With unusual candor and insight (especially for someone in his twenties), Mr. Hessler uses anecdotes to relay his observations of Chinese life and perspective.  An enjoyable read, both because it is well-written and because it is very interesting (and even humorous) 
 Season 3 of this show is even better than the first two seasons. This is a show about a community -- the kids, the parents, and how everyone interact. The actors playing the various people in this show do a great job of making you either love them or hate them, and that is the mark of good acting.  This is an addictive show that really plays on your emotions. It's not some overly dramatic soap-opera, but it's not a bubble-gum weekly like 90210 either. It's just the right amount of drama stirred up with a healthy dose of emotional impact.  I genuinely recommend this show to anyone who enjoys beautiful people in dramatic situations, and this disc set comes with some fun bonus features as well:  The Bonus Features are  * Making of The Subways music video * What's In a Name? * From Script to Screen - The Party Favor * Gag Reel * Pass The Remote - Scene surfing commentar 
 I received this book as a gift almost 20 years ago.  Now I purchased the book for my daughter.  Although I still read and try other cheesecake recipes I find that I end up resorting to old faithful.  This book will never let you down 
 If you can join a study group - do it! This text is a miracle and my favorite lesson was that of Tonglen.  What it came down to was that I needed to take on the Buddhist practice of Tonglen - having compassion for another's pain without absorbing it but recognizing that they are doing the best they can and we can simply send them love to heal fully.  I never could let a certain person go until I forgave what happened and have compassion for it all. This doesn't mean that I condone certain things in our past situation. It just means that I know that none of it was intentional or malicious on his part. He never intended to hurt me or make me feel bad. He did the best he could and he didn't have the tools to see things objectively from another angle. That is his cross to bear and his lessons to learn. Only he can do it for himself. But I understand now that I couldn't do anything to relieve him of his pain. So I was not a failure and neither was he. The timing was wrong for a relationship on both ends. That said, there was a lot of love on my part for him and his family and that will never change. You always love those who mattered, even if they are gone. I have no intention of doing anything beyond feeling compassionate and forgiving in my heart over things. He is not a bad person and my wish is that one day he sees a healthier way to live and be. Through the practice of tonglen, all I can say for myself is that I now won't close the door on people who truly have changed.   Like the Anais Nin quote: Then the time came when the pain of staying a tight bud become greater than the risk it took to bloom. Tonglen and Buddhist compassion is one way to be the space for one to bloom.  
 This shirt arrived quickly. It is better than was described and very comfortable to wear.  I appreciated the coupon to be used for the next purchase. Thanks Ann Collin 
 lighted keys and ability to program to turn on my tv, made this remote a perfect choice for me. a must have for users who dont have a remote and watch dvd's on the xbox 360 
 This book has great tips for eating healthy and great nutrition information.  I had always thought that the typical food pyramid was wrong.  This one makes more sense.  I was a little disappointed in the recipes.  There are a lot of foods and ingredients I would not buy or use.  However, if you want to lose weight, this book is a must have 
 Wonderful music, Geral LeVert is one of the best singers in the recording world. He will be missed. I now have his entire collection. Thank you so much for your timely manner in sending it. Mary Alic 
 The book offers an anecdotal view on record production and engineering from Les Paul and Buddy Holly in the fifties to Phil Spector, Motown and The Beach Boys in the sixties.  The Beatles sessions @ EMI/Abbey Road was extremely interesting. The coverage of the seventies includes The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, The Who, Queen and Led Zepellin.  It starts to thin out a bit at the end concentrating primarily on the UK scene. Definitely get out your old Albums and CDs while reading this boo 
 The bra was delivered in excellent condition.  Although I am always the same size (38B), I found this 38B a bit snug.  I kept the bra, but find it a bit smaller than I would have liked 
 Welcome to the World, Baby Girl! is another entry in Flagg's catalog of Southern fiction.  The story jumps around in time, between the life of famous, glamorous TV personality Dena Nordstrom in the present day (1970's), and the history of Dena's hometown of Elmwood Springs, Missouri, circa the 1930's and 1940's.  As a jaded Northerner, Dena avoids her past and her association with a backwater place in Missouri.  The story of Elmwood Springs is also the story of Dena's upbringing and the disappearance of her mother, but Dena knows nothing of it.  The reader, however, is certain to be charmed by Elmwood Springs, especially radio personality Neighbor Dorothy, who we are introduced to in the first pages of the novel.  Longtime residents Norma and Mackey Warren (Dena's cousins) provide delightful dialog and antics, and show their love to Dena when she returns home after a long absence.  The title of the novel is perfect--Dena thought she was worldly and all-knowing when she was on top of the NY television world.  In reality, there was a whole world in little old Elmwood Springs that she needed to learn about to become a complete person.  The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of a perfect 5 is that Flagg wrote the book to lead up to a major twist about Dena's past.  Some of the narration and Dena's behavior on the way to this twist is a little weak.  The reader might even get disheartened with the novel in the middle, because of the dragging-out of the lead-up to Dena uncovering her past.  Once Flagg gets into it, however, the reader will say "a-ha! So, that was where she was trying to go! 
 I ordered these glasses just for the adults in my family.  We have had child proof and unbreakable plastic glases too long. I have used sturdy thick glasses just so the kids could learn to load the dishwasher without breaking everthing. Now it's time for a real glasses.  These are a work of art. Nice to look at and to hold. They did break the first time I ordered them, I think they were over packed in the box, but Amazon took care of that and replaced the broken ones. The second shipment was fine I enjoy these every day. Perfect for a tall orange ice tea. 
 I am very impressed with this book and the vast topics the author had covered using human beings' physical body to explain the beauty of human beings' spirits.  If you are looking for one book to fix all your life problems or thinking this will cure your illness for sure, this book can only be a starting point for you.  Don't expect any book, anyone can fix your problems and/or illness.  Ultimately, it is up to you at the end of the day (your desire) whether you want to heal your physical and emotional body.  However, this book is a gateway and overview about what you can do to lift your spirits, if you choose to open your heart to read, listen without judgment.  Nobody says everything Caroline Myss says must be the Divine truth.  But what harm does it do to you when you just open up and see what she has to say first?  Then, you can choose what sort of a belief system you want to carry.  I will say this though, if you are looking for intuition and guidance of spirituality, it is a great overview book to help you explore.  But if you are looking for books with healing messages behind, this book might be overwhelming.  As human beings, I think we need to find our own way to heal the wounds the understanding of Forgiveness.  I find "Heart of Forgiveness: A Practical Path to Healing by Madeline Ko-I Bastis" to be extremely helpful to heal emotional wounds.    Don't get frustrated with Caroline Myss because she is trying to cover a massive amount of topics to help the readers to be awaken.  Wounds (physical and emotional) itself aren't bad but they are just signs for the awakening process.  And I understand some readers get frustrated when she mentioned about woundology.  My interpretation of her words is that wounds itself is not a problem (not good nor bad).  At any point of time, we need to process the wounds with therapists and/or with groups as well as supportive friends and family.  What she was trying to point out is that sometimes wounds can be unconsiously used as ways to control others and some people unconsiously/consiously use wounds to manipulate others just to get what they want.  It is then wounds itself becomes harmful to self and others.  It is then the group therapy, therapies in general becomes harmful for everyone's spirit.  Nobody says healing is easy (yet it is simple because it is a spiritual decision we are trying to make).  It requires us to examine even the manipulative/controlling side of self to ask the most important question ... Whether we are afraid to break away from wounds because we will be exposed to the healing world.  We are just human beings who have fears.  I think this book is wonderful to expose our fear-based thinking/feeling in light for use to examine.  I am very glad I read this book.  Wounderful way to self-explore and to learn deep about life.     
 I can't say enough good things about THE REEF! It shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men, and a strong sensitive male that isn't afraid to dream.  This is a fantasy come true and involves marine archeologist Tate Beaumont and Matthew Lassiter and their families. The families run into each other while treasure-hunting for Angelique's Curse - a treasure that has eluded everyone, and many think it is only a myth. But this artifact is worth everything to some, even worth killing another.   As this joint expedition continues, it holds all of the elements needed for a great story: mystery, romance, secrets that can't be shared, deceptions and threats. There are so many angles that could have been pursued the reader isn't sure which avenue Nora Roberts will take until she delivers them to it. This always keeps you on the edge of your seat, and gives you a first hand "view" of the undersea world of beauty and intrigue.  I highly recommend THE REEF and only wish it would have continued - or at least had a sequel in the works! Great characters and fantastic plot will hook the reader from the beginning. One of Nora Roberts better works! 
 As an ex-Schwab employee (1991-2000), I recommend the book highly.  Having firsthand knowledge of the people and many of the events that were reported in the book I found the historical portions of the book to be accurate.  John Kador has done an excellent job of capturing the history, heroic vision and ethics of Schwab (both Chuck and the company) and how the company revolutionized the discount brokerage industry and the distribution of mutual funds.  Also, I thought his comments and perspectives into the many challenges the company overcame, and current hurdles to overcome, were incredibly insightful.  John writes in a narrative style that reads more like a fiction novel than what one might expect for a "business book".  As I said, I'm an ex-employee and still found it to be a page-turner.  I couldn't wait to read what else John had accurately captured about Schwab's long history.  I have recommended the book to all of the Schwab employees and ex-employees I keep in touch with.    The book was written prior to the most recent re-emergence of Chuck Schwab as sole CEO of the company, so much has changed since the book was finished, but I still believe it is a great read for anyone who is interested in the history of one of the few revolutionary Fortune 500 companies.  This one is worth buying.  You won't regret it 
 The unpredictability and complexity of human behavior have always made the discipline of Political Science more of an art than a science. This book does not change this statement, but it does offer a simple, but elegant framework for interpreting the fate of nation states. Ian Bremmer suggests that a simple graph in which the y-axis (vertical) represents levels of stable governance and the x-axis (horizontal) represents degrees of openness to out side influences can be used to classify and compare all of the nation states of the world. He also postulates that if all nation states are plotted onto the graph they will describe a "J" shaped curve. Bremmer then backs his claim up with specific examples of countries which he believes illustrate his argument. He does a good job and has convinced, at least this reviewer, that he has developed a very useful tool for commercial risk management and for government policy makers.    Bremmer makes abundantly clear that stable governance is not in itself a good thing, but simply that the governing persons or institutions have remained unchanged for a period of time. In the same way, he sees `openness' that is the willingness of a country to embrace globalization including international trade and communications as a mixed blessing in that outside influences in some countries could produce high levels of  political instability. In the course of doing case studies to support his concept, Bremmer provides some particularly insightful thoughts on Russia and China which demonstrate he has indeed thought about this concept very carefully.  The "J" curve graph is undoubtedly a useful tool especially for determining the levels and kinds of risks involved in international capital investment, joint ventures, and overseas manufacturing. It is also one of the tools that the makers of foreign policy should apply to their arcane business. Still this book is a long way from being the definitive concept for understanding the incredibly complex and dynamic phenomenon of Globalization. It is one more piece, all be it an important piece, in a really hard jigsaw puzzle. 
 Waugh had a sure grasp of the language, which makes this novel a pleasure to read. He was a natural writer, and a natural stylist. This particular novel is a satire, although a subtle, understated one. Even though Waugh never really comes out and says it, he thinks WWII might have been an unnecessary war. Parts of this book are obviously autobiographical. Some parts are hilarious, especially the "thunder-box" and all the machinations surrounding it, and the fierce and terrifying Ritchie-Hooks, who's missing an eye and some fingers, and who has a penchant for shrunken heads. Don't expect any big yucks. But if you like quiet satire, take a look at it 
 Jonathan D. Spence has accomplished a lot in this remarkable biography of the second emperor of the last Chinese imperial dynasty Qing, K'and-Hsi, for the general audience.  Based on the writing of the emperor, court records and later secondary sources, book follows the emperor through his struggles with opposition, Manchurian and Han nobility, his troubled relationships with his numerous sons, his old age, and his legacy. Remarkable in its vividness is last few chapters, where the emperor legacy is laid out based on the official court-issued papers, and the informal drafts of the will. I would like to see more description of court ceremony; and perhaps a more thorough reflection on the Manchu / Han opposition; but those subjects are well covered in the other book by the same author (e.g. "The Search for Modern China"). Great starting point for anybody interested in Chinese history 
 This was such a great book, it's one of my favorites!  She's such a good auther.  The sequel is really good as well(something blue), however this book was sooooooooo good!!!  I just bought Baby Proof and can't wait to read it 
 NO ONE BOOK CAN CONTAIN THE SUM TOTAL OF KNOWLEDGE ON A PARTICULAR SUBJECT BUT THIS ONE COMES CLOSE.  FROM IP6 TO ACCUPUNCTURE, TO HERBAL REMEDIES, IT COVERS IT ALL.  WRITTEN IN CONCISE EASY TO UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE IT IS A TREMENDOUS RESOURSE, FOR THE PET OWNER CONCERNED WITH THE OVERMEDICATION OF HIS OR HER PETS.  ALTERNATIVES TO WESTERN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE CAN BE AS VALID FOR OUR PETS, AS THEY CAN BE FOR OURSELVES.  THE WRITER USES A VERY REASONED COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO PET HEALTH CARE.  I, FOR ONE, AM LOOKING FOR THE AUTHOR'S SECOND & FOLLOWUP BOOK ON THE SUBJECT 
 With the tragedy of Katrina, Stanton Moore faced many challenges and hardships both personally and profesionally.  He's a survivor.  Instead of succumbing to these obstacles, Stanton decides to rent out Preservation Hall record this amazing third disc.  The opening track, Poison Pushy is Stanton and the New Orleans funk sound at its best.  Dynamic, rhythmic and passionate, simply put, this music has soul.  I have been a Stanton Moore fan for a while now and despite the recent setbacks, he just keeps getting better and better.  Robert Walter and Will Bernard are magnificent and the cover of Led Zep's When the Levee Breaks is both sad and dramatic.  It is performed with class.  If you are a Stanton fan you won't be disappointed and if you are new to the New Orleans sound you'll have a nice taste of Stanton Moore's amazing talents 
 This is one of those books, once you start reading you can't stop.  I can't even describe the horror and atrocity the Cambodian people had to endure under the Khmer Rouge, but Molyda's book is heart breaking because  the story is told from the child's viewpoint.  This is a wonderful book  describing an event that should never have happened.  Hopefully after  reading this book, people will never let genocide and a holocaust exist  ever again on this earth 
 As a long-time fan of Access Guides and of the city of Chicago, I was pleased to find this pocket guide to Chicago architecture.  Loved the history and all the visual detail "explained" that made it easy for me to visit and observe.  This is a "must-have" for visitors  and architecture buffs as well.  It spurred me on to pick up the  "skyline Chicago" videos.  As well done as any Ken Burns  documentary, these are great -- loved Chicago's Neighborhoods in  particular 
 I have read or listened to everyone one of the alphabet series and always look forward to the next one.  I travel a lot and these tapes have brought me a lot of entertainment on the road.  Judy Kaye has an amazing voice 
 Usually I am quite skeptical when it comes to the types of books that claim to "teach you something in 24 hours". SAMS Publishing hired a guru-like author to write this book. Kynn Bartlett is a participant in the W3C technical working group (http://www.w3c.org) and the infamous HTML Writers Guild.  "Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours", starts off with the basics of CSS scripting. The book discusses what Cascading Style Sheets are, how they are supported among the different browsers (and platforms) and how they are used with HTML.  Part I is a general introduction to CSS. Part II begins by explaining the CSS Box Model and inheriting properties of CSS classes ("The Core Principles of CSS"). Part III continues with styling text, backgrounds, lists, tables and general page layout and webdesign using Cascading Style Sheets.  Once you have completed Part III, you have spent a total of 18 hours learning CSS. That sounds like learning at the speed of light, but trust me with this book, it's very possible.  Having only six hours left to master CSS you continue with Part IV, which covers CSS and printing, Internationalization, user interface, CSS and JavaScript and last but not least, CSS and XML.  The speed the author proposes that you learn and comprehend is reasonable. CSS is not a killer to learn, unlike a real programming language - such as C++ or Java. And remember, although the title states that the book will teach you CSS in 24 hours, it does not mean, that you take the 24 hour tour non-stop.  Reading each chapter I really began to like Bartlett's style. Every item in the book is explained in brief but also has nice depth, always very straight forward and clear. I especially liked how the author added little boxes to each chaper that tell you workarounds, browser specific issues or how to debug your code - if what you learned so far doesn't work.  Last but not least, the book features Part V - the apendix. The apendix covers "How to Read W3C Recommendations", "Replacing Presentational HTML with CSS" and the "Glossary".  	 Since I knew almost all the CSS techniques that Bartlett talked about in the preceeding chapters, "Replacing Presentational HTML with CSS" became my favorite and it's probably the chapter all you codewarriors out there will love. It features a table that shows the HTML tag and the equivalent in CSS, so all that is left to do is to run "search'n'replace" with your favorite editor across your HTML files and violá - done!  As the name suggests "Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours" is a book for the beginner, not for intermediate and by far not for the advanced. Kynn Bartlett talks about everything you need to know about writing Cascading Style Sheets. You do not have to be a computer junkie or freak to understand what he is telling you.  If you worked with CSS before and if you are quite comfortable with it, you might look elsewhere for a more advanced CSS reference book 
 Yeah! This book rocked! Get this book! Go Documentary Institute! ;) Yeah 
 This is a wonderful book, but did you know there's a revised 2004 edition available? Click on "Paperback (2nd)" so you can get the most updated information on this subject 
 Easy to read and well-researched, this is an excellent book to add to your layperson's repertoire on Ukrainian/Russian Jewish history.  I learned a lot about how Jewish people lived, what they did, what they thought  about... and how political events shaped their lives 
 its a nice book it will help find our camp sites going acrose country Thank 
 In this book we see games we have played many times, and have (maybe) become bored with, revitalized with clever ideas, enhancements and suggestions from the author. As an example, consider the section on balancing non-symmetric games (such as Chess and Go which have an inbuilt first person advantage). Bidding, simultaneous playing of two games and the ingeneous "I'll make a move and then you decide whether to play black or white" idea where one player makes a move that the other player has to decide is bad or good are suggestions that are useful not just in the context given, but in the design and evaluation of all games. Recommended for anyone who enjoys, studies, reviews or designs games -- especially strategy games 
 This book was so much fun to read to my children.  My daughter loved it so much I had to read it to her all the time.  When she was old enough to read, she memorized the WHOLE book.  She could stand and recite it from beginning to end and act it out for her little brother who thought she was just the best big sister.  Now that is a powerful testimony as to how much they enjoyed it.  She is now 27 and still remembers the whole book. I'm sure your children will enjoy it as much as mine did. Kare 
 the is an amazing and touching story!!! i reccomend it to everyone!!! 
 My first time in Africa and trekking up Kili!! And everything I needed to know was in this great book. If you are planning to climb Kili, do not hesitate and get this book 
 This is a superb book. It is full of information for anyone who wants to start to look into prophecy and it is also great for those who are already into prophecy study. This is one book to have in your library as NOW is the time to LOOK UP to Jesus' soon return. Hope anyone remotely interested will purchase this great book.. get out your Bibles as this book continously refers to God's word! GREAT!! 
 Here we have Kurt Vonnegut interviewing dead people with the help of Dr. Kevorkian. Among those who are interviewed are Adolf Hiter, James Earl Ray, and Kilgore Trout. These short interviews range from humorous to thought-provoking (and everything in between). This book, if you haven't already noticed, is very short and is easily read in one sit. For those who are Vonnegut fans, I highly recommend buying this book- it is a very enjoyable read. If you're new to Vonnegut, I would recommend something different such as Slaughter House Five, Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions, or, my personal favorite, Slapstick 
 Fans of producer/director Harold Price, who was a giant in musical theatre circles, will relish an expanded edition of the classic coverage which even includes an updated foreword by Prince himself. Prince's works are wide-ranging, from his direction of Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Evita" to his productions of "Fiddler on the Roof" and "West Side Story". Various chapters cover Prince's more recent work as well, adding insights and numerous rare photos which make Harold Pricne And The American Musical Theatre a 'must' for discriminating audiences. 
 This is a great read. I've had this book for a few years and I'm always referring back to it from 
 The Czech recordings on this album provide a look back on a regional culture which is rapidly disappearing in Texas, that of Bohemian and Moravian Texas.  While listening to these recordings, you may find your  mind drifting back 50 years to a rural Texas dance hall.  The smell of  cotton fields mixes with the smell of cold beer and kolaches, while happy  people dance to a beautiful Adolf Hofner waltz.   You can feel the history  in these recordings 
 I own several Indian cookbooks and I find this one to be the most wonderful and uncompromisingly authentic, as far as my ability to judge is not as a native eater but as a self taught fan of southern Indian food.  It must be said that though the recipes are elaborate, they are certainly not difficult.  Though the preparation time is sometimes hours or days, much of that time is soaking dried beans.  Though the ingredient list is often a mile long, a trip or two to the Indian grocery is all that's necessary to lay in the staples.  Read the recipe thoroughly first and make a cooking plan and you can't go wrong.  I agree with some of the other reviewers here about spice levels.  You can easily cut the recipe chili pepper quantities in half, quarter, or even less, and still have flaming hot spicy dish.  I imagine that this book could do a better job of clarification about chili peppers in general.  I'd read somewhere in another book that green chilis are always used fresh and red chilis are always used dried.  "Chilis" is the extent of the description in this book, and it's up to you to provide dried or fresh of any number of peppers; That can make a big difference in spice levels 
 I adore this film, I adored the music even more.  The one missing song in this soundtrack was "Atrevido" by Orishas, the song that's played when Syd and Tapia are at the beach for a meeting 
 I BOUGHT THIS BOOK IN ST CROIX,IT WAS VERY GOOD.IT S ABOUT BILLY THE KID 
 What I want with each retelling, whether it be a nursery rhyme or one of my grandfather's war stories, is something fresh and different. I love, of course, rereading my favorite books and poems, but with a tale like that of Orpheus and Eurydice, I'm simply not looking for the same story. I want a new perspective, not only a retelling, but a reshaping of the myth. Orr puts his own spirit into what many of you may know of as the tragic lives of the two lovers. He writes, however, from a place unlike most before him. With the same joy as seeing a film remade with exceptional talent, I read Orr's work with excitement and pleasure. It's not the same story. It's much more 
 I found MF Doom by way of Gorillaz.  From there, I moved on to The Mouse and the Mask.  Then, I kind of stopped, on account of his schizophrenic cast of monickers.  Eventually, I decided to go to the extended efforts required to pick up this record.  I'm glad I did.  This CD is, in every way, an appropriate companion to The Mouse and the Mask.  Doom's flow is conversational and complex, there are very few hook-verse-hook structures on the record, most of the tracks clock in at around two minutes--it's typical Doom (or typical new Doom, if you're in the same school as some of the other reviewers).  I like that.  If you like it, you'll like this.  Simple decision.  If you're not so familiar with Doom and looking at this as a first record, that's certainly a decent idea in theory.  The fact that you can't find it for less than $50 these days (thanks, Stan Lee) is a bit of a deterrent, but if you can get your hands on it, by all means, this is one of the more user-friendly introductions to MF Doom you can find (Madvillain, while impressive in its own way, REALLY comes off as only so much disjointed noise the first couple of times through--this record, on the other hand, at least splits into discernible tracks).  From a purely budgetary perspective, though, I'd have to recommend The Mouse and the Mask as a more affordable starter if you haven't hit it already.  If you're already a Doom fan, you probably have this already and I'm not entirely sure why you're reading this.  I will say that I don't find much fault with either the production or the skit interlude (which is pretty catchy, in my opinion, and basically just acts like a long instrumental track in the right spot on the album).  Dedicated fans need feel no trepidation.  Folks who are only familiar with Operation:  Doomsday, however, should be aware that this is a very different album.  Superior, as far as I'm concerned, but different for sure.  The creative production is still there, but the structure on each track is a lot less mundane than what you find on his first album (under this name, anyway).  If you're expecting typical verse-chorus-verse, you might be disappointed 
 Sarah Breathnach writes about the simple pleasures in life in such a way that it makes you want to try all the wonderful small joys she speaks about in the book. Even my husband picks it up and reads the daily messages. He comes out with a smile on his face with some kind of comment on the subject matter each day! 
 John Steinbeck has written a novel with a powerful message; sometimes, things are best just the way they are.  The story, based on a Mexican folk tale, centers on Kino, Juana, and their baby son Coyotito.  Kino is a poor fisherman/pearl diver, relying on his canoe which was passed on from his grandfather down to him.  His family lives in a small grass shack and they have very few possessions, but they have each other and they are happy.  However, one day, baby Coyotito is bitten by a scorpion which made its way into his crib.  Immediately, the poison begins to take hold, despite Juana's frantic efforts to suck the poison out of the baby.  Desperate for their baby, Kino and Juana take him into town to see the doctor.  However, once in town, they are informed that the doctor is out on another visit, when in reality, he doesn't want to see Kino's family at all. Disheartened, Kino heads for his canoe.  Once out on the water, he goes through his regular routine of gathering clams and searching for pearls.  But this dive turns out to be like no other Kini has ever experienced, for when he opens one of the clams, he sees the biggest pearl he's ever seen; The Pearl of the World.  It is as large as a seagull's egg, and as perfect as the moon.  Kino sees the immediate end to all of his problems, for with this pearl, he will have wealth beyond his wildest dreams: or will he?  Almost immediately, things begin to change in Kino's life.  He begins to watch people a little more closely, fearing that they may try to steal his pearl.  He dreams of owning new clothes, a new rifle, and having his son attend school someday.  He decides to venture into town to sell the pearl and collect his fortune.  But, what he finds out there is not what he expected.  The buyers tell him that the pearl is too large and because it is so large, it is not worth much money.  He is offered much less money than he expected.  Enraged, Kino and Juana head back to their house, and he buries the pearl in the dirt floor.  But, during the night, someone sets his house on fire.  Everything is quickly consumed, leaving only a few items.  Kino then goes to check on his canoe, but he finds that someone has punched a hole in the bottom, rendering it useless.  Determined to get what he thinks the pearl is worth, the family decides to head to the capitol and sell the pearl there.  But, Kino soon realizes that they are not alone; three trackers are following them.  Kino tries to stay ahead of the trackers as they head off into the mountains.  Will Kino succeed in selling his treasured pearl, or will the trackers catch up to them?  This is an excellent book, and it carries an important message; sometimes, things are better off the way they are rather than changing them.  Kino was a humble and hard-working young man trying to raise his family the best he could, but once he found the pearl, everything about him changed.  He became suspicious, greedy, and disrespectful to Juana.  Granted, his intentions were good, but his actions were not.  In the end, Kino ends up losing two precious things.  I highly recommend this classic work by John Steinbeck.  Its message is clear; sometimes, things are best just the way they are.     
 If you want to know how to improve your times, surely this book will help. Bob Glover has an enormous experience about running and has written it in this publication. It's a book to be read several times, when you have questions, you'll find answers there.  Recomended 
 If you're into carrying little reminder cards and/or posting them around your home or office, these are excellent.  They're all taken from the information in Eker's bestseller, and are great little reminders.  Apparently the other reviewers either don't like reminder cards (which is fine), or think all cards have to be spiritually enlightening.  In my opinion, financial cards are as valid as angel cards or self-worth cards or any others.  If you learned from Eker's book and/or seminar and don't want to write his thoughts on Post-Its (as I was doing), these cards work great 
 If you need ANY information about ANY player on the NHL, whether active or retired (or even a rookie), it's ALL in there. 672 pages filled with all the statistics you need about your favorite players. This year, the book includes facts like "who played where in 2004-05" and "Who's playing where in 2005-06" (with all the changes that took place during the summer). Plus information about thye 2006 Olympics AND the New Rules. For the price, you get more than your money's worth. but just don't take my word for it, but it, read it, use it. It's also a nice cover with Lemieux (now retired, unfortunately, again) and Crosby, the next one. Highly recommended! :) 
 Any man that can write a book with a bright pink cover must be very secure in his masculinity.  Dr. Schwartz is also very secure in his knowledge of the "real" history of gambling, legalized or otherwise. Just when you think you know the truth, as it has been told for generations, here comes a maverick historian to turn your conceptions upside-down.  Seriously, does anyone have any respect for Senator McCarran before they read about his valiant battle to keep Nevada's peculiar peculiarity as peacefully peculiar as possible, without the wretched government interfering?  And would the world's FOREMOST AUTHORITY on gambling, Dr. William Eadington, make Dr. David Schwartz's book required reading for his class if it were not one of the leading texts on the subject? His book is a true delight to read, and, as it is broken up into bite-sized sections with headings such as "The Californication of the casino resort" and "Requiem for a bootlegger", you can read a few pages and then ponder or nap without the guilt associated with reading only halfway through a chapter. How's that for a review that sounds like it was poured straight from the fount of the commonfolk! Normal people DO read this kind of stuff too, so don't be afraid to crack it open! 
 A great book for leftie's of all ages. Finally someone realizes our natural greatness! :o) Many interesting facts are included here that are sure to provide hours of enjoyment. Fascinating information will stupify  those stubborn righties on why left is right!  The easy to read format is  great for lefty kids who'll also have fun dumbfounding their right-handed  counterparts who try to make fun of them. :o 
 I am not normally a big fan of Stephen King, but I greatly enjoyed this CD. The humor that is sometimes lost in his prose comes through in the expression of his voice. Many authors are not particularly adept at reading their own work, but King is wonderful. He has a nice voice. I would recommend this CD for fans of Stephen King and for people who simply enjoy being told a good story 
 I have a nephew who is having trouble with reading, so I choose a book series and we each read the book.  Then we get together and discuss the book.  If he reads it and truly comprehends it, then he gets to pick a "prize" such as a trip to the zoo or a museum, or a restaurant.  But it's hard to find books that appeal to an 11-12 year old and to his aunt!  This series is great!  It's funny, quick and smart!  And I like the fact that there are strong female characters as well!  It's good for him to see that in literature and in life 
 Although I am a fan of the highly popular book and DVD, "The Secret," I find that this little book fills in quite a few gaps for me.  Like "The Secret," this book is also about manifesting what you want in life effortlessly. But I consider myself to be a spiritual person, and this book clearly includes the concept of a divine power at work on my behalf . . . and I like that. It also, surprisingly, is a very practical book, because it focuses on the important role that action plays in the manifestation process, which is something that is almost ignored in "The Secret." All this and much more in a book that is based on a simple little children's song!  Outstanding 
 Running with the Bulls is autobiography par excellence.  Valerie Hemingway openly and frankly tells the fascinating story of her life, which began as Valerie Danby-Smith.  Her mother was English Catholic, her father Irish Protestant, and their marriage failed.  Young Valerie grew up in a convent in Ireland, literally, and she spent the summers of her youth, when the convent school was closed, at a country hotel that attracted artists and writers.   Aspiring to be a journalist, young Danby-Smith went to Spain.  There she went to interview the American author Ernest Hemingway, then 59 years old and enthusiastically visiting sites from his earlier days.  Thus the 19-year-old Irish woman began figuratively "running with the bulls."    Danby-Smith became Hemingway's secretary and confidant.  She traveled in Spain and France with the Hemingway entourage.  She moved to Cuba to help the writer, but soon the Cuban Revolution forced the Hemingways to leave Cuba.  Danby-Smith went to New York City to pursue her career, and the Hemingways moved to Idaho.  There Ernest Hemingway committed suicide.  At his funeral Danby-Smith met Hemingway's youngest son, Gregory, long estranged from the family for reasons she did not learn until many years later.  With Fidel Castro's complacency, she helped Hemingway's widow smuggle the famous author's manuscripts and art collection out of Cuba.  For several years thereafter she sorted the Hemingway papers at the office of his publisher in New York City.  When she married Gregory Hemingway, he was a young doctor in New York.  The marriage took her to Florida, back to New York, and later to Montana, where the tragic drama of Gregory's life eventually brought the marriage to an end.  Nothing in this book is expected.  If the book were a novel, the reader would not believe the story, the famous characters, the twists and turns.  But the story is true, and Valerie Hemingway lived it.  She tells her story with grace, discretion, and the skill of a fine journalist whose early mentor had been the legendary Ernest Hemingway.    At the time she was hired, Ernest Hemingway had stipulated that a requirement of employment was that she would not write about the family.  She honored that requirement. But years have passed and others have written about her relationship with Ernest Hemingway, so the time came for Valerie Hemingway to tell it like it was.  It was an adventure 
 This book is great.  You feel like you are there with him while he does all that happens in this book.  I don't want to say to much and give away the plot but this book had me hooked from page one 
 In my opinion this was definitely O.K.'s crowning moment which makes it even more frustrating that this was their last outing as a duo. Where as their debut was more intellectual+their 2nd album was dark, deep and sinister, this is their most straight forward, no nonsense, battle orientated hiphop album. Laced with the hardest+funkiest beats in their entire catalogue and blessed with top notch airtight party jams+battle rhymes this is a true b-boy's dream. With production handled by DIAMOND D, BUCKWILD, SHOWBIZ and ROCKWILDER aswell as O.K. themselves all the tracks are blazing!!! These 2 mc's were never really giving the backing their very obvious talent deserved (just like ARTIFACTS around the same time) so the inevitable happened and they split up shortly after this, their 3rd album. Its a shame 'cuz with anthems such as "soundman", "move!" "questions", "numbers" and the perfect "somehow, someway" aswell as high charged battle tracks like "confrontations", "sin", "hate" and "chuck cheese" added to the melodic "invetro" and "shugah shorty" the album really is tight from start to finish. Dope album, no question! 
 I'd like to ardently thank "A Reader from New York" for giving away the last line of this book, which I bought shorty before reading your review. That was very, very considerate of you 
 It seems like the reviews of "The Catcher in the Rye" are fairly polarized.  Some people identify strongly with Holden Caulfield, while others tend to think he is spoiled or annoying.  I think there are good reasons to feel either way about him.  For me, though, Holden Caulfield is one of the most likeable characters I've ever encountered, and it's probably because he's so honest. He tells you everything he's thinking, whether it's embarrassing or not. Most of the time what he's thinking is either hilarious or depressing; often it's both at the same time. But every now and then he also explores deeper emotional territory...like the loss of a loved one, or the fleeting nature of youth and innocence.  In fact, although people view the book in different ways, for me "The Catcher in the Rye" is not the story of a rebellious malcontent. Instead, I see Holden as a sensitive young man who is struggling to deal with the death of his brother...while at the same time making the confusing transition between childhood and adulthood. Although on the surface we see Holden going around calling a lot of stuff phony, underneath his defensive exterior he literally aches to connect with other people, and he treasures the few moments when real connection becomes possible. To enjoy this book, then, you've just got to remember that Holden Caulfield has a heart of gold...it's just that he's also in a lot of pain. And like everyone else, he's not perfect. Great book 
 good stuff. does what its supposed to. a lot of sweat produced when treadmilling with it. 
 This exceptionall well written, hilarious travel book should be in every travelers Christmas stocking, male or female.  It makes you want to take off on adventuresome journeys, rids you of mundane travel plans, and gives you the heart to try new adventures daily 
 I love this book. It offers an extensive history of the Italian American experience. This book is used as the textbook for a course I took, and I found myself consumed by it. Something I really appreciate about how this book is written is that while it is about Italian-Americans, it is also about what they left behind in Italy, and why. The context provided is concise, but very informative. Topics covered in La Storia include the Risorgimento, conditions emigrants endured, anti-Italian discrimination, westward expansion in the U.S., the mafia, anarchism (Sacco & Vanzetti), the image of the Italian-American, hollywood, and politics.  This is a great read (albeit a long one), and I highly recommend it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that this book is mostly for those of Southern Italian and Sicilian extraction. Those who originate from Northern Italy may feel excluded 
 This is an astounding work.  Viola speaks to the church with a broken heart.  It is heavily endowed with rich biblical and supplemental scholarship.  His presentation is not wooden theology but life-giving substance for those seeking a greater experience with Christ in a corporate NT church setting.  He argues that a paradigm shift ought to occur in the church if real fruit will be produced in the lives of believers.  Viola also warns against house movements that have simply become glorified bible studies, bless me clubs, special interest groups and so on.  As with any good Christian writer he points the believer to Christ and not himself.  After reading this book you feel liberated to seek more of God!  Get this book and be changed in a deep and permanent way.  It is a tremendous tribute and asset to the kingdom of God. 
 The Annunciation is an intriguing book, a tale of the universal search for meaning and spirituality in a materialistic world. Before starting, I expected the plot to be somewhat farfetched, but having worked with young teens for a long time, I can see that something like this could happen. Each of the major characters lacks something important in his/her life, and it takes a tragedy for them each to learn that their resolutions lie not in miracles but in themselves and in each other. The truth of the central mystery remains hidden till the novel's end, and even then, not all questions are answered or problems solved. Thought provoking and skillfully crafted 
 "Bunny on the Move" by Peter McCarty is an unforgettable picture book depicting a bunny who moves from page to page, past a variety of animals to get back to his family.  The bunny is not lost.  He knows he  must get home, and although a pig, cow, and sheep, and even a friendly  little girl try to divert his attention, he is a bunny with a mission.   "This bunny would not look back. This bunny had come a long way."  The last page tells us "this bunny did have a home, This bunny did  have a place to stay."  The illustrations are reminiscent of a dream.   The colors used are gray and white, with tinges of yellow and pink.  The  bunny and animal shapes are soft and powdery, the light source seems to  illuminate the foreground images.  This text is very simple, adding even  more emphasis to the unusual and unique depictions.  This is an excellent  bedtime choice for children 2-8 years of age, and merits the top of my list  for quality picturebooks of 1999 
 In 1993, at the Cannes Film Festival, "Farewell My Concubine", directed by Chen Kaige became the first mainland Chinese film to win the Palm D'or.  And after watching this masterpiece, I can understand why and can't think of a more deserving film to have such a title.  The film is a depressing and heartbreaking journey, chornicling the struggles of two peking opera performers and the woman that seemingly changes their lives and their relationship forever.  However, the film also speaks on many other levels, touching on issues such as the massive abuse of child performers in the peking opera as well as the issue of homosexuality that seemed to be so closely guarded during this time as well.  Additionally, the film gives an accurate account of China's history and the many political struggles that people of China had to endure through.  Watching friends become enemies due to one change in government was heartbreaking, and at times too disturbing to watch.  Yet that's what makes this a powerful film, and one that needs to be watched by everyone.  The acting in the film is dominated by the performances of three main actors and actresses: Leslie Cheung, known for his Wong Kar Wai roles in Days of Being Wild and Happy Together, which earned Wai Best Director nods at the 1997 Cannes, Gong Li, known for her recent role in Memoirs of A Geisha, and Zhang FengYi.  Now Leslie Cheung and Gong Li definitely lived up to their promise, and i was extremely impressed with their acting as well as the way they promoted their roles, especially Cheung, who had to play the role of a discreet homosexual actor, which was probably not an easy role, especially after a role as a ladies man in Days of Being Wild.  However, while Cheung and Li should be commended for their roles, FengYi was the one that stood out the most.  Granted, the film did focus more on his character than Cheung in many cases, but he demosntrated true emotion and effort in a character that was very complex.  When one sees this film, it will be quite easy to understand that his role is not an easy one, due to his up and down character which never really takes a hard stance on anything but acting troughout the movie.  The directing of the movie should also be commended as well.  This being my first Chen Kaige film i was a little spectical because it is common from reviews that he is an overrated director in many aspects of filmmaking.  However, I believe comments like those are false, because this film was extremely well-paced and not only that, but it remained intense throughout, which is the signal that a director can keep his or her audience focused throughout the whole film.  While many people may object to his style of filmmaking, Chen Kaige is a fabulous director and I look forward to his upcoming film, The Promise, coming out in theaters on May 5.  Farwell My Concubine is a history on many levels.  In some cases it is a history of China.  In other cases it is a history of the Peking Opera, studying both its good and bad aspects.  And in some cases, it is a study of homosexuality in China during the early 20th century and how safeguarded it was during this time.  Yet whatever one may think the purpose of this film is, it remains a story about friendship, and the challenges two friends went through during the most troublesome of times in Chinese history.  And in terms of that, it is one fantastic story to say the least.   It may not be the easiest movie to stomach, but "Farewell My Concubine" is a film that must be seen by every avid film fan 
 This is a CLASSIC Christmas movie that you AND your entire family are sure to love.  Check this out...  I PROMISE you that you will not be disappointed 
 Bunnymen fans all know the band broke up at the eve of this album.  They also know that it is an album that the band personally hated.  3 years in the making, the album was a slickly-produced affair that felt like a very smooth/commercialized version of E&B.    There's no doubt that this album lacks the originality or urgency of the band's first few albums.  There are no classics like "The Killing Moon" or "Ocean Rain" on this album.  But songs like "The Game", "Lips Like Sugar", and "Over You" still capture some of the magic of the Bunnymen.  Though it's a bit too slickly produced for me, the songs still have great lyrics and catchy melodies.  My favorite song though, is still "Bedbugs and Ballyhoo" - which I think is the only song that the band actually 'feels' like the old/not jaded Echo and the Bunnymen.  There, we hear the band having fun, which was when they were always at their best.    If you are a collector or fan, you probably already have this album already.  If you are a first time fan, try the Ocean Rain album first, and then buy this album as evidence of the band's evolution (and the swan song of the true original foursome) 
 Cars is the name of a movie to be released by Disney/Pixar in June 2006. For some reason, a series of books have been available for purchase since April. This means that the little ones (and their parents!) will know the end of the story before they see the movie should they read a book like Driving Buddies before the release date.  Featuring colorful illustrations from Disney's Storybook Artists, Driving Buddies gives an overview of the entire movie (including, unfortunately, the ending) rather than focusing on just one section of time (like many children's books based on movies).   At 32 pages, this book focuses mostly on the relationship of McQueen, the snazzy, cocky red sports car that came zipping through town, and the rusty tow truck named Mater. Without giving away the plot of the story, McQueen learns valuable lessons about "winning" and friendship.  Driving Buddies is a Step 2 book in the Step Into Reading series by Random House. Step 2 books feature large words and simple sentences, and is geared towards beginner readers (Preschool-Grade 1) who recognize familiar words on sight--but can sound out new words with help.   My son requests this book often as a bedtime story, as well as a chapter book based on the Cars movie (we do a chapter a night). If your child loves cars and colorful books, Driving Buddies is a great read 
 It's a very colorful book, full of information and ilustrations. I am argentinian and I understand it all perfectly. Very recomendable 
 A wonderful opportunity to hear men talk about their experiences, and a chance for women to think about how they objectify men (we all know how it works the other way around!).  Written clearly and with wit, by Cindi Gentry, this book is informative, juicy, without being sensationalistic.  
 Naruto is great! I wanted an anime book ever since I saw the first episode on Cartoon Network. I mainly connect with Naruto a.k.a the Nine-Tailed Fox because I don't have that many friends and I want to do my best at everything 
 It seems that the best criticism the leftists can make of Michael Savage, is some obscure reference to an alledged past life-style, as a "hippie-herbalist". Then we have the all too predictable hysterical accusations of being "racist" or "homophobic" or "bigoted". In reference to the first criticism, most people can claim to have done foolish or ridiculous things in their youth, but the trumped-up and feeble attempts to discredit Mr. Savage in regard to his "past", are merely pathetic and actually quite insignificant. In fact, how does living as an herbalist have anything to do with his current message? I don't care if he was formerly a spokesman for the ACLU or PETA. The important fact is what he has to say NOW!  As for the perpetual accusations of "bigotry", "intolerance", or "racism", this is simply how liberals attempt to "control" you. No one wants to be publicly labeled in this manner. In fact, for the past 40 years or so, most conscientious white people are absolutely terrified of the "stigma" of someone percieving them as "racist". This is how they get you to "shut-up", so to speak. Finally, we have the lame issue over Mr. Savage's "anger". SO WE FINALLY HAVE A PASSIONATE VOICE ADMONISHING US TO SAVE OUR COUNTRY! ITS ABOUT TIME! Its time to face the facts: We are being sold out. American citizens, are now seeing their nation sold out from under them. Our very national soveriegnty is at grave risk. Our unique national identity is being systematically undermined and ultimately dismantled. If you want to see the end-result of all this, visit any Indian Reservation. This is precisely what was done unto them, by greedy bureaucrats in a more ignorant time. Dismantling a culture, a society, is a grave atrocity...with devastating results. Such results often lead to an irreversible decline. This is already well underway in other Western nations, that is, all of Western Europe. It is stil too early to tell if Western culture will simply comply with this process like so many sheep.  Its a massive multi-faceted attack on our institutions, and many willing participants in this process have no understanding of what they are actually doing, they haven't a clue as to what they are really involved in. Some know full well what they are doing. THESE ARE THE ENEMY WITHIN!  1. In this book, Mr. Savage describes who these various elements are, and what exactly they are doing. Of course, most of these miscelleneous entities will deny any accusations of malicious activity, but to the rational observer, it is all too obvious. Mr. Savage clarifies this. 2. These observations can be verified from numerous sources, but the critical factor, is that...THE AMERICAN CITIZEN SIMPLY MUST WAKE UP AND TAKE ACTION. We have a uniquely free nation, WE MUST DEFEND IT! AMERICA IS WORTH PRESERVING! We simply must defend our BORDERS, LANGUAGE, and CULTURE! 
 A welcome reissue of one of the great bluegrass instrumental albums of all time... This 1976 classic features the venerable fiddler Kenny Baker, a longtime pal of Bill Monroe's, backed up by a small set of superpickers able to follow his lead on these ingenious tunes. Baker's sense of melody and sweetness as saws around the beats on these tunes is really remarkable -- few fiddlers can sound so old-fashioned and yet so fluid and inventive at the same time. This is some real pretty playing... Highly recommended 
 I am a novice traveller, but yet a lover of history.  I purchased 4 books in these series to each place.  Great read both on the plane ride AND while I am there.  Does it have everything....no.  But, it is easy to carry and gives you a good frame to work with. 
 The Complete Idiot's Guide to Solar Power for your home is a very good start for people who have started to think about using solar energy for their homes. If you don't know much about the subject of solar energy this book will help you get started  
 Even though this book could stand on it's own, I would have been disappointed if I hadn't read 'A Child Called It' and 'Lost Boy' first...it would have been like reading the last page of a novel first. Dave has found the capacity to forgive those that committed those horrible acts of abuse against him.  That takes a great man to do that.  After I started the book, I kept turning the pages hoping to see that he had taken a gun and shot that 'thing' that called herself Mother.  But, Dave was bigger that and everyone, whether they were ever abused or not, could learn a lot from Dave Pelzer.  God Bless you, Dave 
 Those who did not like this book must not have read any of Paula Fox's other books.  Her sparse, unsentimental style may not appeal to anyone, but to those who know and love her writing, of which there are many, this book is representative of her work and highly recommended.  Many of the vignettes are profoundly moving 
 Every page has color pictures on it. The bulk of the book describes each variety of hydrangea. There's a little info on planting 
 i havent been listenin to mf doom a long time, only a couple years. when i first heard him i was like damn this is what hip hops missin. feelin his flow, lyrics, beats. it reminds me of the golden age of hip hop. ive got to the point where i just pick up his cd without even hearing a track. only thing i didnt like about this cd was that its one long track (same thing everybody else said). its annoying because i have to fast-forward (like a tape) to get to certain songs i wanna hear. even though i love the cd and will listen all the way through, its just sometimes i wanna hear a song in particular. the audio is amazingly clear. when i first heard he had another cd coming out i thought it was all new songs, the fact it wasnt was a let down, but cause the songs is classic i didnt care! pick this up! 4.5 stars 
 This movie is wonderful.  Anyone who collects DVDs must have this film in their collection.  It was 100% real.  I love every scene and every character.  I am glad this movie was made 
 Ray Zardetto's parody of Mitch Albom's beautuiful book is a clever romp through what life must be like growing up on the Jersey shore and working at one of the famed Ma Bell spinoffs. It is well conceived and witty in places, though much of the humor is slapstick. What really shines in the book is his character development; all of his 'jerks' seem real, especially his ex-boss, a clueless New Jersey technology executive. While the book is nowhere near as inspirational or thought provoking as Albom's book, it is entertaining, and the plot twist at the end will have readers (especially men) reevaluating some of their relationships. Definitely worth a read 
 This was a great book because it's about a kid and a dragon. In this book a kid named Elmer finds an alley cat. The alley cat tells Elmer about a baby dragon on Wild Island. Elmer goes to Wild Island. Alot of animals that try to eat him but he saves the dragon and they fly away. This is a great book 
 The French Revolution is an excellent documentary on the History Channel which is well acted and very enlightening. The reenactments were superb with good paintings, authentic customes and illustrations of this period of ernomous upheaval in France as well as Europe. The commentaries by a selection of historians were very well done.  The documentary vividly brought to light the chaotic scenes during the dramatic and far reaching events of the Revolution complete with the mindless violence and bloodletting in the Reign of Terror. The heavy fighting by the French Forces during this period against the various coalitions that were determined to crash the Revolution added to the misery and suffering of the French people. I loved and was moved by the dignity and bravery with which King Louis and his wife, Antoinette faced their fate at the guillotine.  The narrator, Edward Herrmann, did a commendable job of taking us through this well made documentary with enthusiasm and eloquence which made the film both entertaining and enlightening 
 The authors did such a great job of creating a truly compelling multimedia piece that one doesn't just read, but experiences! The people are fascinating, the stories are inspiring, and the intriguing photos, creative graphic design and layout really works to enhance the experience. The authors even add helpful and interesting tidbits of information that help give the whole work social-historical perspective. And the CD is a work of art in itself! I couldn't put the book down, couldn't wait to meet the next person and hear their story. Such a great work 
 I would have liked to have purchased a real heirloom version of the Night Before Christmas.  This book is good value for the money paid.  There could have been more coloured pictures and the binding could have been of a more exquisite quality.  But as I already said, still good value for money. A lovely keepsake of a wonderful time in a childs life 
 I checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case. What I received is what I expected. Lots of compartments to store needed accessories, sturdy construction, pleasant appearance. As with a previous review, my only citicism is the shoulder strap. While it is comfortable when used, it is also fixed and cannot be removed. I've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane. Other than that, it was a good purchase for the price 
 The storyline- Ben's crisis - is a very useful means of conveying the message - how we show up at work is how we show up at home.  This reinforces the  mindset that we are the same person wherever we are - albeit circumstances may dictate variations on the theme.  The Learner vs. Judger model is remniscent with the 90's theme of open thinking vs. closed thinking....however, I see the value of choosing the words Judger and Learner.  The charts and graphs were very helpful in making this a useable process to shift thinking in ourselves, at work and at home.    I particularly focused on the questions provided regarding Great results begin with great questions. Will use this premise with my clients.  Thank you, Ms. Adams, for sharing your insight and inspiration.  Susan Bock Susan Bock Solutions Susan@SBockSOlutiona.com www.SusanBockSolutions.co 
 This book is a masterpiece of literature.  If you haven't yet read it, you must. It's like a Don Quixote story of the twentieth century, but much better 
 Amazing images of pollen spores, bats' faces, moths, diatoms, and more - drawn by the master. Ernst Haeckel's prints were a huge influence in the Art Nouveau movement, and the introduction to the book discusses that. Just absolutely brilliant - a surreal and gorgeous look at nature at every scale 
     This is the finest book of wartime aviation, or for that matter war, I've ever read.  A pilot who took great joy in flying but not in flying in war, Tom's willingness to leave the enemy alone as long as they leave him alone is an eye opener in this era when authors like Stephen Ambrose  try to elevate every person in uniform to mythological hero status.  The only thing I wonder about is whether the cynicism of the pilots was prevelent during the war or is a reflection of the disillusionment these young men felt in the years after the war 
 THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CD'S I OWN.  I PLAY IT OFTEN AND IT MAKES A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR ANY MOTHER.  IT TAKES YOU BACK TO THAT WONDERFUL PLACE WHEN YOU CUDDLED "YOUR OWN" AND IT MAKES YOU MISS THE  GRANDBABIES 
 Much of what you'll find here has been written before, but Pollan puts it together in an easy to understand, easy to read style.  A word of caution.....although this book is thought provoking, but must be taken in context with other readings and life experiences.  That said, Pollan reduces his financial plan to four steps.  They are:   1) Quit Your Job. Pollan recognizes that the vast majority of businesses don't care about their employees.  When push comes to shove, anyone that isn't vital is gone with no regrets.  Many readers already know that.  Pollan argues that since your employer is no longer your protector, you should treat the relationship as a relationship of equals.  That means doing what your employer is doing......by putting your needs first.  Give him or her an honest day's work, but think always in terms of where you're going and what skills you need to get there.  You are a free agent.  You are responsible for your professional growth, not the person in the corner office.  For some, this may mean stepping out on their own.  For others, it may mean staying on the job but approaching it differently. Whatever it means to you, recognize that when things go bad for the company, nobody's going to care about your mortgage, credit card bills and braces for the kids.  You need to make sure that you've got that covered by developing a set of skills and attitude that can't be replaced.  That's what free agents do.  2) Pay Cash - Bingo.  I stopped buying on credit years ago.  I won't even buy a car unless I can pay cash for it and have accelerated mortgage payments and will soon have paid off the house.  This is extreme behavior modification for many of us, but it is the true path to freedom in life.  The bottom line is that you should never buy anything on credit (cars included) that will be worth less next year than it was last year.  I can't say this in strong enough language.  If you don't owe anyone money, they can't control you.  If they can't control you, you can think in terms of what is truly best for you.  If you're in debt for any consumer purchases (credit cards, cars, etc) develop a plan to get out as quickly as you can.  You will be amazed at the impact it has on the rest of your life.  3) Don't Retire - Retirement is a concept from the days when everyone did physical work they hated because they had to put food on the table.  If you truly love your work, you won't want to quit.  The secret is to get out of debt so that you can quit that job that you hate and start doing what you love, even if it pays less.    4) Die Broke. This is an eye-catching statement, but what Pollan really means is, don't worry.  If you don't need to retire because you love what you do and are capable of doing it, you don't have to save for retirement.  You can only do this by having the right skill set and living below your means.  Since most of us aren't saving for retirement, we're going to be working anyway.  We might as well do what we love.  I decided years ago to take control of my life and even though I hadn't read this book, it's the system I chose to implement.   I'm not wealthy, but I look at how I live and I look at how my friends live and I wouldn't trade.  Think like a free agent, don't buy what you can't pay cash for (except a house, and pay that off as fast as possible), find work that you love and that makes a difference and you will have a better life.    Like most worthwhile things in life, it's so easy 
 Mark Isham's score for "Crash" easily rates as one of the most powerful and evocative one's committed to celluloid.  The music and the images onscreen are interlinked and that which is so powerfully rendered on screen is brilliantly imprinted in the mind by the music, which serves to underline and punctuate.  From pure electronic soundscapes to ethnic tinged vocals and whalings, Isham is triumphant at every turn.  Santaolalla's beautiful score for "Brokeback Mountain" bespoke of the heartache of that extraordinary film, but Isham's music has a co-starring role.  Awesome music for an awesome film.  I seriously doubt that the film would have impacted me as much as it did had not the score been so exceptional.  If you haven't seen the film, rent/buy it today and if you have no interest in the film but want to hear some really moving and memorable music, check out this CD.  It's incredible.  
 Another wonderful suspense filled novel by Nora Roberts.  Eve, Roarke and all the characters in the books have become friends.  I can't wait to see what is happening in their lives.  The stories of the crimes Eve solves are terrific and having the changes in their personal lives interwoven through the series is adding another wonderful element.  These books transport me to another world.  Thank you Nora for sharing your wonderful gift of story telling with the world 
 This book, explaining the symbolism of the B.O.T.A. Tarot Keys, is significant for a number of reasons.  This was one of the first works in which several Occult secrets about the Tarot-- secrets which, until then, had been closely-guarded by a handful of secret Orders and Fraternities-- were revealed to the general public for the first time.  Perhaps most importantly, this was the first book that openly published the correct Hebrew letter attributions of each Key-- publicly linking Qabala and Tarot for the first time.  Previous books on the subject had either employed blinds or blatant falsehoods to conceal the correct attributions.  Publishing these correct Hebrew letter attributions was a bold step, and although it's hard to imagine today, Case's decision to go public with this information was extremely controversial among Occultists at the time.  This book also revealed the Tarot tableau, a pattern for laying out all of the Tarot Keys which reveals certain relationships and dissimilarities between them-- relationships which might not otherwise be apparent to the casual reader.  This tableau was used by the American branch of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn when Case was Praemonstrator of that Order, and like the correct Hebrew letter attributions of each Key, it had never been openly published before.  Last, but certainly not least, this was the first published book to reveal ALMOST ALL of the Tarot attributions on the Qabalistic "Cube of Space" diagram.  Until the publication of this book, most Occultists had never even heard of the Cube of Space, had no idea what its attributions were, and couldn't have guessed about how it related to the much better-known "Tree of Life" diagram.  (To give you an idea about just how esoteric this subject really is, consider that until the mid-1990's there were almost no other books in print that even mentioned the Cube of Space!)  One of the things that I really like about this book is that it includes Paul Foster Case's only public commentary about his own "Pattern on the Trestleboard," which is sort of like a Qabalistic catechism.  Granted, Case's comments are pointedly brief, but they also place "The Pattern on the Trestleboard" firmly in the public domain, where they can be openly discussed with people who aren't members of Case's organization, Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A.).  Older editions of this work also include the B.O.T.A. method for Tarot divination-- something that many of its members would be surprised to learn about, since B.O.T.A. repeatedly emphasizes that Tarot is primarily a tool for meditation, not divination!  The truth is that Tarot works rather well in either capacity, but using the Keys for divination might distract from a beginning student's more important task of discovering his or her own "Inner Self" through meditation.  Case's method of divination is similar in many respects to various Golden Dawn and Crowleyan methods that I've seen printed elsewhere-- but with some interesting, and perhaps not insignificant, differences.  As if this weren't enough to entice the serious Occultist, however, Case's analysis of each of the twenty-two Tarot Keys is nothing short of masterly.  This is really the one area in which Paul Foster Case's book towers above almost any other book about the Tarot!  Each Key is considered in light of its imagery, the Hebrew letter to which it is assigned, that letter's attribution of the Tree of Life, that letter's mode of Intelligence from the BOOK OF FORMATION, that letter's numerological significance, the Key's astrological associations... and on and on and on.  This isn't the sort of book that can be lightly read once and then set it aside-- this is a reference work which should be consulted frequently!  The Keys themselves are lovely.  Although B.O.T.A. as an organization resisted printing colored versions of these Keys for many years (Paul Foster Case insisted that coloring your own Keys was an important step in memorizing their exact details), newer editions of this book depict each Key in full glorious color!  Even the black and white editions of this book are lovely, however, emphasizing details which might be missed in colorized versions.  Based rather closely on A.E. Waite's Tarot, the B.O.T.A. deck departs radically from Waite's designs on a few of the Keys.  If Qabala is the Key to Western Occultism, Tarot is surely the Key to Qabala!  This is one of the best available works on Tarot, and Paul Foster Case's masterly analysis of the Tarot Keys can't lead you in the wrong direction.  Highly recommended for any Tarot enthusiast!

 This is a good book. It describes in direct detail the malaise called Islam. All Muslim societies as a whole are living on borrowed time now. They always potentially were, but never so much as now, in the Post - 9/11 era, when the facade got ripped off. Their arrogant conceited attitude as to their own "superiority" is naked and severe, and their pretenses are equal to those of fully equipped and capable industrialised, technological societies - even though their ramshackle medieval societies are rural and dependent on foreign aid givers for infrastructure - being actually peopled by peasants, tribesmen and nomads. Actually they have been living on the technological dole that the industrialized / modernized countries have been stupid enough to give them. No Muslim country has so far been able to demonstrate a genuine, self-sustained industrial or scientific capability or potential in the true sense of the word and yet all are dyingly desparate to be able to achieve this!  What prevents them? Something within their very essence and character does, thankfully, from achieving this ability. I say thankfully because if this impediment didn't exist, the world would be ravaged by despotism and tyrranies that would dwarf Hitler. Muslim societies may be "owners" of vast natural resources, but without outside expertise, they wouldn't probably even know of the existence of these resources, let alone their proper procurement and exploitation. Hence, they do not have the justification to claim ownership of something they can not totally deal with and need outside help to do so. And so they are not fit for, nor deserve control over these resources. (As an example, the flashy Arabian Gulf societies of the oil bearing states exhibit their glamorous but outrightly artificial capitalist patinas, which the European and industrialized world's involvement has brought to them, because of their presence there due to oil extraction. It is not a genuine or organic characteristic indigenous to those desert societies). Such contentions are reinforced most readily by the eager, hostile and hateful attitudes of bellicose "superiority" that are the hallmark of overall Muslim social, cultural and historical attitudes in general towards modern societies and ideas. Such outpourings often assume the extremes of childish histrionics.   This isn't to say that in the present world situation, America is the angel. Very far from it. America can be said to be as criminal and diabolical as the Muslims are, if not more, because of its deliberate and greedy misuse of its vast potential to uplift and shape the course of the future of humanity. It is too late to correct that now, and America is hurtling fast towards its deserved doom. (But not at the hands of Muslims. They are not capable of it, nor would they be a worthy foe. And one devil won't replace another). One key example of American misconduct is how, at a certain time in history, the US cockily thought it could employ the Muslim virus as a weapon to become the sole world superpower so that it could gain global dominance. It succeeded in these nefarious aims and methods, but just look at the aftermath. This was the US's historical mistake that would become its fatal nemesis).   But Muslim societies are most assuredly under the death sentence of history - they are ramshackle, parasitical and dysfunctional repositories of dangerous pathologies that pose a threat to the future continuity and development of human progress and civilization as a whole. They need en masse eradication to prevent them from infecting the future with their pernicious tribal and criminal illnesses. To talk of rehabilitating them is just as ridiculous or logical as "rehabilitating" a putrid corpse. One just wishes that there was a proper leader and leading power of the world around to do this key historical and spiritual job. The devilish United States and its "western" coterie of imperialist followers certainly have no justification in claiming this role.    
 The writer's in depth examination of the "Dean of Baltimore" will endure, educate and entertain devotees of the words and life on this man for many years. Ms. Rodgers research goes way beyond what most so called writers do for most books, many of which have enjoyed best seller status. This should be on many lists...Christmas lists, best seller lists and must buy lists. 
 Some great early hits and of course a fine cd, afterall it is the Beatle 
 I loved it - plenty of action and an interesting twist on history with a strong female lead. Great reading for al 
 The cover of this book caught my attention at the library, so I just had to check it out. I must say, Bell Hooks's ideas and opinions are right on the money. She mentions issues such as black male masculinity, feminism, and racism and breaks them down very well. She's not the average traditional black feminist. She's not afraid to talk bad about white folks (like Madonna) and she's brave enough to use the word "white supremacy"; not in a militant way, but more reserved. It's easy to tell she's a liberal, but she's not restricted to traditional left-wing philosophy because of her strong Afro-centric view-points. This is a must read for all Black people, especially Black women who hardly have any intellectual role-model to look up to 
 Very informative book about the Teutuls. I am a big fan of OCC. I'm willing to pay that price. Even it's overpriced 
 In the Series of Unfortunate Events there are three regular children:   Violet, who loves to invent  Klaus, who loves to read  and Sunny who loves to bite   Violet is the oldest, Claus the middle child, Sunny is the youngest.  The Reptile Room continues where Lemony Snicket's The Bad Beginning ends. The siblings are living with their new guardian professor Montgomery. He is a reptile scientist. In a room with many different reptiles, there's a newly discovered reptile that he called a deadly, dangerous snake. But it's not really dangerous at all.   Later Montes get a new assistant and it is Count Olaf in disguise. Of course something terrible happens to Uncle Morty after that and Count Olaf again tries to kidnap the children. To find out what happens next, you'll have to read the book 
 I'm not a particularly big sports fan so I am not qualified to rate the football sequences of this film but by impression is that there is nothing wonderful about them. That's fine because they are beside the point. They are just an incidental part of the story. The real story is of the aging athletes.  Nick Nolte plays the receiver of the Dallas football team. He was great in his day and still has the talent but a life on the field has severely battered his body. He's having a hard time keeping up and, for the first time in his career, he is not a starter. That slot goes to some younger talent. He's at the age where his body and his love interest insist that he should retire. The problem is that he genuinely loves the game.  He has other problems as well. Most of the team are spoiled rotten and act little better than spoiled children. The team owner and the team coach are difficult to work for; they demand sacrifice of their players but are two faced and willing to permanently see them hurt in order to further other goals such as bringing along a newer player. Having your girlfriend catch the eye of the owner's brother is also something that tends to put a damper on either your professional career or your love life.  This was presented as a comedy and there are some light moments where the players are acting badly. They are, after all, getting paid millions to play a game. It is really about the human decisions, though. It is about making tough, personal choices and being willing to live with the consequences. It is about being willing to give up that which is important. 
 This is it, look no further: Fun House is The Stooges' manic, excessive, drug, alcohol and sex-fuelled homage to everything and anything that yer bona fide very naughty boy could ever do to have fun fun fun. Nihilistic madness, the lot of it, but not yer sophisticated New Yorker dressed in black sort of nihilism. More of yer trailer trash rebel who doesn't want to miss a minute of it.  Picture this album as the unfolding story of a weekend's rampage, beginning with the opportunistism of "Down on the Street" and ending up with the come-down of "L.A. Blues". The musical mayhem in between describes pretty candidly what he gets up to. Probably a cracking party, but one that few of us could survive intact. Some pleasures are better experienced vicariously, methinks 
 The Leadership Engine, by Noel Tichy, is devoted to describing how great leaders push and lead their corporations toward success. Using case studies and research, this book shows that leader driven organizations are more successful, rather than mere manager led. In so doing, the author shows how leader led organizations have traits that lead them towards achievement of their goals.  Leaders are so intertwined with the concept of reproducing themselves that they become known for their teaching skills as much as anything else. The author points out that former General Electric CEO, Jack Welch, would spend several days a month teaching managers. While rarely showing up on the bottom line of organizations, the development of fresh leadership and the growing ability for junior leaders to make decisions on their own without direct supervision are constantly cited as reasons for success in organizations.  Over the past generation the occupation of consultant has arisen in virtually every field. From businesses, to churches, to university athletic departments, consultants work where there were previously only outside blue or white collar outside contractors. This book makes the case that consultants exist today because people simply do not want to lead. They have chosen to make their work much more complicated that it had to be by refusing to be teachers of those underneath them. And as a result, leaders have no time to research developing trends or to look long term for their organization.  Tichy emphasises that a great leader will teach others to be great leaders, not great followers. It is much easier to gather followers around an organization; people who have a passion to just follow one person's vision for the organization. This is the recipe for failure. The right people are the center of any organization, so therefore goals must be accomplished through taught people who are willing to take smart aggressive risks within the scope of an organizations mission with a constant eye towards integrity and the leading of the hand of Providence. 
 A killer stalks a small community, and a high school student (Neve Campbell) who is facing the first anniversary of her mother's murder appears to be marked for death.  This is a very well-written, clever slasher film that takes great delight in poking fun at the genre of slasher films.  It's full of trivia and self-aware clichés as well as some genuine thrills and a well-planned surprise at the end.  The whole cast is very good, but Matthew Lillard as an obnoxious high school boy and David Arquette as a deputy sheriff stand out.  Director Wes Craven, who is responsible for some of the slasher films (most notably the first "Nightmare on Elm Street") that inspired Kevin Williamson's inventive screenplay, does the best work of his career here 
 Smiley Smile is a terrific album, and definitely should rank among the most underrated, overlooked masterpieces of the last 200 years.  Sure, it wasn't "SMiLE", but it stands alone as a great work of art with its own merits. The songs, "Heroes and Villains", "Good Vibrations", and the several rare bonus tracks make the CD well worth buying, yet the CD offers much more than that.  If you like offbeat, eclectic songs, you will love Smiley Smile. This stuff is far wackier and stranger than anything the Beatles, Pink Floyd, or anyone else was doing at the time, or really since. But the songs aren't just strange and mystifying; they're also quite beautiful and enchanting.  The vocal harmony work on Smiley Smile is among the best the group ever did. The instrumentation is sparse on some songs, and deliciously rich and intricate on others. The album is an amazing tapestry of wild sound effects, beautiful vocals, haunting instrumentation, gorgeous melodies, psychedelic clownery, and genius concepts.  I could go on and on about Smiley Smile. It's one of my personal favorite albums and I never get tired of listening to it. But Smiley Smile is only half (in volume) of what the CD offers. I don't have much to say about Wild Honey other than there are several good songs on it, and it's a solid album with a consistent sound. The production is minimal as is most of the instrumentation. Overall, it's a good album worth owning if you like the Beach Boys.  The bonus tracks on this disc are just amazing. You get to hear an alternate version of Heroes and Villains often referred to as the "Cantina" version, and some of the tracking sessions for Good Vibrations, which is really quite cool. There's also a wonderful a capella song, originally from the 4 Freshman, that the Boys do with incredible grace and remarkable beauty. "Can't Wait Too Long" is apparently a SMiLE-era outtake that was never used, but it's hard to see why; it's a great song.  Basically, if you are a Beach Boys enthusiast and really like Brian's experimental side, you must get this CD. These Capitol "two-fers" are a great value, and this one in particular is a real gem 
 ... orders to proceed from China to Turkey to escort to Britain some Turkish dragon eggs that have been purchased by the British government.  So they make the interesting, if slow, land voyage after engaging a mysterious guide.    They do meet some amusing feral dragons led by  puffed-up braggart Arkady.  Then they get to Turkey where they are imprisoned as "guests." Finally they uncover a conspiracy and make a dramatic escape with the eggs.    They manage to get to Germany where the Prussians are laboring to hold back Napoleon.  The German commander has been waiting in vain for some British aid that never appeared, and he forces them to stay and help him fight rather than deliver the eggs on to Britain.    Here the book picks up tremendously as the French switch to tactics the Germans and their dragons have never before seen.    Napoleon starts stomping the hell out of Germany, forcing huge retreats.  A lot of great military action ensues.  A good read: a bit meandering in the beginning, balanced with thrilling scenes in the second half

 My American flatmate gave me this cookbook after I continually used her copy.  I've never tried a bad recipe in this book and I've frequently been begged to pass several of the recipes on (particularly the Banana Choc Chip Bread, the Cafe Beaujolias Coffee Cake and the Chicken Quarters in Chermoula!).  Highly recommended 
 For those who go to klez-kamp and those who don't.....this is a G-R-E-A-T book for the Klez-Fa 
 Here we have intrigue, adventure, excitement and even sex thrown into the book. Details are sparse, enough to interest and not to bore.   Still, Dirk Pitt's lines are a bit too smooth and clever, the bad guy doesn't evolve enough(even though the good guys are constantly moving against him, he doesn't defend and secure his base) and the ending was quite silly.   Yet, at least the action is good enough to make you want more. 
 The best thing that I can tell about this book is that it makes you think. Of course, the different matters are simplified, but it is done in a smart way. The analogies to introduce concepts are very good, in the style of The Elegant Universe. This book is not conceived to explain Relativity, Quantum Physics or Superstrings; they are described just to introduce what spacetime could be according to our knowledge. Even if it is a best seller, I think it is a brilliant book. One important note is that I read this book before The Elegant Universe, and perhaps that is why I think that The Fabric of the Cosmos is even better than The Elegant Universe 
 I found this book/CD set to be really, really helpful in learning how to pronounce Sanskrit. I will say, though, that you do need to be seriously interested in learning the pronunciation or you'll get bored very quickly. I bought this book to help me pronounce terms I always hear in my Yoga classes, and it's been extremely helpful 
 This book has engaging photography and a lot of useful information pertaining to Halloween decorating and cooking. As with all Martha Stewart books and magazines, the pictures are colorful, vivid and enchanting. The ideas are exquisite and do not look cheap or tacky. Most of the projects consist of easy-to-find materials and can be done by most anyone. These ideas are, obviously, from Martha's magazine from years gone by. This book is even more useful if you wish to compartmentalize years worth of the magazine's Halloween ideas/recipes without having to search drastically for back-issues, which can be almost impossible to buy all of. I only wish there were even more pages in this book, as I can never use enough of this lady's decorating ideas for any holiday. I have no real complaints regardless. 
 Well, LMB did it again. She completely beguiled me!  She has created yet a third Universe, after the Vorkosigan Nexus and the World of Chalion, and it is a really plausible fantasy. She introducted the notion of "ground", a mysterious life-force that pervades everything, from humans, through mosquitoes and fireflies, down to rocks, glass bowls and shards thereof, and can be perceived by the Lakewalkers "groundsense". And this notion is very central to the plot ("ground" comes so early that mentioning it is not a spoiler). So certainly the book is a fantasy, and quite a well-constructed one. It is also romance, and a very sweet romance it is. Of course, it is not a book, just half of one. The ending is not an end, you really are left waiting for the second half. But the cutting point is well-chosen, I think I'll survive till "Legacy" comes out on July 1st. But just barely.. 
 We bought this as we have the "The 20th Century Children's Book Treasury" and thought it would be a good companion piece.  I liked the choice of poems (a nice range from classic to contemporary) and the way they were organized (by theme).  My only (minor) disppointment has been that the Poetry Treasury is so small compared to the Book Treasury (87 pages vs. 297).  One of the aspects I most appreciated about this book is that the poems included are not all "children's" but are still child-friendly.  I would recommend this book for anyone with children 
 I really loved this book.  If you're expecting the same story as in "The Wedding Date," which was loosly based on this book, don't worry.  You can enjoy both without any plot spoilers!  Elizabeth Young makes you laugh out loud as you follow a "desperate" young woman on her quest for a decent date to her sister's wedding.  There are twists and turns that all lead to belly laughs and deep sighs!  What a great story 
 When it's time to put the kids to bed I highly recommend you read this book "Bambi and the Great Prince of the Forest," a midquel to the beloved story "Bambi." The book is pretty short only being 23 pages long with large print. Because the print is large and pretty easy to read this would be an ideal book for young children to start reading. The book also has very beautiful illustrations to incorporate with the imagination.   The book takes place after Bambi's mother dies and the Great Prince is force to take care of him until winter is over; teaching him the ways of the forest. At first the Great Prince is reluctant but he opens up to him at the end. It has some laughs, action and very touching moments. You also see Bambi's old friends like Thumper, Flower, Friend Owl and his sweet heart Faline. You also see Bambi's rival Ronno who teases and picks on Bambi. After all Bambi has learned from his father he took all that and put it into use by saving his surrogate mother Mena from man.   So if you need a good book to read for your kids then this book would be perfect for you!   
 In addition to five fiction titles, Eric Maisel has written somewhere in the vicinity of twenty non-fiction books, mostly about writing, creativity, and the writing life. Having already read a dozen of his books, I came to this new volume with excitement. I wasn't disappointed.  Several authors and experts have covered the topic of writing book proposals, but none have done it in the organic, yet sensible, way Maisel does. Drawing on his experience as both author and creativity coach, he walks the reader through all parts of the process, including shaping the idea, titling the book, creating all aspects of the proposal, and understanding the agent and publisher's expectations. Particularly useful are his checklists and suggested formats for keeping track of project and proposal.  Any writer serious about creating a work of non-fiction should run-don't walk!-to your nearest book outlet, get this book, and read it from cover to cover. The few hours spent will be immensely worthwhile not just for writing the proposal, but also for devising the general (perhaps even specific) outline to follow in the actual writing of the book.  Maisel includes a tremendously helpful Appendix: a sample book proposal for what turned out to be his previous book, THE VAN GOGH BLUES, which is a mind-blowingly wonderful book. With his focus on helping authors succeed and to access their creativity in the most profitable and satisfactory ways, Maisel has made this a book no writer should miss. ~Lori L. Lake, reviewer for The Independent Gay Writer and Midwest Book Review 
 I've been at a loss for a couple of years to find something to read that really grabs me.  In fact, I usually find myself bored beyond tears with the recent spate of pulp and sloppy nonsense that gets passed off as literature by most of our contemporary, popular authors.  So lately, I've been going back and trying to catch up on the works of acclaimed authors from the 20th Century, focusing on those that I never had the time or opportunity to read before now.  This week, I stumbled upon THE DUNWICH HORROR AND OTHERS by H.P. Lovecraft and was introduced to Lovecraft's whole weird and fascinating world of "the Cthulhu Mythos".  I was familiar with some of Lovecraft's more popular short stories, mainly from their bad movie adaptations (THE DUNWICH HORROR and RE-ANIMATOR spring to mind), and I've read many times where others among my favorite authors have called him "their inspiration" or "a genius ranking with Poe, Hawthorne, and Conrad".  I knew that his mythology provided a backdrop for most everything produced by Anne Rice, Poppy Z. Brite, Caitlin Kiernan, and Neil Gaiman, to the entertaining EVIL DEAD movie trilogy, even to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and DARK SHADOWS of TV-dom.  But I'd never had a chance to read Lovecraft's work for myself until now.  I've always loved a good scare and a really creepy story.  Trouble is, they're just so damned hard to find!  And when you find one that starts out with great potential, it usually degenerates into formulaic banality and clichés by the end.  However, I now understand why Lovecraft is so admired.  While his writing style is clearly dated, his stories are downright frightening.  It's awfully hard for anything, let alone a book, to make my hair stand on end or give me gooseflesh, but I usually get at least one good case of crawling flesh from each of Lovecraft's stories and, in many instances, they delivered so much more.  Not since my first reading of Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE have I walked away from a book and had to shake it off physically before I could move on to something else.  There are many Lovecraft imitators out there.  But if you haven't tried a genuine Lovecraft, you haven't even begun to know horror 
 Hi, I( masters in computer science with 7 yrs of experience on j2ee ) really enjoyed reading the book, though I am new to web services. As the book discussed with finance related terminologies and examples it helped me very much as I develop banking applns in j2ee.  An excellent convincing explanation was given for allmost all  the topics even considering the new guys to web services.  Architects and programmers can read this book for a convincing explanation of the technology.  all the best.. 
 above average "based on fact" film. The actors work hard to carve out their personalities, and it sticks with you. What would you do 
 Sounds to me like the reviewer above is jealous of the wealth that Lazard generated for its owners and employees. Quite typical of many French people I have come across in fact 
 When I read I dogear pages with especially interesting quotes on them, & in this book I dogeared almost every page...& on each page I can't tell now what quote I was dogearing for, because everything he says is so amazing.  This book is so beautiful with its ingenius motion through psychology, architecture, poetry, & on & on.  Of all the books in my personal library, this is one of the very most highly recommended from me to any reader.  I am sure that no one was mistaken in hailing Bachelard as one of the 20th century's greatest philosophers 
 THese are marvelous!!  I had gotten a different style last February for mothers,,these adventure towels are great for the dorm and college kids...I love the snap strap and the pouch.  Now all of my children want them, too!!  Also love the up to date colors! 
 This is one of the most unique jazz albums ever produced and is an essential.  Miles's first essential album has him with a nonet (Two saxes (an alto and bari), one trombone, one french horn, one tuba, a rythymn section, and of course Miles himself).  There are three different nonets on this cd with that instrumentation, and he is joined by such greats as John Lewis, Gerry Mulligan, Max Roach, Lee Konitz, J.J. Johnson, and Kai Winding.  Each of the twelve tracks is unique in its own way, even though the same mood is sustained throughout the remainder of the album.  Even though all of the tracks are good, some highlights are: "Move", "Jeru", "Boplicity", and "Israel".  So if you're a fan of Miles's quintet/sextet stuff of the fifties and sixties, and want to hear him in a different setting than "Birth of the Cool" is for you 
 I have known I was adopted for all my life, but never had a real since of peace...This book help me see my real mothers point of view and I feel-helped me to forgive her.  I hope and pray it will Bless others as much as it Blessed me

This is a must have book for anyone who rides . . . the more you know about how a bike works, the better chance you have out the road when things go wrong 
 Jodee Blanco draws upon extensive, "real world" experience in heading up marketing campaigns that resulted in sixteen books climbing onto the New York Times bestseller list, in The Complete Guide To Book Publicity. Tips, tricks, and techniques covering the role of a book publicist, how to deliver an exciting interview, author tours, managing a crisis when something goes wrong, the when, why, and how of hiring an outside publicist, and much more. A solid resource of insider information from a veteran professional, and an absolute "must-have" for anyone considering or involved in a line of work involving book publicity and promotion. 
 Read this right after reading his childhood tale, Running with Scissors.  This is more believable, more relatable and more heartbreaking.  This is the one they should have made a film out of.  At times I was proud of him, disgusted with him, sad for him, and found myself rooting for him.  A sign of a well written book.  Can't wait to read the next installment 
 "The Women's Murder Club", introduced to legions of new fans in "1st To Die" and continued to wonderful effect in "2nd Chance", is an intelligent, plausible, modern idea whose time has come. Lindsay Boxer, a police lieutenant in charge of San Francisco's homicide division, Cindy Thomas, lead crime reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, Jill Bernhardt, assistant DA and Claire Washburn, Chief Medical Examiner, are four sharp, rising professionals in the field of law enforcement who have broken the proverbial male glass ceiling and have discovered the synergy of brainstorming their way to a solution of their mutual problems.   In "3rd Degree", the high speed action starts from the very first page as our ladies are confronted with the brutal terrorist attacks of an out-of-time 60s fringe group of misguided Berkley radicals targeting what they would label stereotypical mega-rich corporate robber barons and their families - better known to the rest of the world as millionaires. With the puffed up rhetoric of the far, far left, they take credit for one of their attacks with a note signing themselves as "August Spies" - "We have declared war on the agents of greed and corruption in our society. No longer can we sit back and tolerate the powered class, whose only birthright is arrogance, as they enrich themselves on the oppressed, the weak, and the poor."  The thriller part of the novel is a well crafted and nicely paced police procedural that takes us through vignettes involving forensics, profiling, post mortems, cooperation between the LA municipal police force and the FBI, the plodding details of policing at street level, and even the moral dilemma posed by the tragic requirement to withhold details of an investigation when this action may place the public in harm's way! The solution is both satisfying and credible and even the bad guys are well-developed characters that come alive off the page with their twisted motivation and hatred of the world around them.    As he did so well in "2nd Chance", Patterson continues to lift his tale above the realm of ordinary thriller by realistically allowing the personal lives of the four ladies to intrude on their professional lives (or is that vice-versa?). Lindsay falls hard for a professional colleague whose base of operations is clear across the country and Jill struggles with the emotional roller coaster of a husband's abuse that has recently escalated into the physical after she lost her baby by miscarriage in "2nd Chance". (I was, however, more than a little miffed to discover that the church pastor Cindy fell in love with in "2nd Chance" and Lindsay's ex-cop father, both of whom seemed to hold out so much promise for future sub-plots and character development were simply ignored in "3rd Degree" - sigh!)  Well done! I'll be out looking for #4 in the series shortly!  Paul Weis 
 All the wonderful pieces to a fantastic story. Compleatly unpredictable. (kind of like my spelling!) 
 Jake Steinfeld's I've Seen A Lot Of Famous People Naked, And They've Got Nothing On You provides a collection of 'street smart' business tips from a body builder businessman who is recognized as a fitness icon, and responsible for creating the personal fitness training industry. Does fitness translate to business savvy? Jake's seen a lot of celebrities stripped of their fame and fortune, and learned what made them succeed and failure: that knowledge helped him build a branded fitness product, a professional sports league, and more - and Steinfeld here shares some secrets of success. 
 I had originally checked this book out at the library, but upon reading it I've decided to "collect" the book. The book doesn't necessarily tell you new things that you don't already know, however, it does provide scientific support for the mental states that are often brought about by work related problems and how to resolve such problems. It's not a book for everyone. It's for those who are cognitively quick enough to grasp the concepts, what those concepts implies and emotionally apply them to their lives. If you don't have experience in those areas, you might not be able to fully appreciate what the author is saying. The advice are meant to be general. HOW you implement those ideas is another matter. That's where you need the cognitive and emotional leap.  For example, the author says,  six in 10 managers lost friends who weren't promoted as quickly is "a sincere but unpleasant form of flattery." Emotionally, how do you react to that statement? Does it calm you? Make you resolute in your effort to suceed? Or do you simply continue to feel bad that you've lost your "friends"? Your emotionally reaction is very indicative of how helpful this book will be to you.  The key word here is "emotional" and "cognitive" intelligence. If you're one of those person who ask questions like, "Is this a good time to buy real estate?" You shouldn't buy this book, because the answer is, "It depends on the real estate market in your local area."   If you can't determine if the real estate market in your local area is a seller or buyer's market...you really SHOULDN'T buy this book!!  
  So glad this became an option for us to get on DVD.  I loved the show when it was on the air and was mad when all of a sudden, it was just gone. I doubt her new reality show will top this one, although I will give it a chance. So Notorious is great and my husband and I will be able to laugh at each episode over and over again now.  Thanks to Tori Spelling for making this show, it was, and still IS awesome 
 As a family of six, our groceries comsume a large portion of our budget. This book has greatly reduced the amount we spend on groceries every month and the recipies are easy and delicious. My kids enjoy the foods and even my husband has commented on how wonderful everything smells. I have been amazed at how much it has saved us! A BIG Thanks to the authors for sharing the advice 
 Excuse me as I let "Little Johnny"...my five year old inner child review this book...  Hi. I loved this book. This book was great. This book made me laugh. I liked Max. I liked Max and how he put on a wolf suit. Max was funny when he went to the Island of the Monsters. My favorite monster was the one with the horns. I liked the drawings. I liked the story. I thought it was really, really good. Can I have some ice cream now?  Thanks "Little Johnny" and yes, you may have some ice cream, just save some for me.  As you can see by "Little Johnny's" review, the book is absolutely great and he's right. I think that this book is in its 9 millionth printing. It's the kind of book that will never age. Everything else will, but this book will always stay the same. I remember wanting to be able to draw just like Maurice Sendak. My mom said that she sent a few of them to him to Mr. Sendak, but he never replied, so if you are reading this Mr. Sendak, uh, could you look in your pile of fan mail and see if you have a large yellow manilla envelope that's postdated from 1969? My pictures are in there...by the way, my "Inner Child" says, "Hi"...  There are a few things that I hope I never get tired of (1) Being able to feel the Presence of Love around me and within me, (2) Being able to laugh at myself and (3) Maurice Sendak's, Where the Wild Things Are. It's just a wonderful snapshot of my childhood that brings me pleasure every time I read it.  Time for some ice cream, that is, if "Little Johnny" saved me some. The last few times he didn't. Oh, well...kids will be kids...  Peace and Blessings  
 Ok, perhaps I'm going overboard on the title of the review but, this album was it for the casualties that gave the punk scene a kick in the (...) and proved they were here to stay!! Ok, this version that's now available is the punkcore remastered which the album actually didn't have any problems on the recording but, they call it a remaster anyways...Has some extra bonus pictures. (punkcore seems big on pictures) Twas a duel rerelease origionally on punkcore 02 and charged 04 (charged be the label ran by Jake of the Casualties)  Heres the tracks that be on this CD: 1 Unemployed  2 No Rules 3 Stay Out of Order 4 Sell Out Society  5 No Room For the Youth 6 Underground Army (origionally by The Threats)  7 Rejected & Unwanted  8 American Justice  9 Political Sin (an older song from the early years finally recorded properly)  10 Kill Everyone  11 Here Today... 12 Punx Unite  Ok for you collectors here's a rundown on this LP Came out first on TribalWar records. This version had on the cover three young teens with mohawks in a black and white photo. Back cover had a chop and paste with the members and the classic style slop listing of the tracks. Inside booklet has info on TribalWar records and copyright Casualties all songs with threats copyright on Underground Army and if you open booklet up has lyrics to all songs minus underground army. But, theres also a very rare hand made version done by the members themselves with a custom cover Jorge on the left pissing on a wall and on the right Jake with a huge orange hawk. Back of the CD has the picture that later was used also on the "Who's in Control" 7" Inside cover has same backing as regular but, instead of copyrights has a paste over tribalwar logo and states contact info for Charged Records. Open booklet up and theres no lyrics just blank white. Theres only a hundred of these handmade version of the underground cd....Good luck on finding one....If you want to know about all the versions released on LP just drop a line... 
 This little plastic product is so quick and easy to measure your body fat percentage that you almost feel like it can't be that accurate.    But just for kicks I had my body fat measured with one of those fancy electronic machines several times before using the Accu-Measure calipers.    The average of three readings for the electronic device was 26% body fat while the Accu-Measure showed 25.5%.  Not bad considering this product is a whole heck of a lot CHEAPER than the electronic body fat machines.  I'm trying to get my body fat down to single digits and these Accu-Measure calipers will help me track my progress.  VERY affordable and they REALLY work 
 We will be  discussing this book among others at the Colby College Great Books Institute  this August . The theme of our selections is "Do Unto Others". I have  just finished reading  Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed  and cannot praise it enough. Beautifully written  and with with a powerful  message in light of current wars. Nonviolence must have deep roots and  strong branches  before it can bear the fruit of Le Chambon - a village  which rescued Jewish  children during World War Two. Pastor Trocme  and  Edouard Theis believed that nonviolence involves preparation and  organization -Page 35 -We might begin to prepare now  by learning about   these good  people (French Huguenots) who lived their faith . To them all  lives were precious. I hope others will read and review  this book  and  share their thoughts  with  us. tjl@ultranet.com Thelma J Lebeau 
 I once heard Tom Waits say, "I like hearing beautiful melodies telling me terrible things." That's the perfect description of this book 
 I picked up this deluxe edition for a very good price and I was blown away by the sheer brilliance of this man. A keyboard lover's wet dream to say the least. Washes of mellotron, synthesizers, drums and percussion, strings(real strings!) with the strings sounding like synthesizers at times. Sound quality is very good. A detailed booklet/history/notes from Klaus himself. A must have for fans. Disc 1: 4 tracks/79.45. Disc 2/3 tracks/79.43. The label side of the cds look like lps complete with grooves. Digipack. I prefer Disc 1 over Disc 2 due to the fact that Disc 1 is harder edged, lots of Tangerine Dream stylings and faster paced. Disc 2 is a bit slower but brilliant nonetheless. You may hear some slight distortion in spots on Disc 2 since it is the louder of the two particularly on track 3/the bonus track. Very minor quibble however 
 I don't really think this book needs my recommendation. It's a legend by itself already and I doubt what I have to say will influence your opinion more than the book when you actually read it. Still, I'll try to say what to expect and what not to expect.  Most readers don't need this warning, but some will probably catch the book because it's "well known and great". Remember, this is a classical novel, not some action one. If you need action and adventure, go elsewhere, just don't try to plow over the book and then give it a one-star rating - you have been warned.  Warnings aside, for a short description. The book is actually a case-study of one family's lives in a small village "on the edge of nowhere" (supposedly in South America, on the verge of the XIX and XX century, but this is not something you want to attach too much attention to, since the village is actually a sort of "neverland" and its geographical location is, I think, only due to the fact that Marquez felt better describing places that felt 'nearer' to him).  The book is actually a philosophical work, best described I think as a study of situations when a human being, though seemingly surrounded by friends, relatives and even loved ones, is actually alone. Hence the title - it's actually a study of solitude without solitude, a solitude among people. A study made by a brilliant writer, in a breathtaking style which makes the book read like a thriller. Marquez builds the magical place that is the village very meticulously, making you almost want to seek out this neverland in reality.  The main value of this book, its characters, atmosphere and the philosophy is not something you can describe in a review. You will just have to find it out for yourself. Which I greatly urge you to 
 What a gem! You will be inspired by this book.  From the title you might think this was going to be another rant against the Left with the usual diatribe. Had I not seen Ben Stein's discussion on C-SPAN I would never have thought of buying this book. But he presented himself so well in front of a fairly hostile university crowd that I was compelled to read the book.   The book is as impressive as his discussion. He demonstrates a thorough knowledge of history which he effectively uses to debunk the rhetoric of the Left. But even more important you feel a renewed sense of pride in the America we thought was lost in the years of media glorification of all sensational.  What strikes you when you read the book is the sense of patriotism and fair mindedness that the authors bring. Stein's heritage and current mindset make him a prime candidate to be in the ranks of the Democrats - namely his compassion, concern for the weak, and his love of justice - and all of this comes out loud and clear. The authors simply lay out why such a position is more suited to today's conservative mindset.  Throughout the book we also are presented with quotes from a variety of the Left's notables which should appall any but the most fervent partisan. Most of the quotes are scandalous when you take your 'rhetoric filters' off, such as Sharpton's 1994 quote, "White folks was in caves while we was building empires... We taught philosophy and astrology and mathematics before Socrates and them Greek homos ever got around to it." - Sharpton makes white neo-Nazi revisionists sound intelligent. Simply put this book proves that our nation is under attack by the Left and is a more serious threat than the terrorists.   Even if you are not convinced that you should reconsider your affiliations, you will be forced to reconsider your acceptance of many assertions such as the degree of poverty that exists in our country. The coverage of the spectrum of topics is clear and readable. Stein's wry wit is in evidence and completely enjoyable, such as a reference to his performance in 'Ferris Buehler's Day Off'.  My wife also read the book and is in awe of the level of arrogance that leaders like Al Gore exhibit and that as many citizens of our nation could buy into his positions. She also finds as do I that Stein offers a more reasoned and practical approach to the important political issues that surround us today.  The promise of the book is not just to expose the lies we have been fed, but also to offer a solution and an answer to the question of 'Can America Survive?'. The answer is a resounding yes primarily through education. We are given great reasons to embrace reasoned patriotism, reject the self hatred espoused by the Left, and a sound bibliography of books and other resources to draw from to help in that renewal.   After reading this book I have a renewed respect for imparting to my children our pride in this great country and I also have answers to the ugly messages that are being sent by those who loathe us. My hope is that the book's message will so resonate with the American public that the Democratic Party will rebuild itself to become a worthy opponent to the Republican Party, since our successful political system is built upon the balance of two strong parties that seek the good and welfare of the people. 
 Nice collection of hard-to-find Rackham images, but not the best color reproduction.  Still a good book for the Rackham enthusiast 
 This book has been a favorite in our home since we got it over 8 years ago.  The pictures are beautiful and fun.  The rhymes are great.  It is one of the few books that I do not tire of reading over and over and over again to the kiddos.  Only draw-back is that it is permanately stuck in my head.  Can't go to the zoo without finding myself saying the rhymes.  Oh, who am I kidding, that's not a draw-back...it is kinda fun!  hee he 
 I saw this album staring at me every time I went into a certain record store in a small mall near where I lived in 1968. Something about the five part photo-montage of the groups members intrigued me. No one did any trick photography/art on their album covers between 1966 and 1990 unless the group had something to offer that was exceptional. This happened with Angel's "Helluva Band" album, "Revolver" and "We're Only In It For The Money" and "Absolutely Free" and many, many other albums. While this wasn't as trick as THOSE boys, something told me to take a chance on it.   A very pleasant surprise! The first cut, "Fresh Garbage", is immediately likeable for its great bass and guitar work, drums and keyboards, and is probably the very first ecologically oriented tune after the Doors' "When The Music's Over" to appear on the scene back then. The next song, "Uncle Jack", is VERY heavy with drums, cymbals and fuzz guitar, with a delicate little keyboard accompaniment to offset it. Great arrangement! The next one, "Mechanical World", is the kind of song you'd expect to hear on the soundtrack of a short film decrying the soullessness of a technological/organization-man type society. It also is drum heavy, with a little orchestral punctuation, but quiet, reflective and it makes a major attempt to be profound, and succeeds on a rote basis.   Special mention must be made of "Taurus", which is a gorgeous song that's been used for more than one movie/tv show/whatever to make a scene seem haunting and otherworldly. I remember the late Juliet Prowse dancing to this on what might have been the Kraft Music Hall back in the late sixties. The woman had damned good taste! Also good are "Girl In Your Eye", which will relax the bejeebers out of you, and "Straight Arrow", the comedy relief cut.   The arrangements on all the songs on this album are absolutely faultless, with a major jazz influence, especially on the keyboards, and I remember one reviewer, (it might have been Robert Christgau,) stating that the first Traffic album, "Mr. Fantasy", and this one were somewhat similar. DON'T YOU BELIEVE HIM! Spirit sounded like NOBODY else, and back when all boomers were going through their Angry Young Man and Kim Darby stages, this was the kind of album we could have played for our folks and gotten their full approval, with the knowledge that what we were listening to wasn't garbage.   The sixties, seventies and eighties....the years they made music. What in the heck is coming out of the speakers now, primal screams? 
 Lost and Found was an excellent contemporary romance after so much historical romance.  It was well written and fun to read.  Enjoy ! 
 Baby Laughs is hysterical!! Jenny has a fun way of looking at motherhood. Motherhood is a tough thing that people can be very critical about. Jenny's laugh out loud view of motherhood helps moms not to take the criticism to heart. Great Job Jenny! 
 Another classic I really enjoyed. I did not know the story before and was actually surprised how good it was. The sort of classical story telling that seems to be hard to find these days. I can only recommend this book and can not wait to read another book in this series.. 
 I love it when you can learn something and enjoy a great story all at the same time!  A wonderful story about Queen Elizabeth I and her lover(?) Sir Robert Dudley.  The story delves into the question of Elizabeth's relationship with Dudley and how it affected her kingdom and court.  I read this book in just a few days and I can't wait to start "The Other Boleyn Girl"!  GREAT BOOK 
 Good techniques...but sometime you can come across such difficult people--nothing works. Still this book tells good stuff 
 This is an excellent book but only for those who have some understanding of what Zen Buddhism is and generally agree with its priciples, ideas and 'world-view'. If, on the other hand, you think that Buddhism/Zen is not your cup of tea or find it confusing/esoteric/strange, then you really won't get much out of this book.   For those of us who are lay or formal practitioners of Zen (it doesn't matter for how long), this book is one of it's kind in that it takes specific Zen practices/priciples and relates them to challenges and struggles a person faces when she/he is in a relationship.   My only issue is with some of the stories of 'real-life' people used by the author. They are meant to illustrate some point the author is trying to make but they end up being annoying, irrelevant or worse, counter-productive.  Overall: Highly recommended 
 A great story that I finished it in two days! A girl named Mary Lue Finny is told (along with the rest of her grade) to write a journal over the summer. She finds it fun and writes alot more then 1! You read her journal wich is stock-full of info about her summer. It turns out pretty bad when her cosin Carl Ray turns up for a visit! He's hear to find a job- or is he 
 In this academic book, the authors argue that most literature on learning ignores the social character of learning. The initial intention of this book was to "rescue the idea of apprenticeship." The authors studied the apprenticeships of midwives, tailors, butchers, and others. They found that learning, to a large extent, was taking place between peers, instead of coming directly from the master.  This book was written for academics, but has serious implications for practitioners.  Michael Beitler, Ph.D. Author of "Strategic Organizational Learning 
 Dr Kerry Back in my opinion wrote one the best if not the best practical book in financial Derivatives. In such a crowded field where books are published at an exponential rate; finding a practical book is often a challenge especially since many of them repeat the same information over and over. The best feature of this textbook lies in the problems at the end of chapters. The problems are well chosen and very practical and   require the use of VBA/Excel. This book does not get involved with complicated math as so many books in financial engineering do. I am doing a Phd degree in math, I deal with abstract mathematics on a daily basis so am looking for a textbook that will provide a good intuition to the concept of Derivative Securities without sacrificing too much Mathematical rigor. In this regard Dr Kerry Back did a very good job, the book requires only an understanding of non-measure probability theory, calculus, linear algebra and differential equations making it accessible to MBA students and undergraduates as well. I strongly recommend this book to math majors who want a textbook that explain Financial Derivatives well. I also recommend Stochastic Calculus for Finance II by Shreve for readers who want a measure theoric and PDE approcah to Financial Derivatives. 
 I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie's were diet. Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. My husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least, Peanut Butter.  Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls.  Nut Butter Balls doesn't sound as appetizing as what they actually are!! Nut Butter Balls.....Mmmmmm 
 In my view, Peter Robinson is one of our greatest writers of detective fiction: in his Alan Banks' novels, he has created a complex, interesting man struggling with his issues.  I am reading all of his Alan Banks novels chronologically, which I recommend because he refers to prior events in Banks' life, events that will not be as meaningful to the reader if he has not read the prior novels.  In "Playing with Fire" Robinson intrigues us with a series of fires that have claimed lives.  Are we dealing with an arsonist or could these fires be cleverly planned attempts to murder the victims?  As Banks pursues his investigation, the reader is swept up in exciting events, one of which almost costs Banks his life.  Robinson is in top form here as we join him in unravelling a fascinating mystery and in further developing the pains and pleasures of Banks' life in Yorkshire. 
 .... with a few new twists. I remember reading Tom Tryon's book when it first came out. It was frightful beyond anything else I had read at the time. When the movie came out I couldn't wait to see it. When I did finally see it I was both thrilled and disappointed. Translating a book with numerous rich characters and subplots to the screen is often a difficult task, as was in this case. But overall I think they did a great job. Watching this movie again, years later, I still feel the same because I can still remember how involved the book was. I am not hoping for a remake of the movie, that would probably prove a horrendous affair. But... judging the movie all on it's own I would have to say it is a very good movie. It is a period piece as well as being a thriller with drama set in. All the actors do a fantastic job. The sets and cinematography are great. This is a classic piece without a doubt. It has a slow build up as any good thriller should have. What is striking about this story is the slow development into unrecoverable terror that the story takes us on. When the momentum finally starts it's downhill roll all knuckles are white in anticipation of the final crash. But ultimatley it is a story of good and evil. In this case, both stuggling for the same body, ironically displayed in identical twins in this story. Very good twist on a classic theme! So, if you're tired of the sex-and-slice or gamebox movies, and want something with a stronger story and character development this would be the one for you. Hitchcock and DePalma fans will certainly enjoy this one

 "What will people say about me after I'm gone?" "After the funeral, and after the will, how will everyone think of me?" For the average young person, such thoughts are not important. However, once a person reaches their 50th birthday, such thoughts become much more important. That's what this book is all about.  The author looks at properties of life (like the Properties option in computer software). Interesting activities make the time pass quickly, but when we are bored, or doing something we don't want to do, time passes very slowly. A fundamental way to learn to move with the flow of life, instead of against it, is to understand change as an essential property of life. Regret is a built-in component of learning life's most important lessons. A life devoid of passion is a life lived at room temperature; we either have passion or we don't. Curiosity usually depends on imagination and courage to proceed; it is the spark that lets imagination burn brightly.  Various aspects of human life are also considered. No matter how famous we become, we will all die someday. Instead of celebrating the differences among people, a better approach is to concentrate on minimizing those differences. When you care deeply about something, the motivation to learn about it will follow. Those who choose reason over emotion are criticized for acting too cerebral or wanting to discuss unsettled questions.  How to help grandchildren (or other young people) develop an enthusiasm for learning and thirst for knowledge? People who are not learners cannot inspire others to be what they are not. Children will easily see through such pretension. Through your actions, convince your grandchildren that America's greatest treasures are found in libraries, not shopping malls. Help them to recognize the senselessness of confusing their identity with brand-name products. Help them to understand that the greatest defense against peer pressure is often found in the courage to be different. Help them to be wary of groups and organizations that discourage questions.  This a very interesting and eye-opening book. While it may be intended for people in their second half-century of life, it is very much recommended for people who have not yet reached that age. It is never too early to start thinking of the things mentioned here. Well worth reading.  
 One of the best feline books I have ever read! Gives a lot of insite into the Feline behavior, , and social structure. I have YEARS of animal experience and I walked away with a lot of new knowledge from this book. Definatly a must have or must read for any multi cats household!!! 
 I believe it is fair to say that Stevie Wonder's "Talking Book" doesn't get the recognition it deserves. "Songs in the Key of Life" or mostly his successful singles get all the recognition. Aside from the fact that "Talking Book" features two wonderful chart toppers ("You Are the Sunshine of My Life" and "Superstition"), it also features something that not many of today's artists display in their music: art. Stevie displays the talent he possesses here through his masterful vocals, priceless production, instrumental mastery, and his deep, poetic words. From beginning to end, every cut--from hard-edged funk to sweet ballads to political statements--is one-of-a-kind, and sure to bring out the human emotion in all of us. Stevie Wonder--a true musical artist with a talent that seemingly no one has, or ever will, surpass 
 Madonna took professional singing lessons for this role and it shows in this soundtrack. It is here that listeners hear a raw passion in a cultured voice which echoed a new sound for the singer. It is brilliant and holds true to the original rendition by the original Evita actress, Patti Lupone 
 Like all Allen Say's work, this book is splendidly illustrated. I love the story. It brings me back to my childhood in Hong Kong, where we kids sat outdoor and enjoyed bowls of sweetened soybean gelatin dessert bought from the door-to-door vendor while lapping up our mothers' gossip and real-life tales. The affordability of refrigerator in each home pretty much replaced the vendor. I remember as a little girl, I too had gone by my window one day and shushed the old man for clacking his clappers and yelling to sell his goods. Children and adults will both enjoy the stunning drawings, reading the words aloud, and appreciate the "once upon a time" story. 
 the unlaminated deluxe is great, easy to mark btw. but the laminated deluxe is simply fabulous. the size(21 by 16 inches, maps are not folded), the top-binding make the atlas much less clumsy to handle and the spiral-binding really makes sense. also the chart key is in the front. make sure you take a look of both before making your purchase 
 When it is too cold to ride  the trainer is perfect for your fix. I love my cycle-ops wind trainer because it allows me to get a good workout whenever it rains etc. It is relatively quite as well as being easy to fold up and put away. The bike fits easy with the built in skewers that lock perfectly without coming loose no matter how hard you hammer the pedals. You will feel confident  locked in because it is very stable. The video is a little cheesy and I only looked at mine once or twice when I bought it. The girl and guy are just too darned happy, meanwhile I'm going through pain and grimacing trying to keep up with them. If you are into spinning you can spin away and never leave the comfort of your home. All in all it is a good accessory to have if you are a dedicated cyclist 
 Hype is a funny thing...it makes people dislike bands before they even hear them. How anyone could not like something they never heard is a strange thought, but whats even stranger, is that even after people hear it, they still may not like it, even if they should....whatever circumstance you are coming from, you should like the Cold War Kids...  They are fun, brash, honest and creative. They are sincere and seem like a bunch of guys who are really having a good time. That is what rock and roll is supposed to be about. They play scathingly good live shows, bouncing around on stage and singing with vocal cords stretched to the limit. And they write the damn catchiest songs. The songs are inventive without having to be orchestral or using a catologue of quirky instruments. Instead it is stripped down. Guitar, Bass, Drums, Piano, Voice and some goddamn Soul. These Kids are bringing the soul back into the music. The singer channels Ornette Coleman and Nina Simones bastard child, and the band shambles along with a bluesy take on the Velvet Underground via Rolling Stones style rock and roll. A little slacker, a little swagger and a lot of Soul. A+++ in my book. and like I said, a GREAT live band.. 
 I have two 3 year old daughters who love all of the Richard Scarry videos.  This video helped them recognize and learn their ABC's much better than me quizzing them with flashcards all summer!  They will watch this video every day if I let them 
 Because I am in New york I have a lot of chances to get into the modeling world. Finally I have a good guide to help me get started. I especially love the runway photos which are exciting and very well done. This is a  great book 
 This was a request by my wife.  She loves Tom Hanks.  
 The title is misleading.  The careful reader will develop a more thorough grounding in business strategy than any MBA course can provide.  Especially useful for non-MBAs who want to understand the concepts that get tossed around during strategic planning 
 It was a cute book for my first grader to read.  I enjoyed it as well 
 The service is excellent and the product was in good condition and in time. Suni 
 This book contains absolutely one of the best explanations of the current Balkan fiasco.  While dwelling on Tito, West also explains the ethnic  disputes that have torn apart Yugoslavia.  West's coverage of the Ustasha  is particularly accurate and enlightening 
 The second season of Ghost in the Shell gets off to a very slow start, filled with talking heads that inform us how the political situation has changed since the previous series ended. It couldn't be more topical to contemporary America. You see, the main conflict of the show is being caused by a refugee problem. After the last war lots of Asians immigrated to Japan in search of a better life since their countries were poor and Japan was relatively rich. They were welcomed at first as a cheap labor force but over the years the Japanese began to think twice about the situation and realized that the immigrants are a huge tax burden. A new Conservative government has been formed, promising to deal with the problem once and for all. But there are elements within and outside of the government who are not prepared to wait for legislation. So, in the first episode here, a group called the "Individual 11" takes the Chinese Embassy hostage to protest against the parasitic immigrant population. Section 9 is called in to rescue the hostages, and if no innocents are killed, they are promised full reinstatement by the new Prime Minister.  In the second episode, another human being/cyborg scarred by the war and its effects, fantasizes about mattering in a society that doesn't recognize the need for love in individuals. He constantly daydreams about killing all the people he despises and even falls for the Major, who he mistakes for a prostitute. In the third episode, "Cash Eye" is the name of a thief who is so good that she even tells her victims when she is going to rob them! It's up to Section 9 to stop her from robbing a multi-millionaire who will be busy giving a sex-doll soiree at the appointed time attended secretly by very high-up dignitaries. Lastly, in an episode reminescent of an early episode last season, an attack helicopter whose pilot has had a heart attack is taken over by its AI and suspiciously, is joined by other unmanned aircraft in the immigrant district of the city. Their purpose....unknown. Section 9 is called in by one of the government intelligence services who seem very aware of the situation. As though they knew about it before it happened?  2nd Gig has a very different feel from the first season which seemed obsessed with Catcher in the Rye references and cyber crimes of sometimes Enron complexity. This first volume seemed firmly grounded in real-world problems. Namely, what do you do when the equivalent of a slave labor force begins to revolt against its masters and demand more rights? Some people believe they have the right to be here. Some that they should all be kicked out. When a population sees itself as threatened, they fight back, whether this population are the legal citizens or the immigrants. Of course, this show came out in Japan long before the current immigration issues that are now plaguing America. But it's just eerie seeing this. The situation in the US could very easily slip into the conflicts we see in Volume 1 of 2nd gig. Everything about this second season is top-rate....except maybe the writing. The second episode in particular is really slow, since Section 9 is hardly in it at all. While I liked the experiment they did by doing that, it's too early in the show to take the focus off the main characters. Yoko Kanno's music, while masterpieces, seemed to strain to make boring scenes dramatic, but most of her score improves the show, especially a homage to the first Ghost in the Shell movie when the Major falls backwards out of a high-rise, turning on her Predator-like camouflage as she descends after blowing a terrorist's head off. This show looks like it might be great, once it gets past the exposition.   Extras: Interviews with the director and two designers who worked on the show.   I would also recommend: The first season of Ghost in the Shell SAC. The two GITS feature films. The SECOND edition of the manga which features panels cut out of the original American release.  The Matrix trilogy. 
 In general, I like everything that I have read by Lama Yeshe.  He is very credible author from the Tibetan tradition with a gift for explaining things in easy to understand language.  He is also very gifted at presenting difficult ideas in a way that is easy to understand for Western people.  This book provides a nice introduction to the general philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism and a variety of compassion practices.  Specifically, it elaborates on the Dalai Lama's Avalokitashvera guru practices.  In addition, however, it also provides a broad context for any kind of compassion practice.  Tibetan Buddhism is not an easy worldview for most Western people to understand.  Lama Yeshe is great at bridging this gap and relating difficult ideas back to familiar Western psychological concepts, easy to understand analogies and everyday life.  If you are new to Tibetan Buddhism, this might not be the best place to start.  However, it is a useful complimentary text to other resources.  You can find a Tibetan Buddhism listmania list on my profile with specific references depending upon your specific area of interest.  I am not a Tibetan Buddhist myself, but I study world religions and find some of the works of the Tibetan Lamas to be difficult to relate to a Western paradigm.  If your interest is primarily scholarly, then Lama Yeshe will be more accessible than some other authors.  For an even broader context on Buddhism, try Huston Smith's "The World's Religions" or his volume on Buddhism.  Both of these are top notch and will help you to understand where Tibetan Buddhism fits into a historical and religious context.  It's easy to get confused if you start reading Buddhist works without this kind of roadmap 
 I like this book much better than Wild at Heart, though I tought students from it for about half a year. The basic thing I've taken away from the books is that it teaches us to be open about our futures and grab some nostalga along the way. Waking the Dead like Wild at Heart focus on what most conservatives will call OPEN THEOLOGY. This approach to God creates a sort of open question as to the future and whether we have a hand in it. John frequently sets up statements that lead conservatives to view them as redefining God, His intentions and what scripture says.  While conservatives can tear apart these writings based on John's innaccurate portrayal of scripture, none I have spoken with have not liked the book. One man said they got him off his duff, out dating again, and on with his life - all good.  Scripturally sound, no. Biblically accurate, no. Encouraging and exciting and forward thinking, yes. It's a great read but just not to be reconciled for accuracy 
  Agatha Christie's Murder On The Orient Express is an excellent movie.  When picturing Agatha Christie's Hercules Poirot from her description of him as fastidious, small statured and preening, I always thought it was David Suchet's portrayal that came closest. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that Albert Finney's portrayal of Hercules Poirot was also excellent. The entire star studded cast is one that cannot be faulted. They are all superb, bringing to life each character along with all the intrigue and suspense from the book. You enter the time period and feel the frigid cold of the stranded snowbound train almost as if becoming a passenger on the Orient Express yourself. Murder On The Orient Express is mystery entertainment at its best. ~ Mrs. B. 
 King did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one.  There were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing.  For the most part, not bad.  Would make a good movie 
 This is one of Danielle Steel's better novels. It had a pleasant and happy ending and is great for summer or vacation reading. I was captivated by it and couldn't put it down until I was finished.  It tells how 3 couples, who planned to vacation the following year in St. Tropez, France were met with tragedy when one of the couple's wives died. Robert soon began to date again and when it came time to go on vacation, he brought his new girlfriend, who was a budding actress. This did not go over well with the other wives and caused a lot of friction among the couples.  In the end, all of the preconceived notions about the new girl friend were eliminated and it taught a lesson to those who made quick judgments about others 
 ok this is like so many other sci-fi movies of the 80's(and the second of three underwater action movies that year)that you always feel like you have seen it before. the story is about miners on the ocean floor who find a sunken russian ship near them. after checking it out the find a video tape and a flask of booze.as two crew members drink from it they get very sick,and why not ,it has a drug that changes you into a blood craveing monster.   not the greatest,but i had fun watching it and if gore and f/x's are your thing you'll love it 
 This book does a good job of saying whether the creatures are real or not.  It provides evidence as well as hoaxes to these creatures realism.  Only one problem with the book though, the section on Black Panthers in NC.  I've seen a real life Black Panther in a cage at the Natrual Science Center in Greensboro.  These cats are real.  Still the book is very well written and done.  Was this review helpful to you?  YesNo (Report this) 
 "Stem Cell Now" is a rare primer that deftly provides a layman with a highly readable grounding in the science, moral controversy and political dimensions of stem cells.  Christopher Scott has an unusual perspective to bring to the subject as someone trained as a molecular biologist, but who also served as a business consultant and journalist.  Scott was not only an assistant vice chancellor of research at the University of California at San Francisco, but also a founder of the short-lived and highly-acclaimed "Acumen Journal of Science." As such, he plays comfortably in the intersection of science, business and society. Scott waits until the end of the book to offer his own positions on the issues of stem cell research, but his point in writing the book is that any discussion about the broader social issues should be grounded in the science. To that end, this is a welcome contribution to informing the discussion and a surprisingly breezy read for anyone who wants to understand the promise, the limitations and the controversy surrounding stem cells.

 I think my title says it all.  My husband wanted the soundtrack to the Highlander movie and I found out this was it and he loves it 
 This book is awesome !!!!!! 
 I've been on an Andy Warhol kick lately; I go through cyclical periods where I review his Diaries and read a book or two written about Warhol.  This was my latest find and it was very enjoyable, with a novel premise: Polsky's story is about his pursuit of buying an Andy Warhol painting.  Polsky recounts meeting Warhol briefly in 1986, shortly before Warhol's death, when he purchased a "minor" Warhol painting (one of the "$" paintings).  With engaging prose, Polsky details the ups and downs of the art market in the 1990s.  I have to admit that some of Polsky's anecdotes and comments about the art world's top dealers and celebrated artists were embarrassing.  It somehow gets tied together nicely, though, as the ever elusive Warhol masterpiece darts in and out of Polsky's hands 
 Ryen Denson		                           Mr. Taub  Sideways stories From Wayside School  These stories take place in a school called Wayside school. This is the weirdest school ever! The school is built wrong too. It was suppose to be built 1 story with 30 classes on that floor. But it was built 30 stories high with 1 class on each story. The people in the story are a little off too. For instance there is a teacher called Mrs.Gorf she tries to turn every kid that she sees into an apple! This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. I just love it. If you are into humorous books, your in for a real treat you will not stop laughing. 
 If you have any interest in the American Revolution, READ THIS BOOK!  Rebels and Readcoats covers every significant military action in the eastern colonies from Lexington to Yorktown.  The book is superbly researched and beautifully written.  I first read this book as a teenager forty years ago and loved it.  I read it for the fifth time last year, and I still love it 
 Resolve disputes and overcome differences with the help of The Way Of Conflict, where common traps to progress are outlined and implications of conflict outside the situation at hand are considered. Chapters handle everything from initial conflicts to escalation to violence, using first-person and real-world experiences to explore problems and solutions. 
 This is the best crumb topping I have ever made. I got rave reviews for my christmas pies and it was so easy cause it was already made for you. Just add a few things and done. What a pleasure 
 This book was awesome.  I read it as an assignment for a class in the midst of writing my undergraduate thesis, and it ended up shaping the entire direction of the paper.  Derber offers an explanation of problems many have already recognized but seemed to be unsolvable.  He specifically addresses the feeling that these problems are vague and just sort of "the way things are," and after reading this book, it is evident where specifically the problem is and what can be done.  He also makes an effort to explain his points in terms anyone could understand, whether they have a background in sociology or not 
 Although I was born in America and so have lived my life therein, I am English at heart and probably one of the greater Anglophiles in the Heartland.  This book had a few extra words and expressions that I hadn't heard.  The author and his opinions (he is obviously an elitist liberal who should look up the word "racism" and "bigot" before he applies it to people) should be disreguarded by any person with their own free will and ideas.  But overall, the book is a brilliant guide to understanding what Englishmen are saying to you if you are adventurous enough to explore the "non-tourist" townships of England and get to know the better part of Her Majesty's people 
 In this extremely well written book Mancur Olson applies his Noble Price winning 'Logic of Collective Action' to the real world. It tries to give a partial answer to the question: why do some countries get rich and others do not? Well: power groups emerge and make a society rigid. The society cannot properly respond to changes anymore. The theory is applied to a very large number of nations throughout recorded histrory: from ancient China and caste India to apartheid South Africa and post-industrial-revolution England. The only country/nation throughout the entire human histry he admids he has trouble understanding with this great theory is France. Read it 
 I love this game and I hate to sing, how ironic!!!  The only bad thing is the timer allows 20 seconds only, we bought a minute timer to make the game a little longe 
 Other reviewers have compared Somerset Maugham to Henry James, and I had to agree as I recently re-read his classic THE RAZOR'S EDGE.  The story is compelling, and has once again, after finishing, haunted me for several weeks.  However, this time I was even more impressed with the beautiful language and structure of the story.  Also, while there are many themes throughout, it was the passion of Larry Darrell's superficially passionless approach to life that stood foremost.  "Passion doesn't count the cost.  The heart has its reasons that reason takes no account of."  Despite the pragmatic restrictions, most of us want to live one's life as Larry chooses to do, and after absorbing Maugham's work, one inevitably will chart a new course.  An excellent read while traveling abroad... 
 Great Book! I Found These step-by-step guides easy-to-read, and easy to understand! The books are packed with information. They reminded me of "cliff Notes" from my college days.The information is comprehensive without the fluff you find in so many of the more expensive books out there on the subject. The books are also packed with resources such as phone numbers and the web sites of the companies they are discussing - there is no "theory" just great information 
 If you have never read Gathering Blue, you are missing out on an exciting adventure to a different world, where people with falws are forbidden to live in Kira's village. This book was sad at some points but what is a book with out emotion? Truth is its not a book if it has no emotion!!! I enjoyed reading this book a lot, and you will too!!! So get to the book store and buy Gathering Blue!!!! This was a great example of a five star book and how good it has to be!!! I will never forget how great this book is and how fun it was to read it!!! Lois Lowry is the best of the best author and has the most entertaining stories!!!!! Buy her books!!!!!!!!!!! 
 SPECTRE is back, and 007 has got'em.  This time SPECTRE plots to steal two atomic bombs and hold the world for ransom (a situation still very real for the world today).  A bit underrated by some James Bond movie fans, but I think it just gets better with age.  Sean Connery's personal favorite!  Still has the right stuff as James Bond.  Has by far the best looking bevy of Bond girls ever to grace the silver screen!  Claudine Auger, is my Bond Dream Girl as good-girl Domino.  Lucianna Paluzzi, lusciously evil as the first true Bond femme-fatale!  Adolpho Celi, a scary and most formidable opponent. Awesome production values, classic witicisms ("I think he got the point"), spectacular underwater action, and another classic John Barry score make this Bond effort a total splash! ****1/2 out of ***** 
 I bought this grapefruiter because I have a 6 year old as well as a grandmother in the nursing home who both love grapefruit.  They both need help sectioning it so I have always been on the look out for something to make this process easier and this is it.  It only took me one try or two to find the perfect position to get the whole section of fruit out.  It is a snap! I am buying another one as a gift.   
 As usual Greg word-smiths a real page turner. I was let down by the supposed god explanation toward the end. It was an attempt to roll Taosim (Dowism) and Agnosticism (google the Jefferson Bible)up into one. I hoped it would end with something better, BUT the book is a good book and has a pretty good ending, in spite of what I think. Read and enjoy just don't expect any revelations about Go 
 First of all, I really looked forward to this book. I read it in 3-4 hours in two sittings and it was very entertaining. Brendan Mullen wrote an extended article in SPIN Magazine on Jane's Addiction back when their Strays album came out a couple years ago. He states, at the beginning of this book, that band members more or less stopped giving interviews shortly after the albums release so he couldn't get additional information for the book. This forced him to search high and low for other key characters who surrounded Jane's Addiction, along with the band and management, in telling their complete story. It worked. This is a great book and gives an excellent perspective as to what Jane's achieved and what they were up against (primarily themselves). Anyone familiar with Jane's will notice a few familiar quotes and paragraphs from past interviews dating back more than 15 years. Mullen pulls from all sources and paints a good picture of band's impact on the LA music scene at that time and the argument that they created the alternative scene that Cobain and others were able to blow the doors open on a few years later. The development of Lollapalooza is very interesting as well. This book would receive a five star rating had the band done interviews more recently specifically for the book. Unfortunately, they didn't and you have to stick to their old interviews which in many ways is good for catching the moment but not as good for catching the band's perspective on their impact over time. Had they done interviews it may have turned out more like the Crue's DIRT. But Jane's was a much darker band, and you definitely get the feeling here. Actually it sounds like Porno For Pyros was more drug-addled than Jane's, if that's possible. This is a biography and almost gets 4.5 stars. The 5 Star books will be the complete autobiographies by Avery, Perkins, Navarro and Farrell. They'll come in time. Long live Jane's Addiction, one of the last truly great rock 'n roll bands......  
 I LOVED HARVEY FROM THE MOMENT I SAW TORCH SONG ON SCREEN. I'VE BEEN A FAN OF HONESTY, SINCEREITY AND COURAGE AND DOWNRIGHT HUMANITY SINCE BEING EXPOSED TO HIS BRILLIANCE. I'M AN UNDYING FAN SINCE.  THIS STORY SHOULD BE AN EYE-OPENER TO THOSE WHO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYONE - HOWEVER SUBTLY - FOR WHATEVER REASON, SEXUALITY, RELIGION, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR EVEN IF ONE IS BLACK, POOR AND FROM NEW ORLEANS AND DON'T HAVE BUS FARE TO ESCAPE HURRICANE KATRINA.   DENIAL KILLS.  I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH FOR THIS TO COME OUT ON DVD.  I AM BUYING MY COPY NOW!   
 This is an extremely brief single-disc summary of B.B. King's MCA output beginning with his first single for the label, 1963's "How Blue Can You Get?" through his pairing with Robert Cray on "Playin' with My Friends" from 1993's Blues Summit all-star recording.  Among the many highlights are two tracks ("Every Day I Have the Blues" and "Sweet Little Angel") from the essential Live at the Regal, "The Thrill Is Gone" (which went to No. 15 in 1970, making it the highest charting blues song ever on the U.S. pop charts!) and the chilling "When Love Comes to Town" with U2. While condensing 30 years of music onto a single disc is an impossible task, this makes an excellent primer for novice fans on a budget.   RECOMMENDED  [Note:  Last November MCA released the 2-disc B.B. King Anthology.  It includes EVERY song on Greatest Hits, plus an additional 18 songs. For a few extra bucks, this would be the album to get instead. 
 This is the best all time live album ever! Kick-ass R/B with outstanding horns! The duo Winter/LaCroix not only works but their vocals are most impressive! Too bad this band broke up just shortly after releasing this album becuse it went "Gold" before they knew it ! I got a chance to hear them twice after their Recycled album which deserves 4 Stars and their live performances are burned into my memory banks. Perhaps Winter and LaCroix will join again with as many old band members and release new material. Dreams do come true 
 As always, Kellerman has not let the readers down. This book had me hooked from the first page. I hated to put it down.

 After two uncharting albums of country material, Rhonda decides to return to her bluegras roots with this fantastic album.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this album, but I'll try.  The album starts off with 'Lonesome Wind Blues' which Rhonda often opens her live shows with, this uptempo bluegras tune is sure to please any fan! However, the standout track for me is Rhonda's cover of Dolly Parton's classic 'Jolene', this is by far the best cover of the song, far surpassing Sherrie Austin's recently released version.  Other standout tracks for me on this album are 'Keep Your Feet On The Ground', 'Where No Cabins Fall', 'Passing Of The Train', and 'When I Close My Eyes'.  This album is a must for any Rhonda/Bluegrass fan 
 This is an excellent starter for your search on important facts about hemp and its commercial uses. There are some medical notes in this for those interested. I had the money to purchase a million copies I would give them away. Ho hum. No mun! Please take the facts in this book real serious. No joking. This is a must read for all even you smart ass stoners. 
 One of the great Ealing comedies.   Sellars is brillian 
 Fish Oil: I love it. I'm happily benefiting from one of the truly great all time, American deficient, foods -- Omega 3 Fish Oil. It is truly a wonderful food; skin, inflammation, mental function, depression and the list goes on.  I finished my first bottle and orderd three more.  It makes a huge difference in my skin. I'm sure it's doing more great things for me, but it's so exciting to see and feel results too. I've always had keratosis pilaris (also affectionately known as "chicken skin") on my upper arms. I've tried lotions and scrubbing for years, but the fish oil is the only thing that has made a visible difference. I don't break out as much on my face either. And, for years I've been someone who breaks out with random skin rashes - usually on my neck and back - without good reason. Dr.s have perscribed topical creams that act as a panacea for everything that comes up. But the redness is always there beneath the surface.  It actually looks like the redness is gone since using Carlson's.  This fish oil is so great. You've got me hooked for sure.  
 Investigative reporter Annie Anderson worked extremely hard and had made it when she abruptly quits her job at London Post to accept a position as a fashion editor at Handbag Magazine.  Her peers at the Post assume the last case burned her out as she went undercover to expose a juvenile prostitute ring in which an innocent person was murdered.  It remains in the blood for Anne to go undercover so she hides her credentials and travels to New York to expose the fashionista class to her readers.  Her editor Rebecca Brooks demands she also interviews the hottest designer of the moment Mark Miller.  He is forthcoming answering all her questions except anything involving his supermodel lover drug addict Patty Lang or the immediate future of his new company that most insiders believe he will sell.  However, the future ends abruptly for Mark when someone shoots him.  While the police investigate his murder, Annie interviews associates of the victim though some refuse to speak of the dead.  In Milan, Patty is murdered.  As Annie continues to investigate, she uncovers a piracy rip-off of designs that places her in jeopardy  Annie is a strong center holding the investigative look into the fashion world together.  Her homicide inquiries are fun to follow as she seeks a killer while searching amongst way out designers and misanthropic models who aggressively compete in a to the death queen of the hill (make that runway) contest that make the Yankee-Red Sox rivalry look like chicken salad.  Sam Baker provides a wonderful who-done-it and readers will want her to return with more Anne undercover investigations.  Harriet Klausner  
 I am working on a novel and the male hero (if you wiil) is in the Navy  during WWII. This book created his job and a lot of his persona and some of  the plot as he goes to sub chaser school etc. even if you are not a WWII  scholar this book would still do good to read because it gives a piece - a  small piece - of the great sacrifice that was made  
 This is an excellent in-depth biography of the Stones and their music.  It's an easy read, full of interesting information, lots of good photos, and covers the entire career of the bad boys of Rock and Roll from their early days till the time of the book's publication.  It is well-researched, balanced, fair to all involved, not overly fawning, and filled with new information I had not read elsewhere.  I highly recommend it.   Five stars

 These are absolutely the best translations of the Gawain- (aka Pearl-) poet around. It's diabolically tricky to translate the Middle English of this obscure, anonymous poet, due to the fact that he combines the accentual, alliterative prosody of the native tradition with the rhythmic and rhyming verse of continental models. Of all the translators who have attempted it, Borroff by far provides an experience closest to reading this brilliant verse in the original.  These translations were originally published in short paperback versions of each poem. These are often still available from used booksellers. If you are only interested in one poem (probably Sir Gawain), look for one of these used paperback versions, and save your money. Patience and Purity (or "Cleanness") are wonderful poems, but they are not really of much interest to the general reader, and are mostly studied by scholars or by grad students. 
 This is a pretty good addendum to Yoshimi.  I think the level of distortion on "Sunship Balloons" is a bit much and detracts from such a great song.  I like the dashes of new wave thrown in to the mix.  All in all, another excellent FL album and reasonable at $10 
 While this book is not the best Rollins one out there, it's definitely satisfying for anyone who has read and enjoyed his other books. While I think his new book Black Order is by far his best work yet, this book is not at all bad and kept me very interested and compelled at what was coming next throught the entire book. With the book's setting and plot both involving  the Arabian peninsula, I was a little hesitant about reading it because I haven't had any particular interest in reading about the area, but as usual, Rollins makes everything work very well and it's just another very good book in the Sigma series.   Returning Rollins readers: definitely get it.  New Rollins readers: because each book stands well on its own as well as in a series, I'd read Map of Bones or Black Order first, but really, anything by Rollins is great 
 Wow, this little parable is a world changer! Especially for those who get caught in the rat race of just climbing, succeeding, bigger, better, etc. I read it through the lens of church and American spirituality...a flawed version of Christianity...and it really puts life back into focus 
 This is with out a doubt the best of Gustave's biblically inspired works. His mastery is proven by creating a visually stunning and poetic world of a time long ago but not forgotten. It's hard to remember what I used to  imagine when I thought of the Garden of Eden or the descension of the  fallen angels must've been like prior to reading this work 
 This CD was in excellent condition--and, of course, it is a classic. It was a joy to hear 
 Reservations about the recording quality are inevitable, and of course when Astaire was involved the songs are always better when you can watch him dance and hear his tapping, but that said, there is no greater American musical in my opinion than this one.  The title song, simple as it is, is so evocative of New York and the 40s and the hope of a new season that I almost cry every time I hear it.  To me, it is the best song Berlin ever wrote and one of the very few best American songs ever written. The rest of the disc is one great number after another, with Judy Garland in top form and Fred Astaire constantly revealing that it is phrasing and timing more than a great voice that make a great singer, which he undoubtedly is.  Indispensible music 
 If you are looking for a good beginner's book or just one to brush up on your knowledge and terms, this is a great book. And it comes with 3 patterns. 
 I had no idea this is the "UK issue," when I picked this up. I love this album. All the songs are very catchy. You just have to tap your foot. The cover art is interesting...I'm sure all the men picked this one up instead of the other version.  I think The Strokes should've kept NYC cops on the other version, it's way better than that other bland song they chucked on there. Anyway, I absolutely love the song "Last Nite." But all the other tracks are equally good.  I don't know, is this garage rock? Or "indie" (what is that btw?) Or just plain old rock? Don't ask me. (Because I wouldn't know.) All I know is that this is great rock. Whatever type it might be.   Highly recommended! 
 Many of us have a story to tell, perhaps, it is a work of fiction or non-fiction, one that may be entertaining, useful, informative, or inspirational. However, the foremost difficulty we encounter is locating a publisher who will make our dreams come true. As pointed out in Mark Levine's The Fine Print of Self-Publishing: The Contracts & Services of 48 Major Self-Publishing Companies-Analyzed, Ranked & Exposed, until recently there only existed three ways to become a published author. These can broken down as follows:  having a traditional publisher take you on: pay a vanity publisher a great sum of money to print your book: or take the self-publishing route which required you to handle all aspects of book publishing from printing, design, formatting, etc.  Today, with the advent of modern technology and the Internet, another alternative exists, the print-on-demand (POD) possibility that provides authors an opportunity to publish their work. Basically, as Levine mentions, the POD path allows a book publisher or printer to produce the number of books actually ordered. These publishers are a hybrid of traditional publishers, vanity presses, and self-publishing companies.  As a book reviewer, I have reviewed many a print-on-demand (POD) book; however, I must confess that I never bothered to compare one POD publishing company with another.  In certain instances, I did notice that some of these companies were nothing more than glorified printers masquerading as publishers, while others were serious and were sincerely interested in helping their authors.   The Fine Print of Self-Publishing limits itself to analyzing forty-eight royalty-paying PODs that have several common features, namely: they accept submissions from new or inexperienced writers without the necessity of having an agent,  books are published within ninety days or sooner, no advance payments are requested from the authors, there is very little or no marketing budget for the book but sometimes these services are provided for a fee, pay higher royalties than traditional publishers, and charge up-front publishing fees.   Divided into nine chapters, Levine wades into the world of PODs by initially pointing out nine qualities of a good self-publishing company which include a good reputation among writers, an attractive easy-to-navigate web site, fairly priced publishing fees, generous royalties without creative accounting, low printing costs and high production value, favorable contract terms, reasonably priced additional services, ability to obtain an ISBN, UPC Bar Code, and LCCN as part of any basic publishing package, and the ability to register the book with Bowker's Books in Print, make it available through a book distribution such as Baker & Taylor or Ingram, and listing it on Amazon and other sites. After exploring these essential elements, Levine, who is an attorney by profession as well as an author, proceeds to give us a brief course on contracts and what to watch out for before engaging ourselves with any one particular company.   The remaining chapters of the book focus on four types of self-publishing companies: outstanding, pretty good, okay and those to avoid. According to Levine, he has contacted every one of the forty-eight companies listed in the book and he had requested replies to a series of fifteen questions. These questions highlight such topics as the retail price of a book, book returns, shipping charges on books, the price an author pays for a book, are the book covers laminated, and several other important issues. With this wealth of information in hand, Levine then goes on to rate each company and meticulously  breaks down his analysis of each one into the following sections: format of books, genres accepted, publishing fees, royalties paid to authors, notable provisions of the publishing agreement, time from submission to publication, Alexa traffic rank of the publisher's website, author-friendly rating. Mention is also made of the URL of the company's site and if their contracts can be downloaded.  My only criticism of this book is the absence of an index and a listing of each company analyzed and categorized into their rating classification.  All the same, it is quite apparent that Levine has done his homework and this in depth guide is undoubtedly an eye-opener as well as an excellent working resource for anyone contemplating self-publishing.

 What a fantastic way to learn about John Adams! What a great way to be introduced to excellent historical biographical writing!  McCullough is a brilliant and exciting writer. He truly makes Adams come alive, and when Adams inevitably dies at the end it is a very sad thing!  Adams is truly a hero of the Republic. A great friend, then a great rival, then a great friend again of Thomas Jefferson, Adams is undeservedly overlooked by many students of American History.  Adams the republican vs Jefferson the populist was the great debate in American history and still continues today. Adams saw the horror of the French Revolution for what it was and predicted that it would end in depravity and violence and likely cause a savage reaction which would bring about the end of the French Republic itself. He was right, Bonaparte quickly followed the French Revolution and war across europe was the result. Jefferson on the other hand embraced the French Revolution as an expression of the people's desire for liberty. How wrong he was!  Adams was a brilliant Statesman, and student of history. A wonderful family man and superb husband Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail is a classic in American literature.  As a youth I spent many hours on the grounds of the Adams Mansion soaking up all the history there as much as is possible. McCullough does so well what so many biographers do so poorly and that is he captures the times of the subject and places the person in his rightful context. He brought me back to the grounds of "Peacefield" through his beautiful evocations of it as it hosted great people and great events.  History is best studied by understanding how historical figures lived and understood their own lives and times, as they lived them. Hindsight is an overrated tool in historiography.  Bringing the past to life in writing is a special gift and McCullough has it. Enjoy his talents and get to know the foundations of the American nation a story that is not fully known by so many. Adams' story deserves to be told. What a brilliant man, and McCullough does him superb justice in this highly readable biography.  So much can be said here about Adams, but it's not necessary as McCullough has written the definitive John Adams biography and says it better than I. Get to know John Adams through this superb book, you will be glad that you did. And your opinions on Jefferson will likely change, too! 10 STARS! 
 I found the reader who didn't like the editing to be well reasoned, but I found the volume as a whole great.  I would have liked more letters.  The poems are great, and then you have Italian Journey, perhaps Goethe's most underrated book but Thoreau's favorite, which is how I got into Goethe in the first place, along with Werther and a novella and elective affinities.  It's a pretty looking volume, too (I know I know).  As far as the introduction, I agree it's a bit too blah blah we love Goethe.  I read a book by a guy named Strich the other day called Goethe and World Literature, written just after WW2, with great praise for Goethe and a sense of relevance as a potential unifier of Europe.    As far as Goethe's writings, I honestly don't get the whole big thing about Werther.  A bitchy boy in love kills himself oh woe.  Italian Journey is amazing.  It's nice to get a little stoned and read that book for hours. 
 Outstanding historical book with deep insight into both the immediate and extended Roosevelt family.  McCullough make reading and learning history easy and enjoyable.    
 This is a simply gorgeous book.  Kinuko Y. Craft is such a magnificent illustrator.  All of her images are detailed, delicate, and deep 
 This "Il Barbiere di Siviglia" from Madrid isn't perfect, but I think overall it's the best choice available on video. For one, it's fairly complete -- and then some. Recitatives are slightly abridged, but musically all the numbers are there, and there's an extra aria for Rosina in the second act, "Ah, se e ver che in tal momento".   The production is also pretty inoffensive. I don't like some things about it -- for instance, having everything onstage in black and white patterns except for the colorful finale seems too cute by half. Plus, Bartolo's house is way too grand -- it belongs more in Der Rosenkavalier. But overall, it's not at all "Eurotrashy."  The cast is also overall very strong. The main reason to get this dvd is of course Juan Diego Florez's Almaviva. Florez makes Barbiere *his* opera. His voice is clear, bell-like, with a fast vibrato that gives his singing an ardent "pulse." Florez is also very musical, decorating his arias tastefully, with wonderful use  of appogiaturas. He also is blessed with a beautiful, secure high C. He brings down the house with Almaviva's extremely long, difficult aria at the very end of the opera, "Cessa di piu resistere." On top of all that, Florez also has an exuberant stage personality. His scene-stealing as the "music teacher' during the Lesson Scene is extremely amusing. AND he's very handsome. What more could one ask?  The rest of the cast is also generally strong. Pietro Spagnoli (Figaro) has a handsome, round baritone voice. I like how in this production during "Largo al factotum" he hands out "coupons" to his customers. It gives Figaro a chance to do *something* in an aria that is often stand-and-sing. But overall, Spagnoli doesn't make much of the role -- he's the title role, but he made the least impression on me. His Figaro is rather joyless, without any sense of mischief.  The comic relief is better. Bruno Practico is a delightfully foolish Bartolo, and does a good job with "A un dottor." Ruggiero Raimondi's basso voice has dried up quite a bit, and at times he sounds hoarse during "La calunnia." He's still a good actor, though, making Basilio delightfully megalomaniacal and amoral. He adds enormously to the fun in this production.   The real weak link in the cast is Maria Bayo as Rosina. Maria Bayo is actually blessed with a pretty, bell-like soprano voice. She ornaments her arias "Una voce poco fa" and "Contro un cor" tastefully and imaginatively. Her problem is that she simply doesn't have enough spunk and charm to be believable as Rosina. This Rosina is too "dolce" and not enough "vipera." It doesn't help that she's saddled with a frumpy, curly black wig that does her face no favors, and a frumpy polka-dot black dress.  Oh well. One can't ask for everything. There's a nice bonus disk with an hour-long documentary about the opera, with interviews with the cast. Florez has such a wonderful speaking voice, by the way 
 Vikram Seth's Two Lives is a biography, a memoir, a novel and a collection of letters rolled into one. The landscape it covers includes India, Germany, England and America, and the timespan includes most of the twentieth century. An Indian Hindu, Shanti comes to Berlin, Germany in the beginning of 1930s to study Dentistry, forms friendships with both Christians and Jews and Henny (who is of same age, and his landlady's daughter) becomes his particular friend. After finishing his studies, Shanti returns to England, where his degrees are not recognized, and he takes exams again. He enlists and fights in second world war. Loses his right arm, and yet battles on with his left hand to become an able dentist again.  Henny must part from her family and make her escape to London. Throughout 1940s she bears the news of one killing after the other, as under Hitler, Germans seek out the Jews and exterminate them. Henny corresponds with Shanti who is fighting in the War, and corresponds with friends left in Germany. The stash of letters that Vikram Seth uses and copies in this memoir is a telling tale of what millions of Jews suffered through in the 1940s and thereafter. Henny meanwhile works her daytime job, and in beginning of 1950s marries her lifetime friend and companion Shanti.  Henny and Shanti are two lives in focus here. The lives are inspirational, while their times full of war, misery, deaths, separations, and treachery. Through their life stories one comes face to face some of the greatest horrors from previous century. The World War II and action against Jews feature as the backdrop in which the valor of the protagonists and the depth and sincerity of friendships they had with people is tested. Historical perspective provided by Vikram is well researched. The story puts you face to face with not only the pre-1950 horrors, but also raises some important questions about present day world, say Israel-Palenstine conflict and US-Middle East divide.  In some places, the book is almost auto-biographical. In the beginning of the story, a teenager, great-nephew Vikram Seth arrives at the house of Shanti and Henny. He sets up his personal association with the two lives in his characteristic witty, simple but effective writing. Vikram Seth is one of my favorite living poets and writers. Having read all his novels, and nearly all his poems, I loved the beginning for it describes the writers own struggles and coming of age as well as how and when his various works were written. While the main story is of Shanti and Henny, Vikram's own story is an interesting third element that makes this memoir worth picking.  Yet maybe because the theme is so complex,  maybe becuase it is a memoir, maybe becuase it speaks of such turbulent times and for Heeny's life progresses through her own correspondences, Vikram Seth's Two Lives is not as easy and straightforward reading as his previous novels. The story of Henny during 1940s has too many characters, and these come in and go rather quickly. Perhaps the idea there was to emphasize the events, rather than personalities (quite unlike in Suitable boy), and the letters, the narrative weaves a heart-wrenching description of Berlin through racial hatred, through bombing, and through division after the war.   Vikram Seth strives to provide a lifelike potrait of both Henny and Shanti. Hence, he strives to outline aspects from their daily routine that he witnesses himself, his other family members perceive by themselves and what he gathers from his conversations with Shanti and from letters of Henny. He is telling the tale of real people, related to him. Only an author of his calibre can create such a rich, likable, must read memoir using these tid-bits of information and working with and against his own personal relationships. Vikram doesn't make Shanti or Henny into just heroic survivors of various tragedies and catastropies. Neither does he magnify their life sagas or characteristics. He provides snapshots of their successes and failings, of their quirks and habits, of the complexity of relationship and marriage, and of their painful approach to death.   Two Lives is overall a great memoir that one ought to read to feel inspired by the protagonists, to become aware of horrors that our grandfathers faced, to understand our present world and to appreciate how well a writer like Vikram Seth can weave a saga from such varied elements. People like me who have read other books  by Vikram Seth might be surprised by presence of some obscure parts in the book, but the story itself requires a degree of uncertainity, of vagueness, of incompleteness. If it were fiction, one could have reproached Seth for spending too much time on deaths of protagonists and on their life after 1960s. Especially some of the family disputes could have been pruned. Here in the biography, he needs to pull all elements of their life together, and like he must, he describes events in 1930s and 1940s in greatest detail.   The narration of events in Germany from 1930s and 1940s, the copies of Henny's correspondence during that time and Shanti's personal reminisces about the second world war and dentistry with left hand are transformed into a must read biography by one of the greatest living writers of our times. Go, read it. 
 the more they remain the same. This old truism is a succinct description of this collection of essays and articles by Bernard Lewis. The collection spans well over half a century of scholarly work of this doyen of Orientalism and Near Eastern studies. It is a fascinating walk through many facets of the rich history of the Middle East, and if you are new to the subject, as I am, it is probably one of the best starting points to the field. Many articles touch upon the subject that are as relevant today as when Lewis first wrote about them, which in many ways is a bit unsettling. I am always a bit skeptical about the use of ancient feuds and disputes as a justification for modern-day conflicts, but if a certain theme persists more or less unchanged for many centuries, then it would be foolish to ignore it. This book can be an invaluable resource to anyone wishing to cast aside those foolishnesses and better understand what is going on in that part of the world. In the example of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Lewis convincingly shows how it was both ancient and modern, fundamentalist and contemporary. It would not do the full historical justice to treat it just in the light of the fundamentalist rhetoric, nor through a prism of contemporary revolutionary rhetoric. Showing the interplay of those two themes is what Lewis excels at, and this book is replete with similar examples.

 DO WHATEVER YOU MUST TO GET THIS BOOK 
 BECAUSE OF THE SUPERB CHAPTER ON ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL PERIODS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES - THE PANIC OF 1907 - THIS MAKES THIS BOOK THE PREMIER BOOK ON THIS PERIOD IN MY OPINION.  M GORDO 
 I thought this was a good book. One of the many that keeps you turning the page due to suspense. Ralph Roberts had no clue that his Insomnia would lead him to heroism and he would finally get to "sleep". Stephen King's one of a kind creativity definitely comes to play here. I would recommend this book to anyone. I think anyone would enjoy the suprise ending in finding out about the "promise" 
 The cast alone makes this one of the great films of all time.   The acting is superb, the characters are portrayed as likeable and keep you cheering for their cause.   It is, perhaps, Steve McQueen's greatest film right up to and including the best motorcycle footage ever at the end.  Charles Bronson is never better.  The action/drama is intense and builds quickly to a brilliant and moving finish.  Every movie affecionado will want this one for the memorable characters.  
 Please listen to this music.  I first heard this album when my father brought it home. He and my mother went to one of Piazzolla's performances with his small band of 'tangueros' (tango musicians) playing at an basement, an unrderground Pub. The music, my father told me later, was sublime, so he brought the LP record of 'Reunion Cumbre' that  he purchased after the concert, and after talking to Piazzolla to congatulate him for his great music. Although this album seems at first to be in a different direction with regards to the music that Piazzolla composed and played, it is very much Piazzolla, as he was exploring all the time, and playing with Jazz musicians as he also loved Jazz (he was brought up in New York). But I guess he loved Argentina and that is why he returned to it and to his native city of Mar del Plata, where my father had the chance to listen to him.  There is this piece in the album, 'Años de Soledad' that makes my argentinian bones tremble so much, that I am definitively sure it should replace our national anthem. Anyway, the whole album is great 
 I just purchased this book and am a new scrapbooker / card maker.  I found this book a complete joy.  It gives you step by step directions and photos to help you along the way.  Prior to beginning each card the book lists the supplies you will need to complete each project.  I thought a great plus was the book provides step by step instructions on envelope making for the cards.  This book is AWESOME!!!!! So easy to use and fun!!!! 
 When it comes to Lexicons this is the only one I will use, or suggest to others.  This text makes it so easy to first find a word, then investigate the shoresh.  The style of having the word on the left and having the shoresh on the right, which the reader can go and look up works perfectly for me.  I learned most of my Biblical Hebrew from using this Lexicon alone.  The areas of the book that may be a little hard to read are the grammer elements.  I used other books for the grammer of Biblical Hebrew, but that did not take away from the value of this Lexicon.  I will say that this Lexicon is for a somewhat seasoned veteran of the Hebrew language, but once you get the hang of how it works it is perfect 
 Andre Dubus' writing is like having a conversation with an old friend.  He tells it "like it is."  He invites us into his life and the broken people who are present there. He holds nothing back, leaving us to witness his brokenness without any regret on his part. If you've never read  essays, or have never enjoyed them before, I highly recommend this book as  well as Dubus' "Meditations from a Movable Chair."  These two  works are wonderful reading!  They both move quickly and the literary form  of the essay allows one to pick up and read each essay separately, and not  have the pressure of reading a whole book.  Also, each essay is very  reflective and thought-provoking so as to add a spiritual dimension to  these works. I would recommend reading "Broken Vessels" first,  then any of Dubus' other works, as "Broken Vessels" gives us some  insight into who this person, Andre Dubus truly is 
 This was a really fascinating book, weaving early twentieth century American historical figures with fictional characters.  I found the characters of Evelyn Nesbit, Harry Houdini, Pierpont Morgan and Henry Ford to be very interesting.  Emma Goldman as well.  I enjoyed the inventive conversations between historical figures fascinating, particularly the one between Pierpont Morgan and Henry Ford.  It was also really funny.   I also found the fictional characters to be interesting.  Coalhouse Walker was interesting, although I am not sure what I think about his transformation.    All in all, this was a highly inventinve book, and I recommend it, particularly to people interested in this time period in history. 
 I first heard of Alice Domar and the Harvard Mind-Body Institute's Infertility Program in an article which highlighted a research study that found that infertile women who underwent a relaxation program had a higher rate of pregnancy than a control group.  Living nowhere near Boston, I was very interested to discover that Dr. Domar had written a book.  The book is wonderful and I recommend it to people going through infertility all of the time.  I am not one to go for touchy-feely stuff, and this is not at all like that.  Rather, it is a down to earth, medically-based, normal, and intelligent approach to getting our lives together.  It is a very important companion to anyone undergoing infertility treatment 
 This is a brief story, about 75 pages, but packs in all of Hammett's hard-boiled best. The mysterious, beautiful woman appears one night, with a trail of trouble catching up to her. Our hero, if you could call him that, offers his help without knowing what help she needs. Her past catches up to her, his catches up to him, and hers catches up to him.  He's sleaze but she trusts him, a little. His friends are sleaze but he trusts them, a little. The cops are sleaze, and nobody trusts them.  You weren't looking for the Great American Novel, you were looking at Hammett. It's dark, moody, and gritty, as you expected. but the right people get something in the end. It's not the finest, but it's a godd evening's read.  //wiredweir 
 The market is saturated with IT/business books and often times it's hard to spot something that in fact might be useful.  This book seems to be one of those few picks.  Without going into a 300 page narrative, the authors manage to clearly address their points and fill in the bottomless gap between sophisticated IT and business solutions. Data Mining became a hot topic only a few years ago, but it has a great future.  The earlier you get a handle on it, the better chance you have to stay on the cutting edge of business tomorrow.  "Data Mining & Business Intelligence: A Guide to Productivity" gives you basic guidelines for a smarter way to manage data in your organization.  It explains what tools you can use and teaches you the actual methods for data management.  It's a great source of information for busy people who want to make a change in their organizations as well as for students, who by reading this book, can better see the needs of today's business world 
 I was very sorry when this book ended. I felt like I had slipped into this woman's life a little bit, and I liked it.   The book was so well-written, you don't read this book - you absorb it. I can't wait to get the second one. Not just because of this author's terrific style, but because I hated to say goodbye to Lucy and Ash. 
 Who would have anticipated that a speedy card-sorter, the Hollerith machine, would evolve into a tool of one of the most evil schemes of all time?  Yet, this patented machine, devised by a little-known man of German descent, made it possible to conduct a census in a short time period, and turned counting into a tool useful on a mass scale.  Black's book is a page-burner, containing information that will surprise the reader paragraph by paragraph.  In my generation, the "Do Not Spindle, Fold, or Mutilate" written on each IBM punchcard was the introduction to the computer and information age (and often the butt of jokes).  A scant 25 to 30 years earlier, similar punch cards became the currency on which the Holocaust was based.  A truly groundbreaking piece of research that, fortunately, has already appeared in German translation.  In the days where vast amounts of personal information are being reduced to a series of ones and zeros carried electronically and stored digitally, this saga may be the harbinger of horrors much worse than were conceived by the progenitors of the 1000-year Reich.  We should pay close attention to the uses of such personal information, lest humans lose complete control of their humanity.  Here we find a true fable (that's an oxymoron) with much more to teach than Aesop could have imagined 
 I took this course via correspondence with Dr. Virkler as the instructor.  This is a superb book with very sound Bible study techniques.  It teaches the importance of literal translation- meaning: finding the author's intended meaning. The process he teaches is flexible and applies to all types of reading, although it is tailored to the study of God's Word.  The book teaches us to let go of our predisposed ideas if they conflict with what is found in Scripture.  He teaches all the tools to finding the information needed to get to the true meaning of Scripture.  If we all followed these principles, the divisions between Christians would be all-but-nonexistent 
 With this memorable memoir of World War Two, it was as if I was really there. I highly recomend this book for children of veterans, and for our honored veterans themselves. Leo C Inglesby has a way for words and I hope that he will share his gift with the public in an exciting sequel. Read this book!! 
 Only ACT prep book I used and I got a 33.  
 This is the best lit that Sartre produced.  He was one of the first "intellectuals" who I dutifully followed like I did Rock Stars once their original groups broke up:  once I found something good, I sought more and was continually disappointed.  That is not a criticism of the plays as they are here, but of the man in a wider context.    No Exit is a great masterpiece of European literature, with echoes of modernism, surrealism, and the theatre of the absurd.  I did not think it was all that deep, but it is a wodnerful theatrical experience and full of potential for later analysis.  Like the best of Brecht, the viewer is left in a state of conflict and ferment, ready to talk after the work of art is over.  Sartre's work meets this standard, and is very close to first-rate literature.    Warmly recommended as a quintessential link in leftist, existential literature.  It opened a world to me 
 Those familiar with the Criterion's laserdisc edition of _Secret Honor_ (from the early '90s) will recognize most features on this DVD release.    Even the essay by Michael Wilmington is the same.  The only truly new item here is a 2004 interview with actor Philip Baker Hall -- who is the sole onscreen actor in this film.  Hall gives a blistering, memorable performance in this film, and it's fascinating to hear how it was accomplished.  _Secret Honor_ is one of Altman's least-known movies.  It was obviously shot on a shoestring budget, but it's marvelous nonetheless: The low budget even gives the film a certain gutter charm.  Although this film (like most of the director's work during the '80s) was based on a drama, its long takes and frantic camerawork keep it from appearing stagy or contrived.  Since this film won't be everyone's cup of tea, I'd suggest you rent _Secret Honor_ before you buy 
 The newly released double disc edition of "The Towering Inferno", with its enhanced picture and sound, not to mention the additional poignancy of its parallels to 9/11, cements its place in Hollywood history as perhaps the greatest fictional disaster film ever 
 This book is a MUST-READ for everyone on the planet! I loved reading this book. It was interesting, funny and exciting to be learning so much about what make everyone tick! It was a very easy and fast read 
 Wharton is at the height of her powers here, this book affected me profoundly. I have read many of her others and while I throughly enjoyed House Of Mirth....Age of Innocence far surpassed it.  The prose and storyline has such a haunting,nostalgic and sad qaulity. Her using of Newland to protray just how much society had changed in since 1870 was masterful and done exceptionally.  The description of the way of life she records is breathtaking and at times almost unbelievable when a 21st century reader devours it. A novel not to be missed, to be savoured and read slowly 
 Pretty straightforward material on tour and insights from this terrific couple, enriching this forgotten kind of music and gently retaken by Master Ritchie Blackmore and with that marvelous voice of Candice Night. Besides that the sceneries of those nice Schlosses in Europe are really pretty good. 
 I know that the Marie Borroff translation is much praised, but this one is far better for the undergraduate classroom. While both translations share some characteristics (both are in poetry, both try to maintain the alliteration), you need only compare/contrast the "bob and wheel" (last 5 lines of each stanza) to see that Stone has managed to maintain "the sting in the tail" so typical of the original Middle English version--wherein a significant or surprising part of the stanza often appears in the bob and wheel--start with Fitt I, stanzas 4 and 7. Stone also maintains the "alliterative signaling" oral tradition: when possible he tries to alliterate only key words (Boroff seems happy when she can alliterate anything in the line, regardless of its significance to theme or motif!). As a medievalist, I am truly sorry to see so many of my colleagues jumping on the Borroff bandwagon when this superior, alternative translation is so readily available 
 This was an exciting collection and hooked my after the first episode. I am now up to the latest episode and can't wait to see what comes next. The anime is excellent quality and so are the characters. The combat is pretty awsome 
 As a High School physics teacher I appreciate a text that will convey the ideas of Physics without requiring a profound understanding of Math.  If you need a more advanced course -- take an AP course using an advanced book, like Giancoli's.  However, if all you want is a basic understanding of the concepts of physics, this is the book for you.  One important point -- a thorough understanding of this book will answer every question on the FCI (a test used by some college professors to determine their students understanding of forces in physics) 
 I love "Strangers With Candy" so when I saw that this book was written by the same people I just had to buy it. I first got it for my best friend and he thought it was crazy but goo, so I gave it a try. Great book, CRAZY, but halarious. If you like the show then this book has the same comedy style so give it a try 
 This was the perfect beginning to a great trilogy. Cameron Quinn races home to his dying father and is reunited with this brothers Ethan, Phillip and a new boy, Seth. I loved Cameron immediately and this family. The fact this family was built on love and not blood made it even more special. All were brought into the Quinn families from horrible lives and raised with love by Ray and Stella Quinn. Anna was really great. You could feel the chemistry oozing out of the pages. Fighting, loving or teaming up to help Seth; Cameron and Anna were hot. Cameron and Seth were great too. 
 Professor Litman tackles the dense and often counterintuitive basis of copyright law and delivers an easy to understand explanation of what copyright law is, what it attempts to accomplish, why it was deemed necessary, and how it came to be that copyright owners (e.g., the RIAA) are suing your teenage sons and daughters.  Criticisms of this book in previous reviews cite the fact that the book includes a number of journal articles cobbled together.  That's fine with me - the quality of these articles are such that I don't mind the occasional restating of points made in a previous chapter - these are all issues that bear repeating! I understand that the prose is necessarily awkward at times - hey! this is copyright law, it's s'posed to be opaque!  The salient issues (for me) from this book are the following:  1. Copyright law is designed, developed and negotiated by those who have the biggest stake in making the most money.  2. The US Congress, our representative to insure that we, the public, are not shafted by unfair, restrictive copyright laws, have betrayed our trust. They are swayed by lobbyists, large campaign contributions, and rubber stamp whatever the copyright owners want.  The consumer's voice (and to a great extent, the voice of emerging technologies as well!) is silent.  3. It's no longer about copying, it's about consuming.  4. The Internet (and the digital technology that accompanies it) provides copyright owners the ability to monitor, meter, enforce and control access.  Fair use is (or will be) a thing of the past; "fair use" was grudgingly accepted by copyright owners mainly because preventing copying for "personal use" was deemed "unenforcable". No longer.  We as individual consumers must make our voices heard.  Read this book - educate yourself 
 Kid's movie, but I watched it twice with my grand daughter.  The acting was quite good and the story was a fun journey with the mermaid and her adventures as a person.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone 
 This book was purchased for my 9 year old granddaughter. She was totally involved as we browsed the pages.  The colorful layout and simple explanations encouraged her to continue reading and learning.  The practice patterns for "steering" the sewing machine are an excellent idea.  The games maintained her interest and encouraged skill-building.  The easy-to-make crafts will keep her busy and make wonderful presents for her friends.  As a long time sewer and grandmother of eleven I highly recommend My First Sewing Machine Book 
 The Amazon.com review states that, "[i]n this greatly anticipated revised edition, Anderson updates and elaborates" his arguments first included in the 1991 edition and "revisits these fundamental ideas, showing how their relevance has been tested by the events of the past two decades."  These notes, especially the first part, seemed to imply that Anderson had edited the entire book, making changes throughout - and thus, that it might prove worthwhile to get the new release.    But a quick trip to my local bookstore showed me otherwise: the *only new thing* in this edition is a 23-page afterword in which Anderson, indeed, "revisits" his main themes and ruminates on the book's international impact -- on that, Amazon was right.  But they also seem to suggest other changes have been made (e.g. "updates and elaborates").  I compared numerous pages in the new and old editions at the bookshop - side by side - and found *absolutely no difference* with anything in the main text.  Page numbers and even the particular words on each line correspond perfectly.    If you're interested in owning a copy of Anderson's mini-essay on the book's success, you might want to buy the new edition.  Or, once your local town or college library gets a copy, you can drop a couple of bucks photocopying the afterword and simply slip it into your 1991 edition.  The cover art looks a bit cooler and more modern on the new release . . . but I'm not sure that's worth $20 
 A book that is listed for 12 and up, but I thoroughly enjoyed it at 42. This book was awarded the Newberry Medal in 1923. A tale of 17th English century life at sea, it is a rousing and realistic story. The author spent years researching ships logs, sailing accounts, and the life stories of many sailing men to get the proper flavor for his tale. A reviewer complained about the old fashioned language, but I think any book about a period in time does a disservice to young people by avoiding using the authentic accents, terminology, and phrasing of the time. To not do so is to rob the reader of the experience of joining the adventure and falling into the story completely. I think that classic period books that have been abridged into modern-speak to make them easier to read are simply talking down to readers and underestimating their capacity and curiosity to learn.  The plot is an adventure of a young man that has been on ships since he was a toddler, and the horrible and good people he interacts with after a horrible accident on land with a gun makes him a fugitive. He goes to the place he knows best, the sea. He joins a ship that is later seized by pirates. Forced to cooperate or die, he unwillingly joins them in operating the vessel but refuses to participate in their bloodthirsty pursuits. And there is action galore, storms, sea battles between ships, attacks on forts, sword fights, cannon fire, you name it.  The characters are interesting and multi-faceted, not gray cutouts but realistic... A woman in a tavern is kind and generous in the beginning, but as soon as she has nothing to gain for her kindness she turns on him viciously. A pirate leader is cold and cruel but points he "bears no ill will", like a mafia don stating before he kills that it is nothing personal, just business.  And many characters are not what they seem at first. Our young hero manages to survive day by day with his own cunning, and turn the dark situation to his own gain to escape, clear his name, and discover surprising things about his own ancestors. The plot switches and turns many times, always with a new surprise around the bend. A very enjoyable story, I highly recommend.  By the way, if you have a child or adult that wants to be able to look up the sailing terminology in many of the sea tales (what's a mizzen for example), or simply wants to read more books like this one, try one of the books in my recommendations  list at Amazon that has definitions and pictures for these terms, "Seafaring and Pirate books for young people", or at least try one of the following books: "A Sea of Words", or "Traditions of the Navy", Manual of Seamanship for Boys and Seamen of the Royal Navy", and "Sailing Ships at a Glance". 
 Mona Charen outlays recent U.S. social history with documented facts about the effects and results of different political approaches to crime, welfare and poverty.    A must read for anyone trying to improve their situation and values their vote as one means to help accomplish it.  The message is enlightening.       
 This was a very good book. Sometimes a bit of a slow read, but such and intriguing murder story set in anciet Rome you won't even think to put the book down! Great for everyone 
 My daughter loves this book, maybe even more than her beloved, tattered "Are You My Mother" board book.  I bet we have read this one a hundred times since Xmas!!  The illustrations are wonderful and the alphabet "rhymes" are hilarious.  I am in the process of purchasing all of PD Eastmans board books for her-I enjoy them as much as she does 
 'The Regulators' is not quite on the literary level of 'Desperation,' but that makes it more fun in a way, especially as it's less preachy.  I liked that 'The Regulators' adds a little more information about the mysterious Tak.  Here we see a more terribly playful, oddly fastidious, and possibly younger Tak who loves spaghetti, chocolate milk, westerns, and Cassie Stiles.  And while most of the characters of 'The Regulators' are flatter than those of 'Desperation,' 'The Regulators' gives us a glimpse of what some inhabitants of Desperation might have been like before Tak possessed them, particularly Audrey and Collie who were never shown "pre-Tak" in 'Desperation. 
 "The name's Cordell. I'm a drunk..."  With a begining like that I had high expectations for Gutter and the Grave and this book fulfilled all of them. When the story starts, Matt Cordell has hit rock bottom. He's gone from from being a happily married man with a thriving PI business to a  street bum. An old friend from his old neighborhood needs his help on what seems like a pathetically simple matter that turns dangerous and twisted in an instant.   Cordell is not a fun guy but he's fascinating. He doesn't want anyone's pity but he's wallowing in his own. He's a smart guy when it comes to everyone else but mention his wife's name and his brains shut down. He's a tough guy who can take a beating and give one back but he is crushed by a toss of blonde hair. He's been killing himself for years but when an innocent person needs him he pulls himself out of the gutter and goes to work. I liked Cordell, got frustrated with him and rooted for him throughout the book.   The plot of Gutter and Grave is full of turns that I never saw coming. Everyone is lying or telling just enough truth to make things murky.  McBain was brilliant when it came to the New York scenes, the side characters and especially the way he handles the murderer. Gutter and the Grave is one of the best of the Hard Case novels I've read so far. Too bad there wasn't a sequel because Cordell is definitley a character who could carry more than one book. 
 I thought the 50% discount was the best part of the deal but the DVD extras for Wild Style are just as valuable as the film itself. Cut footage of female rapper Lisa Lee should be sent to Lil' Kim when she goes to prison in September-reality check indeed. Also the graffiti and photo galleries give the other hip-hop elements center stage. 
 Thomas Paine's clear and concise writings make him one of the greatest political authors of his time. Basic thoughts of freedom and democracy, that seem so common place nowadays, were brought about because of Paines  "radical" ideas. His books Common Sense and The Rights of Man  were written not just for the political philosopher but also for the common  man. Both the aforementioned books played a big part in the American and  French Revolutions 
 Overall, this was a very good book.  Masson describes in details the lives of pigs, sheep, chickens, cows, , ducks, and goats.  He does this mostly by depicting the lives of thier wild ancestors and comparing it to how they are treated on a typical factory farm.    What I disliked about this book however, was the organization.  While I liked the chapters for the individual species, within the chapter seemed less organized.  I felt like each chapter was just one long narrative, where it could have been broken up a bit more. I also felt that this book did not talk as much about the proofs of thier emotions like he did in "When Elephants Weep."  Emotions were the main basis for becoming a vegan, or just being aware of their suffering, however he did not spend much time on "emotion stories" like I had expected.   But that being said, it was a good book.  When reading it made me think of a counterpoint or some other connection, and Masson always seemed to discuss my thinking in the next paragraph.  Read this book if you have any love for animals or are wondering why people become vegetarians/vegans 
 This has to be the most wonderful story I have read in a long time and reminds me of the Ireland my parents have spoken of while I was growning up.  I have an aunt and family in Co. Clare and I go back as often as I can.  I just ordered the book for her to be sent from Amazon.UK.   Each night I would curl up in bed and read a chapter or two and imagine I was walking beside Kevin and his pet.  What an amazing man to have accomplised that feat and it was so good to see the love and concern of the Irish people.  To bad the world has changed so much and we have to be so leery of strangers.  The people of Ireland are the most hospitable people in the world 
 This book is absolutely fascinating.  Be warned - unless you're prepared for some pretty matter-of-fact facts about humans as sexual beings, you're going to be offended by the contents of this book.  This book seeks to recognise common behaviour in both sexes, and compare it to that of the animal kingdom.  Ever wondered why we behave so strangely in a relationship?  Ever wondered why we feel what we do when we're not in a relationship.  Yet again Matt Ridley excels by teaching us popular science in the guise of a fascinating and entertaining book.  Highly highly recommended 
 You can do what you love and make money.  You can work on purpose and get the life you want.  You can work at home, be a wife, be a mom and make money.  Running a business at home is the same as running the business of a  big company.  If you think, look and act like a business, people will pay  you what you are worth.  If you believe in what you are doing, others will  believe in you too.  This book shows you the way to navigate a home-based  business, managing a family, and make money. You can create the life you  want, I did!  Kathlee 
 It's not until you are well and truly wading through the wealth of special features on the 2-disc special edition DVD of the 1947 Christmas favorite "The Miracle on 34th Street" that one realizes that the release features not just two versions of the movie, but three.  For not only does the release feature the original black & white version shown in theaters and the circa 1980s colorized version of the same feature film, but also hidden away on the second disc is the curiously titled "20th Century Fox Hour of the Stars: The Miracle on 34th Street," which turns out to be a 46 minute 1950s remake for television that is surprisingly in incredibly good quality.  The inclusion of this feature is indicative of Fox's loving tribute to this family movie gem that is this 2-disc release. Prior to its release the studio had no idea how to market what it considered to be an "unimportant program picture" and stuck it in the middle of its summer schedule with a trailer (shown here as 5-minute promotional short) that did not feature one single clip from the movie and went at lengths to conceal it's Yuletide theme.  The story is so well known that it hardly bears relating in this review. Suffice to say that it charts the efforts of a man (played in an Academy Award winning performance by British actor Edmund Gwenn) to be legally recognized as Santa Claus, which in fact he is and to persuade a doubting yung girl (played by Natalie Wood in a star-turning performance) and a practical realist (played vy Maureen O'Hara) that he is indeed Father Christmas. Picked to replace a liquor induced Santa as the Macy's Parade Santa he is a smashing success and indeed Gwenn's performance is so incredible that Natalie Wood really did believe that she was acting opposite Santa Claus.  Perhaps the best special feature in this release in what is a tough choice given its incredible comapny is the feature length audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara. Recorded at her home in Ireland this past August the DVD warns us that this is merely excerpts of that interview with frequent silent sections, but I must say that this is happily not entirely accurate. O'Hara is clearly watching the movie (discussing elements on the screen as they occur), but also is more talkative than other commentaries that I have listened to that do not have a similar warning.  In the commentary O'Hara recounts being forced to remain in the United States following the outbreak of hostilities in World War II and subsequently furious when (after being allowed to return to her native Ireland) on being ordered back to the U.S. to make this film. She tells us that other considered titles were "The Big Heart" and "It's Only Human" and how once she read the script she was determined to be involved in what she saw as a warm and affectionate movie.She also talks about the parade itself and reveals that it was the actual parade with people in the crowd not being aware that Fox was shooting a movie that day.  Also included in this release is the 22-minute "AMC Backstory" behind the scenes of the production. Including on-camera interviews with film historian Rudy Behlmer, actress Maureen O'Hara, actor Robert Hyatt (who played Thomas Mara Jr.), actor Alvin Greenman (who played Alfred), Natalie Wood biographer Suzanne Finstad and Natalie's sister Lana Wood, the documentary traces the genesis to the movie back to a fateful trip to a Los Angeles department store by screenwriter Valentine Davies. Fighting through holiday shoppers on 1944's Christmas Eve in an effort to buy a gift for his wife, Davies wondered what Santa Claud would make of the commercialism of Christmas. After working on the screenplay for over a year the project was optioned by Fox, who evidently had no idea what they had.  In what was a huge risk the filmmakers agreed, when Macy's and rival store Gimble Bros. said they would withold permission for their names to be used in the film until they had seen the finished film. Thankfully they loved it for if either store had objected Fox would have had to drastically re-cut and re-shoot major portions of the movie.  So it was that at the height of the 1946 shopping season over 100 cast and crew descended on the Macy's store in New York City to shoot interiors of the movie and when it wrapped used the likes of Rex Harrison and Anne Baxter (who were on the Fox lot shooting other pictures) to rave about the production. Fox need not have worried though because it was a critical and commercial success staying in theaters for over six months and taking home three of its nominated four Oscars. In fact its popularity is such that it has not only been remade in the included 1950s TV production, but again in a 1970s TV movie and then in a 1994 big budget production (and clips from all three are featured in the AMC Backstory).  An archival MovieTone News reel (running 1:42) covers those awards presentations and includes the famous quite from a clean shaven Gwenn when receiving his statue, "Phew. Now I know there is a Santa Claus."  But that's not all this bumper release contains. Also included is a 15:30 featurette on the history of the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and in particular its pivotal role in the movie. This new documentary features on-camera interviews with Robert M. Grippo (author of a book on the parade) and John W. Straus who worked on the parade for 22 years and coordinated with thr studio that the filming of the parade (with their 14 camera's positioned along the route) went off without a hitch.  The special features are rounded out with nine posters for the movie.  Audio includes English 5.1 Dolby Surround, English mono, French mono and Spanish mono. There are English and Spanish subtitles 
 Wow, excellent book!!!  I have had four German shepherds altogether, (now currently three), and I was able to find very helpful information inside this book.  I don't know how I've been without it all these years.  Of course, it won't replace a veterinarian; however, it does give you a heads-up on what is going on & what a possible remedy would be.  So far, it's been very accurate 
 This is a gem of a book. Anybody who wishes to learn about people-management and human behaviour cannot afford to miss this 58 page booklet. The cover design and the booksize is mighty deceptive - this you will realize when you get to know the amount of wisdom that is treasured between the covers. 
 Steven Raichlen is the guru of ribs.  The recipes in this book, along with the rib recipes in his other BBQ and Grilling books are fun, easy and uniformly delicious.  If you enjoy the experience of ribs you are in for a treat.  
 I HAVE JUST FINISHED READING THE NARRATIVE OF DAVID CROCKETT FOR AN AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS AND HAVE TO DO A SHORT THREE PAGE PAPER ON THE BOOK.  I WAS HOPING TO GET SOME IDEAS ON THE INTERNET TO HELP OUT WITH THE PAPER,  AND SAW THIS LINK.  THE BOOK WAS GREAT, EASY READING, AND INTERESTING TO  THE READER, MYSELF.  HOPE YOU ALL ENJOYED IT AS WELL AS I DID 
 This bag is great to keep just the necessities and it will hold all your stuff (water, wallet, cell phone & keys) plus your babies.  The material is crunchy and noisy but does not make noise while walking only when reaching in and getting something 
 It's the gifted individual who can make math fun: it takes a complete master to do the same with Godel's Theorem.    Godel, Escher, Bach was first recommended to me by my piano accompanist three years ago.  I flipped through it--it looked too bizarre and eclectic to bother with.  Three years later, when I finally did start reading it, I couldn't put it down.    Hofstadter is entertaining, fascinating, earnest, and--above all--unbelievably clever.  The puns littered throughout, the triple-decker meanings, the symphonic weaving of the work is enchanting from start to finish.  I can't imagine anyone not gaining something from this book, not seeing the world differently after it was finished.  Logic seems different to me, music different, truth and math and reality different.  And there are moments of just the purest wonder within, moments when I felt almost hyponotized, ready to find out that I was a character within somebody else's book, maybe a Djinn or a God Over one.    I admit that even in this easily digestible presentation, I couldn't fully understand the Godelian proof--though I grokked the gist of it.  It's no matter though--there's so much within here that I won't spell it out or explicate it, only point out that it is what is claims to be: a synthesis of the three titular men, a work of gold 
 This is a great book for people who are looking for a job or switching careers. It has tough interview questions that you can use to prepare-this alone is worth the buy 
 A Perfect Red is history at its best:  examine something seemingly insignificant, let it take you down its byways and tangents to myriad interconnections, and soon you have a world history in miniature.  A Perfect Red is primarily concerned with the age old desire for bright colors, especially red.  In the 16th century Europeans discovered a new source from the Americas which would provide a beautiful shade of dark crimson: cochineal. Over the next several centuries cochineal became one of the most prized imports from the New World until chemical dyes became commonplace in the 19th and 20th centuries.  Amy Butler Greenfield writes well, not just about cochineal and its uses, but about the economics and politics behind the search for the perfect red.  She also does a good job examining the cultural changes which made red highly desireable, then a color to be avoided as a symbol of sin and decadence.  Furthermore, she is a skilled depictor of personalities and draws shrewd portraits of the many fascinating characters involved in the story of cochineal.  Highly recommended.  
 Flay never disappoints.  I've made a lot of the recipes, they are incredibl 
 I had to write something after I saw a couple bad reviews here from people who obviously identify Cook/Fatboy with a very narrow genre, but if you like this artist not for some genre he fits into, but for his endless creativity and the fun he jams into his funk, BUY THIS CD.  I can see how some people can't handle everything going on here, from a tribute to original reggae dubmaster King Tubby, to funkmaster James Brown, to "roll the dice" a precursor to the acid beats of "better living thru chemistry", to obscure 60's French synth-rock of Jean Jacques Perry, to Steve Miller (!)... Cook makes it all work and he makes it all his own 
 I picked up the Vicar of Nibbleswick when I was 19, delighted that I had found a Roald Dahl book that I had never read before.  This is a very fun book _for anyone_!  If you have children or teach, this is a wonderful way to make reading pure fun.  The book is not long, packed with humor, and tells a thoroughly silly tale.  Also, considering the book is all about a dyslexic vicar, it is a wonderful book to share with a dyslexic child, not to mention any classroom with a dyslexic child in it.  Roald Dahl has a way of making the fantastic part of children's lives.  For your children or classroom, I also highly recommend the BFG (Big Friendly Giant) and Matilda, both by Roald Dahl and both as creative and imaginative as can be 
 There is a disclaimer on this set that warns that the material presented in this dvd may not meet the educational needs of today's children. My advice is to IGNORE this ridiculous warning. The material presented on this dvd is some of the best work Sesame Street ever produced. Sure some of its dated, but what a perfect opportunity to talk to your kids about history,culture, and all sorts of things.  I really loved this DVD. It brought back many happy memories of watching the show and I was surprised as to how many skits I remembered. This is a definate Muppet must -have,along with the Muppet Show,Christmas Eve on Sesame Street,Muppet Family Christmas, and the first three Muppet movies 
 Sea Lab is often a hit and miss show.  This DVD is no different from the ones that came before it.  There are many funny, worthwhile bits in this season.  If for no other reason than to round out your "Captain Murphy Years" collection, this DVD is a reasonable purchase.  Also note that many of the episodes featuring the new captain are, contrary to some of the reviews, enjoyable.  Overall, this DVD is a worthwhile purchase 
 CIA agent Roger Seagraves has opened up a gun for hire business.  He calmly assassinates the Speaker of the House the Honorable Robert Bradley.  For obvious reasons he has shaken the country and put fear into the hearts of the DC leadership especially chicken hawks used to others dying on their behalf, but to Roger it is one less "bloody politician".  The four wacky Camel Club members (the leader with no past named Oliver Stone, a rare books expert at the Library of Congress, a former Jeopardy champion, and a former Defense Intelligence operative) begin investigating the homicide.  Due to their connection to the Library of Congress, they quickly link the Congressman's death to that of the Library's Rare Book Collection Director.  As the sleuths struggle with uncovering and stooping the killer, con artist Annabelle Conroy sets in motion a scheme to scam thirty-three million from Atlantic City casino owner Jerry Bagger.  As Annabelle and her crew succeed in their con, she has to follow-up in DC where she meets the Camel Club who unofficially makes her a member as the quintet search for a killer who knows his or her way inside the corridors of government.  The sequel to the madcap CAMEL CLUB centers more on the killer and the con artist than the dysfunctional behavior of the quartet.  The two subplots are filled with action that never slows down, but the tying of them into one story line seems overly extended lacking probability.  Still fans of David Baldacci will enjoy THE COLLECTORS as the cat and mouse battle with Seagraves augmented by the addition of a female into the miscreant male group makes for a fine suspense thriller.

 It's obvious from the long list of reviews that purists will quibble over which tracks from which artists represent their quintessential 80ness. But us ordinary folks, who just want a cross-section of the playlist from the alternate radio station we listened to in the 80s, won't care nearly as much. If you like a particular artist from this selection (and there are 82, so you probably do), you probably have several albums by that band or performer. I know I do.  Where this collection of songs shines -- and it does shine -- is in making you feel like you turned on the radio on a very good day. For every artist whose stuff I own (REM, The Pogues, They Might Be Giants, Kate Bush) there were three who made me say, "Oh wow, I hadn't even thought of that band in ages!" The Jesus & Mary Chain? Husker Du? Wall of Voodoo? In some cases, the tracks reminded me why I was willing to forget them, but that's what you get from any anthology.  Personally, if I had a long car ride coming up, I'll grab this set of four CDs and bring 'em along. I don't think I'd be bored for a moment 
 I think if you give a listen to "Sympathy for the Devil" and "Jig-Saw Puzzle" both songs with a story, both over six minutes long, you'll hear the influence of Bob Dylan and that's a good thing, I think, the way the Mick and the boys have melded Dylan with the blues. Music that rocks, lyrics that make a difference. I know there are folks out there who will say I'm an idiot for even mentioning the fact that Dylan influenced the song writing of Mick and Keith, but come on, "There's twenty-thousand grandmas, waving their hankies in the air, burning up their pensions saying it's not fair." That's a Dylan influenced line if ever I heard one and that's a good think. Dylan started rock with meaning, Mick and Keith took it to a whole `nother level and I only have one thing to say about that, "Bravo! 
 My playing group is fast approaching epic levels, but their weapons are still boring.  I had begun to create exceptional weapons (and gear) that they could take with them over the 20 mark, but it was a slow process to map out how the items would increase in power as the characters did.  This book goes into the many steps and details for creating artifacts (as opposed to magical items).  It was just what I needed.  It helped me balance the power with some drawbacks without making my players feel like I was stealing all the thunder of their new weapon.  Written in the style of the core books and other supplements, the Wizards team clearly explains the rules for exceptional items.  I have begun using it to create the items for which my players will search and fight in the next several adventures.   In fact, the retrieval (or creation) of these items can be a module in and of itself.  Well worth buying 
 What I like most about the writtings of Mr. Leon Metz is how he tells of what is said to have happened, what may possibly have happened and what probably did happen. As any old west buff knows, truth was not always a top priority and many stories were blown so out of proportion that the truth may never be known. Mr. Metz uses research along with common sense and comes up with truely believable aspects of this notorious outlaw who was clearly the greatest gunfighter of his time. This is an excellent book by an excellent author about the old west's most dangerous man

 Will moving to New York change Sammy Granger's life forever? Sammy is a young girl, straight out of high school. Who has moved away from her friends and family to follow her dreams of becoming a fashion designer. But does the young Minnesota girl know what the big city has in store for her? 	 Sammy has arrived at New York and has found a place to stay for a couple of days. But to find out she has to find a place sooner, because of a terrible tragedy that has happened. Then she finds an apartment to share with this model (Rain). Then Sammy gets a job, with this really hot boss who she starts to date. But later on Sammy will come to find out that he is not all he is cut out to be. This will take Sammy on a new and exciting journey.  It is through this tragedy that leads Sammy on a journey for a new job. This job is not at all what Sammy, or her family had in mind. Will Sammy's new job allow her to follow her dreams of becoming a fashion designer? Sometimes life throws us a lot of curve balls. But Nancy Krulik gives us a chance to see how hard life can be in New York. But she also shows us that we should not give up, just because some people are crooks.  This book is great for high school students because it shows them how important choices are. Because if you don't know what you want than people are going to take advantage of you, when you get to be an adult, and live out on your own. I also think this is a good book because it targets a big variety of people.  
 Very nice shoe, right size and very comfortable.  The strap is nice and the big buckle gives an interesting touch.    
 Finishing Becca is a historical fiction novel about a girl living during the American Revolutionary War.  Becca Syng is a 14 year old girl sent to be the personal maid of Peggy Shippen, a spoiled Quaker daughter who just happens to be the most beautiful girl in all of Philadelphia.  She is sent to be finished by her mother, but Becca learns much more than French, art and crewel work.   What I liked most about this book was Ann Rinaldi's ability to capture what was going on in the mind of an American colonist; and a teenager no less. Rinaldi bottled Becca's opinions, ideas, and thoughts about what her country and her country's soldiers were going through.  There wasn't much to dislike about this book. Some scenes put very graphic pictures in your mind, but other than that this book is great.  My favorite character in this book is Becca because she and I share some of the same characteristics. Becca is always curious and always wondering about the world around her.  Just like me.  	The scene that I thought was the most moving was when Becca helps one of the Shippen girls with one of her missions.  This book is different to me because it is a historical fiction, but it is also suspense-mysteryish along with a touch of comedy.  If you read this book, you will be entertained and you will learn at the same time.  If  I could go back in time, the questions that I would ask are: Did Peggy Shippen really turn Arnold against his country?  Was Mr. Shippen really all that neutral?  Was Peggy really that horrible?  I strongly recommend this book because you can learn about all the bad stuff that went on behind the lines on both sides.  This book is really worth reading.   
 The Hicks, Hicks and Mole book is well written and represents with a good degree of accuracy the Five Element material taught to students of J. R. Worsley who studied at his College of Traditional Acupuncture in Royal Leamington Spa, England.  This style of acupuncture was taught to students with consistent content for over 20 years.  The authors have expanded the material in terms of background information from the Chinese Classics and have included at the end of the book some material which integrates the Five Element System with TCM principles; but the Five Element material remains true to Dr. Worsley's teachings at least up until he left the College in 1994.  The book is well worth reading by all practitioners interested in the body, mind and spirit care of their patients, not least by those of us who now miss contact with Dr. Worsley's gifted influence.

 Typical Danielle Steel fluff, but one of her better books. A little of everything: love, betrayal, tragedy, and hope. 
 An exciting book perfect for older kids.A fast-paced and a quick book perfect for anyone to read.Acceleration is a book that will keep you at the edge-of your seat.This is a type  of book that will make you feel like you are actually in the book itself.A great book that I recomend to everyone 
 The "rule" of Lorenzo "the Magnificent" Medici in Florence was always fraught with danger. He was not a king or a high elected official, but he effectively controlled the city during his lifetime. This book details just one of the plots against him, and the one that came the closest to killing him and changing the government of the city. It failed, but Lorenzo's brother was murdered, and the revenge taken against the plotters and their helpers and members of their families was brutal indeed, even by the standards of a much more brutal age. The book is riveting when it talks of the plot and its aftermath, but there are long stretches about Renaissance banking and such that are just mind-numbing. These stretches are what kept me from giving this work 5 stars. Otherwise, it is an excellent read, and I recommend it 
 I loved this book!  It gives great insight on the next huge industry and ways that entrepreneurs can cash in.  If you're looking for a great business idea or information on how the world will change, get this book.  You won't be disappointed.  I was surprised at the negative reviews.  I'm thinking that those people probably can't read.  This is a great book 
 "This is the most complete book I've seen about the development of roads in the United States. The American Highway also has great histories and photos of gasoline retailers like Mobil and Phillips 66, early roadside restaurants such as Dairy Queen, A & W and Stuckey's, and motels (Holiday Inn, TraveLodge, etc.). Hundreds of historical photos, from the pinoeer days, modern-day turnpikes, up to the interstates. It's a must-have book for anyone interesting in highway travel. I would highly recommend this book."  Dr jeff thompso 
 this edition was larger and nicer in quality than i expected.  definitely one for the permanent collection.  perfect as a gift for a friend's new baby named "harold" (i know, go figure).    
 I especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms. My only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen.  It has a contrast adjustment, but it not very helpful.  It also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either. A great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast.  
 This review is in response to another reviewer's comments that this book, 1937 copyright edition, is not any different than the later 1952 copyright edition republished by Golf Digest, and, that it is a beginners book and one needs to go further than the techniques and principles advocated by Jones in order to develop a sound golf swing.  Said reviewer needs to go back and read both books again.  Although the 1937 edition adequately describes the Jones' theory and is recommended, the 1952 edition is a rewrite which incorporates the results of another 15 years of instruction experience by Jones.  A discerning reader will find it to be better organized and more thorough, particulary the chapter on obstacles to the swing.  As far as the reviewer's comments that one needs to go further, this person has missed the whole point of the Jones' technique.  When I was first introduced to "Swing the Clubheas" I was told that "if it is not in there, you don't need to know it."  Today, more than 20 years later, I teach via the Jones' method and can say that if one truly applies oneself, all that needs be done in the swing will be done; you need do nothing else but "swing the clubhead."  A true understanding of the technique, however, is not obtained by a casual reading of the book and an impotent effort to understand and apply the idea; it requires some time and a sincere effort.  Fine wine is not produced by crushing some grapes and dumping them into a vat for ten minutes.  It takes time to mature.  The Jones' technique is infallible and complete if diligently applied, and, if it is not in there, you truly don't need to know it 
 Director -and ex-cinematographer- Zhang Yimou infuses a simple tale of lust with beautiful visuals and a strong sense of foreboding.  Hazy yellows, midnight blues and strong reds alternate to create an overwhelming sense of melancholy and desire in this tale of a servant (Li Baotian) who falls for his sadistic master's slave wife Ju Dou (Gong Li).   The film recalls silent cinema's use of tints while at the same time creating a languid editing cadence totally at odds with Hollywood technique, and succeeds in creating a bucolic tragedy which boils over with desire and death. Ju Dou was banned in China on release, because it was seen as focusing on the persistence of feudalism in modern (post-1948) China.  Although this issue is not immediately apparent to Western viewers, the film is seen as a key work of the Chinese Fifth Generation directors, and is a great example of an aesthetic in Chinese cinema which blends the personal with the political comment in a distinctively rural environment.  Yimou's subsequent work has not really lived up to this and the other films he made in the 1980s, as he has veered onto big-budget works such as "House Of Flying Daggers", which unapologetically aim for international audiences. 
 To my surprise this isn't her debut. Her sophomore album is nothing short of being "ethereal" in sound, kinda like Loreena McKennit's "The Mask and the Mirror", and Layla Kaylif's "Enough Rope" (w/c aint available there in the US heheh) although not to the exact strategem (I definitely recommend them along). Hailing from Canada, with her background of coming from a family of Wiccans-turned BornAgain Christian- surely tis the stuff that could held up some intrigue like that of Alanis Morrisette- although not as pretensious or phony-ish like Jewel. Her single from this album "If I Fall" is totally moving enough to kill me. My tape copy ending without the bonus hidden (untitled) tract explains me title here 
  	The geopolitical landscape evolves so fast that almost any book about global politics ages before the ink can dry. Zbigniew Brzezinski - known as one of the keenest students of American defense and diplomacy since his service in the Carter administration - urges European-American rapprochement over Iraq. He calls for a transition from a war against terrorism to a moral war for global equality and political representation, namely, democracy. No doubt due to unfortunate timing, his book does not account for recent democratic elections in the Middle East or for new transatlantic diplomatic initiatives. Regardless, he uses his laser-beam intellect to show convincingly how globalism, American geopolitical dominance and American cultural imperialism are interacting to create a perfect storm of misunderstanding that leaves Uncle Sam with a tough choice: how to react to terrorism without overreacting and causing U.S. isolation. He concludes that America can choose to lead or to dominate, but not both. We strongly recommend this book to students of globalism and the ongoing experiment of global democracy 
 The Good Home is a Great Book!  More than that it is a motivating book.  You're probably thinking how does a book about architecture do this.  This book gets the reader to think about what the architect and author, Dennis Wedlick, is explaining then motivates the reader to expand on it.  You like his concepts and the thinking behind them yet he's telling you to take it further.  He's an expert who provokes not imposes a concept and then lets the reader take it higher.  Mr. Wedlick includes beautiful photographs of his finished products that mesmerize the reader and beg you to read on.  I highly recommend this book as both a learning tool and a new way to approach your idea of how to live 
 The service and delivery time were good and so was my experience with this order 
 Prior to the twentieth century, the thought of an undiscovered civilization in Africa was still believable. These books, based on that premise, are fabulous escapist literature. Haggard milked the concept for all it was worth, and thoughts of hidden diamond mines and the existence of a mysterious female ruler fueled his novels. Escape with Haggard and imagine untouched civilizations probed by unknowing explorers.  
 After having had the Back To Basics Beginners Meeting shared with me after several years of contented sobriety, I was excited to have found a perfect guide to help people in sharing the message of AA.This is a perfect tool to guide the sponsor/sponsee relationship in the direction needed to not only introduce the 12 steps but also to re-inforce the principles of AA in all our affairs. The response from not only new members but also those with various degrees of continuous sobriety has been beyond my wildest expectations and show a definite hunger in the members of AA for a duplicateable program of recovery commited to the foundations of our program of "taking the steps" not just talking about them. 
 I read F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Tender is the Night" (1934) following a recent online discussion on Amazon's discussion board in which a number of good Amazon reviewers offered their thoughts on the book.  I am please to note many fine reviews on this site as well.  "Tender is the Night" is a story of part of America's "Lost Generation" in the period following WW I.  Most of the story is set on the French Riviera in the 1920s with a large cast of wealthy, dissipated and idle Americans with little to do with themselves. The book tells of the fall of Dick Diver, a promising and idealistic young American psychiatrist.  As an intern in Zurich, Dick had married a beautiful wealthy young American woman, Nichole Warren, who had been his patient. Nichole had severe and lasting psychiatric issues resulting from sexual abuse by her father.  While on the Riviera, several years into the marriage, Dick is attracted to a callow 18-year old American movie actress, Rosemary Hoyt.  Although he resists Rosemary's advances at the time, her memory stays with him. She and Dick have a brief affair a few years later.  Dick ultimately sees her as shallow.  By that time, his life has dissipated through drink, idleness, problems with Nichole, and the corrupting effect of Nichole's money. Nichole leaves Dick, and he returns to the States for a lonely, wasted life.  It is all very sad.  I found the story effectively organized and told. The opening scenes take place on the French Riviera with Dick seemingly at the height of his powers as a socialite and budding medical writer.  After an extended opening, the story doubles back to Dick's life in Zurich and has fateful courtship of Nichole.  We then witness Dick Diver's inexorable deterioration, alcoholism, and degeneracy, and the break-up of his marriage.  The writing is eloquent and spare, with good characterizations of mostly unappealing people and pictures of places.  We see the rootlessness of a class of Americans after the great War and the corrupting effects of money and idleness.  Dick Diver's story, I thought was sad and sentimental rather than tragic.  There is little of the hero about him.  "Tender is the Night" is the story of wandering lives, lost innocence, and the waste of human potential.  In some ways, the book reminded me of the writings of the Beats, following WW II.  It is a 20th Century American book, well worth knowing.     Robin Friedma 
 Card's greatest gift is to create suspense from moral dilema.  He is also very good at battle field planning.  This book has a good measure of both. Ther storyline of this book is interesting and well crafted.  It is not nescessary to have read the earlier books in the series to enjoy.  Of particular note is his argument for having children.  Well worth the read.    casl 
 We bought this for our daughter's 3rd birthday and she loves it. It is very easy for her to ride. She is a tall 3 year old and this tricycle is a perfect size for her, not too high like most bicycles. Great for the money and a fun ride 
 Contrary to the previous reviewers belief, I enjoyed this book much more than I have any other Ann Rinaldi books 
 This is one of the best instrumental CDs i have ever heard.  Bryan Sutton sets the new standard in flatpicking 
 Puzo really takes you back to pre-war "Hells Kitchen".  His descriptions are vivid and engaging.  Like many of his other books,  this one is about family.  The reader is shown a struggling mother and her children over a 20 year period.  The two female characters (mother and oldest daughter) are truly heroic.  It is by their there virtue and perseverance thatt this family can stay together and ultimately prosper. They are the rock that their family and this story are built upon.  Its a testament of how stong women can pull a family up by its bootstraps despite the failings of the men.  Puzo's use of Italian (proper, dialect and slang) brings the characters close to home for those readers of Italian-American decent.  The vartious Italian-American characters brought back memories of long since past members of my own family.    This book really places your in 1920s-30s new york with all its splendor, virtues, vices and difficulties.  It showed me what life was like for my grandparents, aunts and uncles.  This was a very good book that I will read again someday. 
 Prime tuna fillets seasoned perfectly and presented attractively instead of like cat food 
 Book arrived first of the three ordered at the same time.  Book was in excellent condition 
 If you like quality writing, this is it! Mr. Wolfe is extremely talented at painting an entire scene with words that leave you feeling like you are there. Character, scene, and plot development all have depth. And I'll have to disagree with an earlier review that said the characters weren't believable. They were entirely "human" with all the rich exceptions that make a person who he or she is. I also disagree with the comment that the book, itself, was racist. No, the book wasn't, but some of the characters were, which was a point that Mr. Wolfe was attempting to make about them because their racism had to do with the larger story. I will most definitely read Mr. Wolfe again because of his extraordinary writing abilities. That said, I was completely disappointed with the ending, both because of specifically how he chose to end it and because of its weakness. The ending lacked the full-bodied development that Mr. Wolfe gave to the rest of the story 
 This set of CDs is one of the best ways to be exposed to new music in the punk rock, pop punk, emo, punk, and alternative genres. Drive-Thru managed to get all sorts of bands on these CD's, with a grand total of 145 songs. It's hard to imagine that much music all at once, in fact I haven't yet listened to all of it. So far so good! :)  There is just so much here to listen to... buy this set if you've got a lot of time on your hands!  The music itself is worth a 5/5, you'll definately find stuff that you'll enjoy for a long time. Better yet, you'll find whole new artists you can look into for more great stuff!  The real issue that I have with this compilation is organization. The MP3 portions of the CDs are as poorly organized as a 13 year old's bedroom!  The names of the files are in the form: XXYYYY.MP3, where XX is the track number and YYYY are four letters of the title. It's nearly impossible to tell what song you're playing! The ID3 tags, the things that Winamp uses to get more information about the song (title/artist/cd/year/etc) are all very very messy. Many misspellings on the first CD, most of the artist names are in the "album" placeholder, and the artist comes up as "no Artist". Very many are just plain labelled incorrectly. It's ridiculous!  I used the paper insert to rename them all to their correct names, that took me easily over an hour!  Oh, and to top it off, track #49 on CD1 is just plain missing.  Drive-Thru Records: shame on you!  The music, however, deserves a 5/5. So much variety, so many songs, you're bound to find at least a CD's worth that you really like!  Hope all that helps.. 
 This book is the easiest, fasted way I have found to get rid of emotional baggage.  All you do is press areas of your body with your finger(s) and the negative enery begins to lessen.  The more you do, the better life becomes 
  I bought a copy of "Karma" on June 5, 2002 during a relatively austere rainy day in St. Louis and never expected the album to be the entrancing trip that it has turned out to be. While certainly aware that it came out years before then, "Karma" was a new experience for me. The album's 11 tracks are absolutely spellbinding with it's mix of beauty, mystery and austerity throughout. The cover perfectly portrays the mood of the album. "Window to Your Soul" is a 9 and a half minute epic with two parts. The first part of the track is spooky, creepy and very unsettling. In the break between the two parts it reaches a strange uncertainty and morphs into a gorgeous sunnier sounding track like as of the sun shining after a severe storm. "Til The End of Time" brings the CD to a gorgeous close and is probably the most mainstream track on the album. Highly recommended CD. 
 In the name of King Geedorah! This album is sweet. Metal Fingers' smooth beats, excellent rhymes from all guests and DOOM/Geedorah himself.   My only beef is with "No Snakes Alive," I'm not feeling the temporary increased tempo that occassionally occurs through the song.   Best songs:  #1 Fazers #5 Monster Zero #6 Next Levels #8 Anti-Matter #10 Lockjaw #11 I Wonder #13 The Fine Prin 
 Boy was this a good idea for Barry! Big band music seems to have faded, at least for the most part. His renditions of these great old songs is a classic. 'Moonlight Serenade' and 'Apple Blossom Time' are my favorites here, but I honestly like all of them. This was music when the words carried meaning and the voice and instruments echoed those messages. Les Brown, Jimmy Dorsey, Glenn Miller and Harry James... how could you go wrong? They play it straight, which is the best to do when giving old music new life.  All I can say is.... wow! This one's a keeper 
 The collaborative effort of Karen Witynski and Joe P. Carr (joint owners of Texture Antiques, an Austin, Texas-based interior design firm and gallery specializing in hacienda style, Mexican colonial furniture and architectural elements), The New Hacienda is an eye-opening source book of interior design showcasing ideas drawn from Mexico's remote country estates. Full-color photography and raptly descriptive text combine to present the flavor and history of homes on both sides of the border. An impression-forming and memorable showcase spotlighting deep brown and yellow colors, and artifacts of Mexican culture. Also very highly recommended is the Karen Witynski and Joe P. Carr collaboration, Mexican Country Styl 
 Knight Templar 1120-1312, by Helen Nicholson is, like most of the books in the Osprey Warrior series, well-written and copiously illustrated.    Although only 64 pages in length, the greatest value of the book is its several photographs and illustrations allowing the reader to get a good `picture' of what Templar life was like.    The book is divided into the following chapters:  Introduction Chronology Recruitment and Admission Belief and Belonging Training Appearance and Equipment Living Conditions: On Campaign Experience of Battle Museums and Re-Enactment Glossary Bibliography Color Plate Commentaries Index   "Knight Templar 1120-1312" is a good introduction to the historical Knights Templar for those unaware of their history and a fair quick reference for those with a deeper background.    The book lacks any of the claims of Templar mysticism or its ties to Freemasonry, and remains focused on established history.  If you enjoy reading about the Knights Templar, than this book is definitely a worthwhile addition to your library. 
 I haven't cooked a single recipe from this book, but I have learned more from it than from every other book on cooking I have read in the last ten years. It is that good. Every chapter packed full of tips, hints, and the important stuff - e.g. fennel works with this, oregano doesn't, don't put brandy in a marinade, and so on and so on. And every one of those hints and tips has lead me to a better meal. Buy in bulk and mail them to every person you know who thinks about what they cook and can read.  
 My daughter picked up a Lab/bulldog mix puppy thrown out at a park. His health is not the best to say the least. While searching for  a non-steroid solution to his skin allergy rash, I stumbled across references to Ms. Levy's book. This  book, along with another by Pitcairn have saved this puppy from dying. An added benefit has been that my Cocker and Dachshund have improved as well. The Cocker is now 13 years old and I had accepted her slowing down and lethatgy to her age. Now that she is eating naturally she has energy that I haven't seen in years. The nicest effect is that she no longer smells horrible and her eyes no longer water and leave stains under her eyes! The book is written so that it is easy for anyone to understand. I am highly recommending this book to all. I think it should be required reading for veterinary students as well 
 Gary Foster, a long-time Los Angeles studio musician, is also a jazz heavyweight.  Throughout "Make Your Own Fun", Foster demonstrates not only his mastery of the saxophone (and alto flute) but his prolific  understanding of the jazz idiom.  Each solo that Foster crafts is a  tasteful example of this.  Joined on this disc by an allstar cast of West  Coast jazz musicians Pianist Jimmy Rowles, Bassist John Herd and Drummer  Joe Labarbera 
 As will become clear later in this review, I have a considerably negative view of hyper-preterism and not just because I think it's unbiblical.  It is a movement that has gained cyberspace traction over the last number of years now and in my view, represents the worst of what can happen when internet sites are considered to be equally viable in terms of their information and credibility.  This book is a compilation of essays from a mostly Reformed perspective written by a variety of scholars.  As such, some essays are better than others, and the reader should expect to find disagreement between the contributors on matters of eschatology.  By far the best contribution in this book is delivered by Hill.  A person without an in-depth knowledge of eschatology nonetheless has the ability to ask a rather basic but telling question where full preterism is concerned - if Jesus' Second and final Coming occurred in 70 AD, and we are now supposedly living in the new heavens and new earth, why is it that no document we know of written by any Christian around this time ever recognized that such an apolocalyptic event took place?  Is it reasonable to think that a small and mostly undistinguished group of people 2,000 years later have identified what nobody at the time knew about and the historic Christian church for 2,000 years has been unaware of?  According to full preterism, the answer is a resounding 'yes'.  Hill tackles this question with meticulous scholarship and documentation, coupled with painfully probing questions about how such a view could possibly make any sense to anyone.  Hill is especially qualified to deal with this subject matter, as he is widely recognized as one of the best conservative patristic scholars around, and his work on the Johannine Corpus in particular is considered first rate.  Nobody on the full preterist side even remotely possesses the credentials in this area that Hill does, and it shows in his essay.  It is simply a devastating critique.  Kistemaker's contribution is also outstanding.  His essay is a truncated version of his award-winning commentary on the Book of Revelation, and I think it is decisively persuasive in debunking the creative interpretations of the full preterist folks.  Strimple's contribution is also quite good I thought.  Pratt's contribution is good, but could have been better, because while laying out a fairly good approach to how to deal with Old Testament prophecy, he falls a bit short in actually critiquing the full preterist approach on this question.  He gets into this a little bit, but not sufficiently in my view.  As such, his essay struck me as being a bit incomplete.  I'm giving the book 4 stars because the partial preterist contributions in here could have stood for considerable improvement.  The first major essay in the book is Gentry's essay on creedal orthodoxy.  For many full preterists, this is where the rubber meets the road.  They know their view does not conform to the ecumenical creeds of the church, so they not only have to deny the creeds themselves, but they have to find a way to argue that any Christian who places any creedance in the creeds is actually denying Sola Scriptura and basing their Christianity on human tradition.  Gentry in particular has been in the crosshairs of a number of online articles written by full preterists.  Gentry's essay attempts a response, but it was clear that he had succumbed to taking the whole thing a bit personally, and where systematic argument and sober analysis would have hit the spot, the reader will instead find a lot of back and forth accusations that don't really address the serious questions at issue here.  Mathison probably would have been a better pick to tackle the 'denial of Sola Scriptura' question than Gentry.  Further, as I will mention below, the book's look at full preterism is not penetrating as it could and should have been in other areas as well.  In the end, I recommend this book as a mostly effective antidote to full preterism.  In my view, full preterism presents us with a revealing object lesson about what happens when eschatology is conducted in isolation - isolation from the Christian church as a whole throughout its history, and isolation from other areas of theology.  Full preterism, by definition, has no Biblically based ecclesiology, and no Biblically based pneumatology.  If the Christian church has been dead wrong for the last 2,000 years about the central event in the consummation of all history, what kind of doctrine of the church are we left with?  If the church has been wrong for its entire history on this question, what are we to say of the ability of the Holy Spirit to preserve his church and lead it in truth and righteousness?  Full preterism, by logical deduction, cannot affirm anything of the kind.  In order to preserve its eschatological imperatives, full preterism places itself in the dubious position of necessarily arguing for an impotent (rather than omnipotent) Holy Spirit, and for a church that does not have Christ as its cornerstone.  Full preterism ought to scare the death out of Christians who believe in the power of the Holy Spirit (as Scripture teaches over and over again) and believe that the church truly is the Bride of Christ and the primary instrument of bringing God's Kingdom to the ends of the earth (which Scripture teaches repeatedly).  Not only can full preterism not affirm these things, but they have to attack everyone (and I do mean everyone) who does.  As a rule, whenever a Christian hears some person or some movement proclaim that they've discovered something essential to true Christianity that the Christian church hasn't known about or has been wrong about for 2,000 years, that should immediately make us suspicious - because anybody can make that claim.  When we further discover that these individuals are coarse and fiercely divisive, are not seminary trained, have difficulty getting published, and exercise enormously irresponsible scholarship to bolster their views, that really ought to seal the deal.  Well, this is a nutshell of the full preterist movement.  Nothing more really needs to be said, in my view 
 I thought this was a real page turner.  It was chalk full of forensics details that made the tense action very real to me.  The action was smart and full of unpredictable surprises.  At the same time, Dr. Scarpetta is a very human and likeable character, and the book has quite a bit of deep emotion in addition to the fast action 
 I've always admired Robin Williams' design books. They're straight forward, practical, and well layed out, of course. What's important about Robin's books is that she consistently ties together several design principals and builds and connects to those principles in each of her books. She provides numerous examples and resources for you to build upon and she makes you feel that you can achieve the goals of good design. Her books are not written from an elitist or esoteric point of view. They're written for both design students and laymen who are interested in the principles of good and effective design 
 I bought this book for my eight year old daughter, but haven't given it to her yet. It is definitely appropriate for young girls, as it explains the changes to expect (for girls only) during puberty but does not go into reproduction and other mature details, which I believe would be more appropriate for older girls. It is written in an age-appropriate tone and encourages girls to take care of their bodies, reassures that their feelings are normal, etc. I do wish it did not have quite as much detail about the use of feminine products, which is why I haven't given it to her just yet, but overall it is the perfect book for young ladies who are just beginning to "need to know. 
 If you're into Seal, I'd recommend this collection to ya'. It's well rounded and an easy listen 
 What I found most memorable in this book is the connections it makes between the personal and public, the objective and subjective, and the natural and supernatural realms.  It can be read as an extremely important analysis of racial politics, and the politics of disenfranchisement.  I read it as an ingenious account of how a person becomes a ghost, impressive because  the story presents a profound and serious examination of the process of how this happens.  My grandmother used to say that, "There is no black magic.  There is jealosy."  Wide Sargasso Sea reminded me of my grandmother's saying because it also exposes the "witchcraft", the black magic people practice every day without knowing it, through petty emotions that give rise to bad intentions and manifest in evil acts.  Wide Sargasso Sea is a story of how jealosy, hate, and pride can kill people, and still do.  It is also the story of the spiritual effects of such "witchery."  Wide Sargasso Sea is also a story of love, rather than a "love story."  In our society, we like to think it's love when an affair works out and ends up in marriage and children.  When it doesn't work out, we like to say that it is not love, and we call it co-dependency, obsession, and a host of other terms from psychology.  I believe that Wide Sargasso Sea poses the controversial argument that when love goes bad, it's still love--that love can be a hideously negative thing.  Poor Antoinette, the heroine, binds herself to a man whom she knows hates her--categorically--because she is a creole--and being unable to break off from him she damns herself and ends up becoming a ghost in her husband's cold English house.  At least, that is my reading of the finale.  I was also impressed by the face-off between two of the central characters--Christophine, an Obeahwoman (witch) and the Rochester character who is not so named in the book.  When they face each other about Antoinette and Christophine tries to get him to leave her and part of the fortune--in his mind he comes up with hateful and racist arguments and perspectives on Christophine.  In the end, Christophine, for all her Obeah powers, cannot defeat the racist hatred of Rochester.  And his intention all along was to take Antoinette to England and lock her up in his attic--a prisoner and a dirty secret he would never show to anyone.  Yet another instance in the story showcasing the witchery, the black magic, of our petty human emotions 
 The thought of hiring someone to help in the house brought up a swirling mixture of emotions, making it hard to logically decide if household help was right for me. Besides covering all the how-to issues of placing ads, interviewing, training, and paying taxes, in her book Kathy helps readers sort out the emotional side of deciding to hire household help. In summation, if we are willing to buy a meal from a fast food chain that pays its workers a bit above minimum wage, why not pay someone to cook a meal for us in our own kitchen (at a higher hourly wage)? Ditto for paying for laundry services, a grocery store that picks out our food, or a babysitter to watch the kids while we do chores. Because I am a married woman without kids, I initially decided to hire a cleaning service to come once a month instead of hiring my own part-time employee. But when my husband ruptured his Achilles' tendon, leading to three successive casts and rehabilitation, my work activities as a self-employed writer and real estate investor came to a crashing halt. Much of my time was spent doing his share of the chores plus taking care of his new needs. I reread Kathy's book, placed an ad in the local college newspaper, and received three calls a day until I canceled the ad early (I decided it was worth it to offer $11 per hour to get the best applicants I could afford). The mature student I hired has worked in the past for a cleaning service, is more of a neatnik than I am, and is a talented cook! Even after my husband's leg heals, I suspect we are going to continue hiring part-time help. It is absolutely wonderful to leave my computer and walk upstairs into a clean house with fresh baked cookies cooling on the counter! For us, it is worth it to economize in other areas (our newest car is 8 years old) in order to afford household help. I'm glad Kathy wrote this book because it helped us make a decision that worked for us 
 This practice weapon handles very well and feels comfortable in my hands. Its weight in my hands is very comfortable. And I am able to execute all my movements easily with it.  It is worth the price of purchase 
 All of E. T. 's books are down to earth, real and not-often talked about subjects such as incest, bed bugs and what it's really like to be in the U.S. armed services 
 Hiaasen's career got started with this excellent novel filled with macabre humor, characters, motivations, and observations on life in retiree-rich Florida.  The idea of scaring off tourists by hunting them down is just sane enough to make the whole book believable, and the supporting characters' quirks help make up for the protagonist's boring personality.   An excellent crime novel which reads like Elmore Leonard on LSD 
 Mr. Cahill describes the surrounding environment of Jesus. What the apostles must have thought of him, what the apostles were like, what mary magdeline was like. This is an interesting approach, most realistic, not spirtual, idolizing or religious of Jesus of Nazareth.  The part about the Shroud of Turin is fascinating because it describes how there was no way for this peice of cloth to have been faked because the  technology was not around at the time to have done that 
 As an educator (retired), I got an advance copy of this book. My first reaction was, "This is everyday math?!" Then in the third chapter it hit me: This is not necessarily what everyone knows (if that was the case, there would be no need for the book). It's what every American adult should know by the time they graduate from high school. Sadly, given the state of math education in this country, this book probably should have the subtitle "in an Ideal World." I recommend that anyone who wants to really understand math, and not just rush through it as some sort of evil necessity, study this book thoroughly -- after, or in addition to, their high school courses. And don't fret the abstract stuff. Math is abstract by its very nature 
 This is a subtle and brilliant analysis of the way that archaeology has been conscripted into the project of Israeli colonialism.  It shows how archaeological sites and practices have helped to remake the modern landscape in ways that construct a highly politicized, essentialized, and exclusionary vision of identity rooted in place.  It represents an exceptionally fine example of the conjuncture of Anthropology and Science Studies, and it is one of the very best treatments of the politics of archaeology known to me.  It will, of course, be quite troubling to those who believe in the Zionist political project, as it exposes the artificiality of many of the claims that archaeology has been used to construct and naturalize (hence the inevitable negative reviews by political opponents).  But the work is not at all polemical, and its thoughtful, measured analysis should be appreciated by most readers.  It certainly demands to be read by anyone with a serious interest in the politics of the Middle East, colonialism and postcolonial studies, the history and sociology of archaeology, or science studies in general.  It should be mandatory reading for university syllabi dealing with these issues 
 I had a hard time finding dishes for someone under 3 years of age.  these were perfect for a 2 year old.  she really enjoys them, and loves making "soup Hot" for her daddy. it includes pots and pans and little a spatula and serving spoon so she learns how to use these things. It helps with dexterit 
 This was an intense, beautiful, seductive, romantic read so why not 5 stars - I just could not figure out why these two, Brianna and Michael kept holding back completely from each other and why after many crisis the last one changed them and allowed them to be true to their feelings.  They just seemed so intensely in love almost from the beginning.  There was so much in Michael's background that kept him from showing his true depth of love for Brianna but he did love her almost from the first moment they met. It seemed there was not enough explained about why Michael held back - and once they finally get to England - why no big scene with his mother?  Brianna was such a hoyden - so totally independent and challenged him at every turn. It was so obvious that she was head over heals for Michael when they married - so why the challenge of the need to be courted after their voyage to England??  Even though I felt a tiny part of this book was not quite explained - overall there was so much to these two characters to make for one of the finer new releases for 2004 and I would highly recommend this awesome romantic read by Melody Thomas!! 
  This item is really good if you own a Leappad and some of their books. It holds the Leappad itself, about 15 of the books and it even has spaces for the cartridges. The only thing I wish is if it had more space for people who have a lot of the Leappad books 
 I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.  I really wish Amazon Unbox would allow me to burn shows I've purchased. As it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer. When Unbox expands this service to allow me to burn DVDs I will likely purchase many more shows this way. I like selecting individual shows 
 before buying used, consider the author's own web site & other major bookstores - the book is available new for a very reasonable price 
 This is without a doubt the most concise and yet thorough and thoughtful systematic theology that is available.  It begins and ends in the correct places, and has careful argumentation of the Reformed Christian faith.    The only complaint that I have is the binding.  It is absolutely awful.  I do not know what the publisher was thinking.  The reader can hardly read the entire page because the book is so difficult to lay flat.  The book almost seems to be spring-loaded it is so tight, and closes so quickly - watch your fingers.  I would suggest finding an older copy from another publisher.  The Banner of Truth edition is easier to read 
 I was fortunate enough to know Bonnie Nardi when I worked for AT&T. I read her book and enjoyed it. She is an anthropologist and this book explains how humans deal with technology. Might be a little advanced for some, but give it a try 
 Transgressions  provides  readers with the opportunity to sample ten different offerings from ten different authors.  There is a gritty 87th Precinct novella from Ed Mcbain and a lyrical offering on a child abduction from Joyce Carol Oates.  Steven King is well represented with a short but strangely moving tale of a 911 survivor haunted by his souveniers from his unlucky co-workers.    I enjoyed Transgressions for both its quality and variety. While no story in particular was a stand out, each provided a sample of the particular author's style.  Like a buffet, a taste is really all you need to determine where (and whether) you will return for second and third helpings 
 This is an incredibly important book. It is a clear and systemetic discussion of the beginnings of ethology by one of its founders. Too bad it is out of print. I really hope the publisher makes it available via print on demand technology so I can have a private copy 
 As a career counselor, my clients often ask me a lot of questions about interview techniques.  This book answers all of them, from how to dress, how to act, how to respond to difficult questions, how to address gaps or  other problems in your work history, and so much more.  This is the best  guide I have come across for such information, and I consistently recommend  it to my clients who want to cover all of their bases 
 Excellent book, well researched and very well written.  Accurately portrays the events that lead to Eastern's demise.  I am no fan of unions.  But, Lorenzo displayed a blatant calloused disregard for Eastern, it's people, and everything connected with it 
 I've been enjoying learning about influential scientists lately, and this was a good resource in my self-education.  It was really well made, combining standard documentary techniques with reenactments of episodes from Galileo's life, making for a program that's very informative and also easy to watch.  I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the history of science 
 My daughter has only gone through 1/3 of this book but I have to say I am pleased so far.  Learning to read comes very easy to her with this book and it is easy for me to use as well teaching her.  You can't beat the price.  I know there are more expensive reading programs out there but they all do the same thing.  It's a matter of putting in the time and effort.  I would suggest this book to anyone that wanted to teach their child to read 
 I love this backpack. My daughter is in preschool and she loves cabbage patch kids. I bought her a Dora backpack at the beginning of the school year and the zipper broke. A little girl in her class had this backpack, so of course my daugher had to have it. So I searched around and found it!! It is very durable and easy to clean. My daughter likes that it has wheels and that she can wear it like a backpack. It has alot of room inside about the same room as a childs suitcase. It is perfect to hold her art work and library book! Hope this review helps!!!  
 I would highly recommend this for anyone who is considering the commission of Jesus to journey together in life.  Lupton, by simply retelling his own urban experiences, relays profound insights about living the Christian life, and especially practicing ministry.  It is helpful when thinking about urban ministry, but would apply to any setting.  
 Cool, tasteful, and great music from one of the masters. Un-Feat like, but no worse for that - just different, but still with the touch of genius. Buy, open the bottle pour a glass, sit down and listen. You will enjoy 
 I had to read "Great Expectations" for an English class last year, and I was not a huge fan of that novel. But "Bleak House" is a hundred times better, and I'm glad that I didn't allow "Great Expectations" put me off to Dickens.  Admittedly, "Bleak House" starts off a bit slow, and the narrative (particularly the 3rd person present tense half) was a bit tedious in parts, but overall it's excellent. About halfway through it began to really draw me in.  It's a huge novel, but don't let that put you off. By the end you'll be sorry it wasn't a little longer than it is. It made me cry in places, but in others it made me laugh and smile. And Dickens's colorful language is captivating 
 This movie was made back in the 80's but the special effects continue to leave me mystified. The cinematography is spectacular and is only second to the brilliant acting and directing. If you haven't seen this movie, you don't know how good movies can be. Buy this now because they just don't make movies like this anymore and you'll never see anything like it again.   By the way, if you're a fan of Garbage Pail Kids, you definately won't be dissapointed by this portrayal. They're as cool, if not cooler than you could imagine them yourself 
 After reading the very positive reveiws of this late 90's thriller I decided that it deserved at least a rental. I must confess that I am glad that I happened to stumble upon this movie on Amazon because it was everything that a horror movie should be. The Screenplay was very put together, the plot & setting were intriguing yet mysterious & the killings (Or cinematography if you want to make it sound all fancy) & visuals are quite impressive for it's 500,000$ dollar budget. Now, the only real complaint that I can say about the film is that the acting is horrid. Now dont get me wrong not ALL of the acting was that bad but I would be lying if I said that most of the actors were okay, the truth is that most of them had very little experience and THAT made the film look all-around quite a bit less professional and hard to look at as an ELITE horror film. I think that if the producers would have known when they made the film that it would do so well and have such great reveiws and number of veiwers than they would have been more than willing to dish out the few extra bucks in order to have some more experienced actors.   I thought that David Hewlett played David Worth (The Architect) acceptably and I also thought that Nicky Guadagni's performance as Helen Halloway (the Doctor) was pretty good. Other than those two I thought that the acting was very lightweight. The guy that played Quentin (the cop) was really bad which was quite a shame just because that characte had a big role in the film and was really important ... also I thought that they could have gotten a better and more experienced guy to play the role of the Autistic boy (or man it was some what hard to tell...).   I know that I keep going on and on about the acting but I cant wonder away from the truth to much. The concept and idea of the film was really quite brilliant, the screnplay was brilliantly written and the story line meshed with extrodinary ease. Despite the acting I was heavily impressed and the film was Overall very good.  Grade: B+      
 This book was quite eye opening.  It takes billions of years of evolution and tracks it at the microscopic level (hence the title).  After reading it, you have to take another look at all the different forms of life here on our planet.  I am very glad I bought this book and look forward to reading more from both of these authors 
 Quite possibly one of the best recordings by Weather Report because of the addition of Jaco Pastorious who added new dimensions to "Heavy Weather". Jaco played the bass like many jazz musicians play the sax, following the lines but delving into improvisational bliss. His style defied defintion but suffice to say he was a master at his trade and a trail blazer; too bad his time ended much to soon to fully explore his depth of soul. The opening track, "Birdland," is very different from other versions you may have heard because of the fine arrangements by Joe Zawinul. Zawinul lulls his audience in with his expertise as he floats from acoustic to electric piano then over to sythnisizer while you sit in amazement at the textures of overlaping sounds. Many of the songs are mellow with Wayne Shorter contributing  just enough to highlight his sax in contrast to Jaco's bass underlying the rhythm that can break into a solo at any moment. The term world music can apply to this synthesis of sounds on "Heavy Weather" that has jazz-rock elements. For example,the song "Rumba Mama" is a pefect early lesson in the merging of cultural sounds with heavy percussion and eclectic diverse sounds integrating into one cohesive piece of music. The voluminous textures are a thing of beauty. This is indeed spacial Heavy Weather and should not be missed this time around 
 One of the best Harry Bosch novels that I have read.  It will keep you second-guessing who the actual suspect was till the end.  Like the inside of dust-jacket cover says "Just when Harry thinks he's on firm ground, the bottom falls out."  That's what the novel is.  You won't be disappointed.   
 Buy this book, whoever you are, if you are at all interested in television, visual culture, and electronic media.  It's guaranteed to get you thinking, and it's quite likely going to change your opinions about the simplistic ways TV gets talked about by academics and non-academics alike.  Take pleasure in the fact that this is one of the most lucidly written academic titles out there, but doesn't dumb down its analysis; McCarthy addresses her reader carefully, respectfully, and without a tad of the vapid academic insiderism exhibited in the Newport Beach reviewer's unexplained and to my mind inexplicable response to the book.  Plus it's loaded with wonderfully illustrative photos and line drawings.  A real treat 
 Recorded after Ring Wars and before Mare Vitalis. This is a transitional record that explains alot of how they developed the more raw melodic feel of Mare Vitalis from the raw atmosphere of Ring Wars. This is a short but sweet record, Appleseed Cast fans need only apply here. Their are some very interesting riffs that only AC could come up with, and some realy great vocals from chris. The only thing is their are two tracks that sound like alot of statis with SOME (very little) melody in them, I don't know why you'd release a record and slow it down with subtle instrumental tracks, but that's sorta been their thing (especially in LLO). It's still better than most records but by no means is it a complete album. It's a great gift to fans who crave more music from this very talented band. Look for a new release this year, and if your new to them check out Ring Wars, Mare Vitalis, and their masterpiece Low Level Owl I & II 
 This unique collection of short stories, all of which are based in a small and colorful Portsmouth tavern, is a fabulous read.  Excellent characters,  pure enjoyment layered upon tales of the sea, famous events and battles and  a lot of witty and rich dialog.  Dr. Dogbody's salty and humorous martime  stories capture both the people and events of the time.  Dogbody is a  mixture of Harry Flashman, Forest Gump and Long John Silver.  The  supporting cast of characters is suberb, all carefully written to interface  with Dogbody's amazing tales relating to the loss of his missing apendage.   I'd love to see the BBC present ten episodes of this book.  A clever and  unique reading adventure. If you enjoy the Forester, Kent, Pope, Fraser or  O'Brian's novels, you'll find this and keep it on you bookshelf and point  it out to your literary companions with a chuckle 
 Luke Slater, however, is usually known for his aggressive four to the floor techno. Madonna fan's nearly strung him up by his ankles after turning her ballad the Power of Goodbye to a pounding industrial techno stomper.  It was shocking to fans, critics and DJ's alike that Slater decided to make a pop album. A lot of people don't like this album, but I think its enjoyable. Artists always take it on the chin for changing musical directions, or "underground artists" trying pop. I think its brave.   Luke Slater's sonic barrage of beats is still there, but is also an homage to early 80s synth pop.Traditional verse chorus song structures, along with New Order basslines and Erasure synth arpeggios rub up against 4/4 techno, and broken breakbeats.  As much as it is Slater album, it could also be a solo effort by Ricky Barrow. Soulful, gravely but also cool, his vocals give these songs an above the Brittany-Justin pop edge   Nothing At All takes those trade mark Slater beat assaults and tames them with pop sensibility, Thomas Dolby synths, and Barrow's slightly soulful vocal.   You Know What I Mean is a midtempo number that crackles with sexy electronic burts of energy then errupts into a big New Wave chorus.   Stars and Heroes is the crowning single of Alright on Top, and is great homage to early 80s synthpop, but with a modern 21st century feel. Bouncy synth bass, arcade noises(i thought my cell phone was going off...it was actually the song) and analog synth pads cushion Barrows best vocal delivery on the record.   I Can Complete You is full on retro 80s action, with a completely vocoded vocal. Only mediocre.   Only You thankfully picks up the pace again with some amazing breakbeat drum programming and scratch work by Slater, and a great vocal performance by Barrow, along with some deep bass and 80s synth lines. A nod to New Order comes at the end with some very Bernard Sumner-esque guitar work.   Take Us Apart Is like Erasure on speed...a bad batch of it.Follows the formula of I Can Complete you, but works much better as hyper synth pop with a heavier 4/4 beat.   Searchin For A Dream Follows Only You with more great breakbeat/big beat work and taking a break from the retro-lectro action.   Take Me Round Again is much more typical Slater sonic techno barrage but this time with vocals by Barrow.   Doctor of Divinity is more typical Slater like techno with its Beltram like beats and electronic crackles of noise on top of more subdued 80s influences   Alright On Top doesnt bring any huge innovations to electronic music. But if you try not to live in Luke Slaters past and accept it as it is, its a good electropop record 
 Great photography (reminded me of the Third Man - studied angles, perfect use of BW) and 1950's sets. The script is somewhat unbelievable and loose and the actors second rate, but who cares 
 As much as one would prefer complete cycle recordings, very few pianists find so much afinity with a single composer as to offer a compelling account of a complete cycle.  Gilels or Richter never played Beethoven complete sonata cycles, Ashkenazy's Chopin cycle is full of great performances as the ballades and others were he seems to fall out of the love with the music as in the polonaises.  So the point being that rarely can a pianist do justice to complete sets, why is it that i am giving a 5 star rating to this set?  Well, to me it seems that Kempff had all the ideal atributes for Schubert playing as are solid technique and expansive rhythms, concentration in touch and a singing line, but most important is that you feel all throughout these recordings that he loves every detail of the music.  Simply put, it seems that he was enjoying himself here and all details considered, his Schubert playing is perfectly balanced.  Get it - soundwise Uchida's and Schiff's cycles have now the advantages of modern recordings, but both of them lack the heart Kempff has bestowed here 
 One of my favorite shows ever.  Season 4 is just as good as the first 3, but the kids are starting to grow up.  Only one more year for John Boy and Grandpa after this.  Season 5 will probably be the last season I'll buy.  
 I like to think of Bernard Williams' book as an extended argument for virtue theory in general.  He doesn't tell us what virtues to have.  He doesn't set up an ethical system to follow, and he doesn't present a theory in any positive sense.  In this way, he gets to have all the power!  For it is easier to write critical remarks and find flaws in other peoples theories, but it is more difficult to advance a theory of one's own and defend it.  In a strong handed sort of way he advocates his own theory by destroying all others!  One might call his method: having a good defense by having a good offense!  I thought his scholarship was good.  He has a sound handle on his few references to Nietzsche (all but one were positive).  I'm no Kant or Aristotle specialist, so I can't comment there.  He also comments on contract theory and relativism.  In one spot, he actually decided not to map out Kant's argument and instead he made up a mock argument that was supposed to be analogous to Kant's.  So he shows a sensitivity to good scholarship, and instead of misstating the views of the great philosophers, he would rather approximate or tell us that he is (roughly) saying what they say.  He notes often where he is not so sure of his interpretation of other thinkers, but takes his interpretation as being stand alone and uses it to get him to the points he wants to make.  That said, however, Williams has a compelling way of critiquing ethical theories.  He also did this in his excellent introductory book called "Morality."  In that book he gives the sort of criticisms of theories like utilitarianism that hit the mark, whereas the typical ethical class seems to give uninteresting arguments.  For example, he says that utilitarians tend to accept traditional values and merely make their calculation calculus fit their views.  On those credentials I got the present book.  I hated the first chapter.  The second chapter was a little better, and then the rest of the book (esp. chapter 8) was very intellectually stimulating and more like the thoughtful Bernard that I remembered from the earlier book.  If you're like me and you hate to hear gospel according to Bernard, then skip the first chapter!  But the rest is very interesting.  What I got excited about:  (1) His analysis of the limits of ethical reflection (or philosophizing, as one might say).  He claims that our knowledge of ethical items drops to zero when we consider ethical items stripped of their first person specific content (p. 148).  He identifies knowledge Nozick style, which is to define knowledge as true + belief + truth-tracking (as his justification).  I believe he argues something like this: that with much ethical reflection, comes much responsibility -- none of which repays its loans.  I always thought this was just obvious, but Bernard spends a lot of energy on it as if a lot of ethical philosophers disagree with him (I guess that's why I hate ethics classes and loved the present book!).  (2) Ethical considerations are fundamentally different than scientific facts.  Science corresponds to an external reality and ethical things do not.  But that doesn't mean ethics lacks objectivity.  Bernard believes that there are levels of objectivity.  He also believes that types of ethical facts do indeed exist.  Ethical facts, that he thinks we are warranted in asserting, are dispositions, i.e., they are what virtue theorists talk about.  Ethical dispositions, supposedly, can be known by us in the first person sense.  Thus he believes that ethical facts exist, but whenever we theorize about those facts our knowledge drops to zero.  (3) He believes that the ancient Greeks had ethics right (basically, but with a few amendments) and that we have it wrong.  We emphasize systems of morality that involve rule-making, contracts, etc., and none of those alternatives gives us insight into the really interesting ethical questions.  (4) He thinks we have no reason to make moral rules at all.  Ethical theories that are based on moral rules come under sharp criticism.  "We are concerned with what any given person, however powerful or effective he may be, should reasonably do as a rational agent, and this is not the same thing as what he would reasonably do if he were a rational agent and no more. (p. 63)"  In short, he argues that hypothetical cases or systems of rules do not take into account of enough of what makes us humans, falling into obscurity and lacking any objective correspondence to reality.  No single set of virtue dispositions are THE ONES above and beyond any others.  However, cultural relativism doesn't follow.  We internalize our ethical considerations and so it is false to say that we should do as Romans do, for example.  (5) But he believes cultural relativists have a kernel of truth.  If we were to think of ethics according to his virtue theory alternative, then we might be less judgmental about past cultures and we may not be as dogmatic about preserving our present ethical practices for all time.  "To our immediate successors, our children at least, we have reason to try to transmit more: it is a mark of our having ethical values that we aim to reproduce them.  But this does not affect very determinately what remoter generations will hold. (p. 173)"  So ethical dispositions change over time...DUH!  I wish more philosophers would think like Bernard!  It would make ethics classes more enjoyable.  Other ethics books come off as if they were written by aliens from other planets.  The Rachel's book, for instance, boldly assumes that there is no difference moral facts and scientific facts.  What planet is he from?  What magic argument did he forget to tell us about?  Has anyone opened a paper and read about a new moral discovery?  I haven't.  At least Bernard is sensitive to these issues.  He is great for those of us who like to read ethics without getting all yucky!  I don't actually have many criticisms.  I already said I hated the first chapter.  Yes, it really is horrible.  He sets out to define ethics and he takes a lot of premises as givens.  He hates egoism for some reason, and he is very blunt about it too.  Maybe he ran into one of those horrible Objectivists (who go around giving egoism a bad name).  But here are a few things I didn't like:  (1) He is totally uninterested in any arguments for or against the distinction between "ought" and "is".  In fact, he scoffs at it as if its of no interest at all.  I don't see how it isn't of interest.  (2) He accepts many, many premises as obvious.  But it should be noted that many top-notch philosophers write this way too.  Jerry Fodor, for example, does the same thing.  But it's still annoying!  It should noted, though, that his arguments don't largely depend on these assumptions.  His assumptions mainly put constraints on his reasoning as a starting place.  Don't worry, he has plenty of deductively valid arguments!  (3) He's a bad writer, period.  (4) Every once in awhile he will make a subtle distinction and then say in parentheses: (and they are not the same).  These always leave me scratching my head, "huh!".  See, p. 93.  I highly recommend it!   
 I had the pleasure of meeting Hill Harper at the Delta Sigma Theta National Convention in July. As both a teacher and a counselor, I was so pleased to see Hill Harper take on the challenge educating our male youth population. After reading the book, I must say that my expectations were not just met but greatly exceeded. Not only does this book have a permanent place on my reference shelf, I will be writing a grant to purchase copies of the book for each graduating 8th grade student at my school. The information on avoiding the common pitfalls of life is so vital.  In today's society where manhood is measured by such materialistic and superficial means, it was quite satifying to see the "old school approach" of taking care of business translated in a way that even the youth of today can appreciate. I am so looking forward to seeing great things happen in my school as my young male students get the quality of advice that could only come from someone truly caring, compassionate, and concerned with their plight 
 Tomas Kulka has provided a comprehensive review of Kitsch with his 3 conditions: 1 - Kitsch as highly charged with stock emtions; 2 - that which is immediately identifiable; 3 - of no enrichment and associations to depicted themes and objects. They are not exhastive by themselves of course, but do help us in 'understanding' Kitsch better as its definition has often been too vague and broad notwithstanding its often negative aspects. Kitsch in fact is such an overwhelming 'product' of capitalism and consumerism which plays a central role on our life now. Especially in postmodern time today where demarcation of high art and low art has become insignificant, as such Kitsch as negative and bad taste art has become redundant. Or, there are more negative and worse art around now than Kitsch!  Kitsch as of not much artistic and aesthetic values is illustrated analytically by Kulka. However, the analysis could be more effective with more comparisons of 'fine high art' as with 'Kitsch art'. More examples of Kitsch art could be quoted.  I find the applications of Kitsch to other forms of arts such as music and architecture redundant. More could be talked about on aspect of Kitsch with Pop Art instead. Their relation would be more immediate and directly relevant especially in postmodern time now.  Kitsch is definitely becoming more relevant to us as we are becming more capitalistic and globalised with mass pop culture. Its phenomenon is rampantly identical across continents! A globalised Kitsch is set to 'conquer' us, may it be in postmodern time now or thereafter. 
 This collected volume, which leads up to the incredible finale of the Preacher series, finds Tulip leaving her new life of booze, drugs, and Cassidy to try to get her life back together.  After that (and a rousing backstory on Tulip's childhood and her meeting with Amy), she and Jesse are re-united proving one of Preacher's many themes: love is stronger than death.  The best parts of All Hell's A-Coming is undoubtadly Jesse learning all of Cassidy's dark and dirty past.  This part is pivotal for a few reasons: longtime fans of the series have no doubt grown to love Cass, and now their opinions will be surely changed.  Also, this is the plot progressing set up the final, pivotal events that come in the next and final collected volume; Alamo.  The final story, a backstory on one of Jesse, Tulip, and Amy's criminal misadventures, isn't one of Ennis' better written stories, but think of it as an added bonus 
 I love this duvet cover.  I didn't think my down comforter could be any more comfortable, and I bought the cover simply to keep it clean.  I didn't realize that it could make my bed so much more comfortable!  It is very soft and a great addition 
 it's based a lot on his previous book.  I don't like feeling like I've purchased the same book twice.  Overall, a good read & helpful to my marriage 
 Complaints seem to abound in regard to how this Schaum's outline is too theoretical and has too few problems involving applications. You must remember that this particular outline was meant to complement an undergraduate mathematics course in complex variables, not an applied physics or engineering course using complex variables. Thus, the purpose of this book is to develop the calculus of functions of a complex variable.  This is one of those Schaum's outlines that has sufficient explanation, figures, and examples that it can double as a cheap textbook on the subject. However, remember that the emphasis is on theorems and proofs of theorems versus applications. However, there are some sections of the outline that are excellent at illustrating some applications of the subject matter. In particular, chapter 9, "Physical Applications of Conformal Mapping" contains applications from physics using those equations that are defined by a potential, including the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field, and, in fluid dynamics, potential flow, which is an approximation to fluid flow assuming constant density, zero viscosity, and irrotational flow. By choosing an appropriate mapping, the outline demonstrates clearly how one can transform the inconvenient geometry of one set of these equations into a much more convenient one. The equations are solved in this new "convenient" geometry, and then transformed back into the old one. One example of a fluid dynamic application of a conformal map that is detailed is the Joukowsky transform.  If you are not looking for a book to complement a mathematics course on complex variables and you are looking for something more applied, you might look at "Complex Variables: Introduction and Applications". That book has the first part dedicated to theory and the second part dedicated to applications at a reasonable price. 
 The only reason this misses the 5th star is the "trick" to opening the canister - you have to catch the lid above the raised circle around the canister.  Easy enough once you know the trick, and the canisters seem to seal nicely.  They're attractive and durable (yes, mine have been dropped on the odd occasion with no issues!).  I would not recommend this product for someone with arthritis, though.  A very nice set overall... Polder impresses!  
 Published in 1957, "The Rise of the Novel" was immediately recognized as a landmark of literary criticism. It has, justifiably, retained this status up to the present.  Recognizing that life does not present itself in neat separate packages of literature, history, and sociology, "The Rise of the Novel" integrates Watt's considerable knowledge in each of these areas to assess the impact of three authors, Defoe, Richardson and Fielding, upon the development of the English novel in the eighteenth century. In the final chapter, he shows how their contributions were integrated and further developed in the works of Laurence Sterne, Jane Austen and others.  Along the way, he makes numerous fascinating observations that I personally had not run across before. For example:  *	With the rise of the city (in this case, London) in the eighteenth century, and the resulting development of a more transient population, the model for the Family shifted from the patriarchal family (with a paterfamilias) to a conjugal model (i.e., a new family is born upon each new marriage).  *	During the century, there was considerable disapproval of the heroic epic (as exemplified by Homer) as a result of the manners and morals it exhibited, i.e., violence and cruelty. "Tom Jones," a comic epic, was critized at the time for glorifying these and other negative values.  *	The large number of "spinsters" during the century led to formal proposals for the passage of laws allowing bigamy.  The book is remarkably fair and balanced in its assessment of Defoe, Richardson and Fielding, with Richardson coming off better than I had expected. It's not enough to make me want to read "Pamela" and "Clarissa," but I did come away with a heightened appreciation of Richardson's abilities as an observer of life and society.  Watt's own life (1917 -1999) is interesting. He joined the British Army at the age of 22 and served with distinction in World War II as an army lieutenant in the infantry from 1939 to 1946. He was wounded in the battle for Singapore in January 1942 and listed as "missing, presumed killed in action." In fact, he was taken prisoner by the Japanese and remained a prisoner of war until 1945, working on the construction of a railway that crossed Thailand  a feat that inspired the Pierre Boulle novel "Bridge Over the River Kwai" and the film version by David Lean. More than 12,000 prisoners died during the building of the railroad, most of them from disease, and Watt was critically ill from malnutrition for several years.  He joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1964., and was chair of the English department from 1968 to 1971. In addition to "The Rise of the Novel," he is best known for his body of criticism of the works of Joseph Conrad. 
 If you appreciate movies that "rank" as So-Bad-They're-Good, this book is a MUST. Razzie creator Wilson names his 100 favorite amusingly awful movies, listing cast and credits, original (often hilariously vicious) reviews for each, as well as a pithy essay on what makes each one such fun to watch. For once, someone has written a bad movie book that's about enjoying bad movies, as opposed to just trashing them. For titles available on DVD, Wilson even gives "Choice Chapter Stops," for those who can't wait to go straight to the crux of each clunker's most laughable low-lights. At the back of the book, there's a listing of where and how to buy, rent and/or catch on cable the 100 films listed -- As well as a complete history of The Razzies' first 24 years. Anyone who loves laughing at bad movies will love this book 
 I am a begginer runner and I have really enjoyed this book.  I can see why it's a best seller.  It has been a great place to start on my way to getting into shape.  The author is very thourough in the material he covers.  He is very enthusiastic about running wich inspired me to get moving.  
 The key to this book is in the title"assist and adjust", not "correct". This is the basis for the great response I have received from my students since receiving this book. I have been teaching for four years, but I have been very cautious with hands-on adjustments, being a male with primarily female students.They have all expressed a noticeable difference, since I can make correct adjustments with confidence. I use this book on a regular basis when planning class schedules. It has helped me to take my classes to the next level 
 Greg Tang gives us one more fantastic book.  You will want to share this book with your "thinkers."  I use this book with my fifth graders to help foster mental math skills.  Tang teaches us how to look at groups of objects in an organized kind of way, and to add the objects quickly and efficiently.  My son who is in kindergarten loves to look at the pictures, and challenges himself to add the objects.  We have lots of fun 
 Funnier than Lords and Ladies, we also get some Igor. The vampires are done well; these are modern vampires ("vampyres,") and there is a reason they tend to resemble Marilyn Manson wannabees. The pixies are great, the young priest is great, and the pop-horror and pop-horror-parody references come thick and fast. Granny Weatherwax features in this one and saves the day as usual, but it isn't quite clear exactly how (she has a talent for "borrowing" in which she can leave her body and take over animals, but in this case she apparently puts a bit of herself into a number of different people; this is a bit too "magical" for my taste, and seems to violate the spirit of Discworld, where magic is real, but has specific limits and constraints). If you don't care about consistency, though, this is not a bad choice 
 release and I am glad I did.  It is a really nice Mozart collection.  In fact, I purchased this disc along with Garanca's Mozart disc on Virgin the same week and I have to say that they are two of the best Mozart programs I have purchased.  Kozena's voice sounds great (as always) and her ornaments are unexpected but nice.  I can't remember the last time I enjoyed "Voi che sapete" so much.  The orchestra led by Rattle is wonderful as well.  However, the one who really shines through this disc is Mozart.  
 With all the documentaries out there today, it's sometimes easy to forget the expression "The Joy of Music".  Thankfully, Mr. Clark stays away from trying to overanalyze every note and decision, and at times delights in the instantaneous, spur of the moment happenings that create great hits. (ie.,How the song Hold On, I'm Coming by Sam & Dave was written in about 30 minutes by Isaac Hayes!  Will never hear that song the same way again.)  Each chapter is devoted to one particular studio, and some of the giants who recorded there, what gave the studio that particular sound, but more often than not, what accidental happening's created the soundtrack to so many of our lives.  With each studio covered in only a chapter, there are probably  thousand's of untold stories that go along with each studio, however once again Mr. Clark hits on the highlights, and does a good job of figuring out what the reader really wants to know.  After reading a chapter, found myself pulling out various cd's of the respective studio's and enjoying them all over again.  
 this book is a lifetime movie if one was ever written. great plot and character 
 I use my Cruzer Mini constantly at work.  It's great for quick data transfers, small utilities, drivers or patching systems that are off the network.  It's slim and lightweight enough that I tend to drop it in my shirt pocket and forget about it.  You probably see where this is going...but yes, it's been run through the washing machine at least four times.  What may be even more impressive is that it's been run through the dryer three times (once I did catch it after being washed and saved it from the dryer, allowing it to air dry instead).  It still works as well as the day I took it out of the package, never missing a beat 
 "The Wood Wife" won the world fantasy award for a good reason - it meshes magical realism, faerie myths and the artwork of Brian Froud in a strong tale of old favourites - love, loss, friendship and sacrifice.  Poet Davis Cooper leaves all his posessions to a long time penfriend he has never met. She journeys into his life, slowly unraveling his story, encountering his creations and gathering awareness of the desert's secrets around her. Characterisations and descriptions are original and vivid, enhancing the mental imagery available to the reader. Recommended 
 The first time I saw this film was back in high school, over 20 years ago.  At that time we thought that this was the craziest movie we had ever seen and whoever it was who had written the script and made such an off the wall film was somewhat insane himself.  Yet, we were hysterically laughing throughout the entire film.  Upon watching the movie again, years later, nothing had changed.  I still found myself laughing throughout the entire movie.  It was just as off-beat as before.  It is a great cult classic and I would definitely recommend this film to others 
 The theme song is one of the best beach songs I have ever heard, and a 70's classic I think. But it's very rarely ever heard outside this movie. Paul Williams does have a cd with the song on it, but the song in the movie is performed by Dale Menten, and is very difficult to find 
 it works great, i'm using it as 2nd audio channel instead or adding a new audio adapter boar 
 If you have ever REALLY been in love, or wanted to be, you will relate like a bulls-eye to this film. I can't think of one thing that could be changed to improve this movie, and I can't say that about any other film.  The devotion of a mother to a husband lost in war, a little boy to an art and to the provider of that art. A town to the images from a far off and very different world. Then this little boy becomes a man constantly looking for the devotion from a woman, that ideal love he discovers from collecting film edits over many years. In life, he can only find love and devotion in the images on a screen. There is great joy and great regret, the director and writer play your emotions like a drum. Don't miss this, buy it, give it to people you love or to someone who needs to understand the difference between love and simple lust or infatuation. You laugh and you cry, I'm a guy hardened by the bumps in life and it brought tears streaming down my face. Get this, I have a number of different copies, but on Super Bowl Sunday, it was shown on TCM, and I found myself unable to turn the channel to the game, it's that special and engrossing. Enjoy, Steve Gilbert, A 
 The author of this book is absolutely right on in every  respect concerning the state of public school education and the preparation of our teachers and adminstrators.  I suspected this for years when i was in college observing practices in the school of education though never a part of it thank God! Then the impressions i got from my children's teachers during parent teacher conferences years later.  I thought these people seemed ignorant!  But I put it out of my mind as most people do.  My degree is in a real field so perhaps I am not qualified in judging "professional educators".  After reading it all in this book and others I realized that my suspicions were true!  As Mr. Gross states, all schools of education should be abolished at the bachelor, master, and doctoral levels and prospective teachers required to take real degrees in real fields.  Upon graduation they should then be required to take a semester in teaching techniques and one semester internship in student teaching though I don't personally think this is essential.  The best math teacher i ever had in  high school was a retired electrical engineer!  He was not certified by the establishment and probably didn't know anything about educational psychology...he was just good 
 Rex Ewing's Power with Nature was the only book we needed to tell us how to power our vacation home in Costa Rica. Our home is about ten miles from the nearest electrical lines and we had decided to do solar electric. I prepared myself mentally for plowing through a bunch of technical details and began reading. I was pleasantly surprised. In addition to telling you all the nitty gritty about power, this book is witty and fun to read, quite user friendly. After reading Ewing's explanation of the different options for off-the-grid power, we decided on a roof-top solar array with a bank of batteries in the basement.  Here in Costa Rica there is plenty of sun in the dry season. But in the rainy season we get lots of rain and the streams are all full. That's a problem because the cloudy conditions mean less solar energy. So we decided to supplement the solar with a water-driven Jack Rabbit turbine--something we didn't know existed before reading this book--in the stream that runs behind our house. I'm a complete dunce about electricity and my husband is just as bad, but Ewing's book tells it all in a way that even we could understand. We did exactly what he said and, guess what? Everything worked, just like it did for Rex and LaVonne.  If you want to learn about alternatives to traditional forms of power, or do like we did and actually build it yourself, I highly recommend Power with Nature 
 This is one of those books which needs a little introduction: in Australia, the Kelly Gang is famous the way that Dillinger or Bonnie and Clyde are in the US. This book shows Peter Carey trying (with much success) to recreate the rugged conditions of Australian life, and it is very well-written in a kind of rough-backcountry slang. It shows how incredibly talented Peter Carey is, and how his talents can be adapted over a wide range of subject matter 
      A pleasant little read providing delicious tidbits of information on the city that never sleeps.  A native New Yorker, Helene Hanff sets out to rediscover her city so to write a tour book.  Her love for the city is renewed as was mine.  Sadly, Helene Hanff passed away in 1997. The book was last updated in 1980 so its still a bit outdated.  Nevertheless very lovely, reminiscent, and timeless. It is easy to read and will provide you with a little bit of lore not found in guide books. It is not a comprehensive or indepth look at the city.  In fact it is quite fragmented and simplistic. It reads more like an adventure story than a guide book.   It is fun to read, full of dry humor, and it gives the reader enough taste of the apple to satisfy. Besides, NY city is much too big of a place to cover it all in one book. For those who are madly in love with NY, whether as a visitor or a native, this book is a must 
 Well I can say that The Lost World was good, but that's all I can say, because the Jurassic Park disc was MISSING 
 James Herriot continues the story of his veterinary practice, and his family life in England.  World War II is past, the children are growing.  His stories chronicle the changes....  
 This movie is funny is hell.  Three little words-omg i was dying.  Anyone know what song is playing when O'connel is in the car and he starts bumping it?  It sounds like Rage but im not sure 
 	The book fills with tense, actions, humor, and funny. The whole book is unpredictable! it makes me keep guessing what is going to happen next. It makes you laugh when you are nervous about what is going happened next. The book is fun and easy to read, and I love the main character! The book brings out a lot of dark sides of real life but without making reader feel depressed or hopeless about the world. When I was reading the book, I see and understand more bad sides about the society, but the writer brought it out by warm and fragrant way.   	Because of the main character was a policewoman and became a private cop. She always has a lot of situations need to solve, and has to social with different kinds of people in her daily life. There always must be many things that annoying her, but she always can make her own happy in any kind of situation; she is pretty optimistic! Her personality makes readers fill with hopes and happiness while reading the book.   	While I was reading the book, I not only learned how to solve problem by Carlotta's inference, but also learned how to look at things from different sides. Linda Barnes - the writer of the book, she wrote the whole story with stimulation and humor, it is really good for teenagers to read the book after school. She teaches readers things while readers enjoy reading. There is no hard word or sentence in the book; it is a good choice to read after a whole day work to relax 
 Whitmore has provided a very good secular overview and guide to coaching in Coaching for Performance (I am a Christian coach). It is easy to read and gives lots of examples of using coaching technique in everyday life and work. It appeals to me as a classic as Whitmore came in at the early days of coaching and writes with clarity and enthusiasm. In this edition outlines its development. I purchased this book as it was often quoted in the Life Caoching couse I studied as part of a theology degree.  As someone with a sporting background I find his many references to sports coaching quite natural, however I can see this as an irritation to anyone who has never experienced coaching in the sporting arena. These references however do add to the readers' understanding of coaching technique and practice. I would recommend this book to anyone new to coaching, but would suggest further study and supervised practice if you want to do more than simply use a few coaching techniques in your worlplace and everyday life 
 like many other people, i bought this cd just to have all of tim's, but i was happily surprised. even though the songs are more honky-tonk than his  other cd's and i don't normally go for that type of music, he makes it  work. i can't believe the songs never got radio-play. they're excellent! 
 This book is an excellent guide on what to do and see in Tokyo as well as providing insight into Japanese culture and language. It gives a list of the must-see items (don't miss Tsukiji fish market) with clear maps and  directions. It provides practical tips on how to get around (especially  important in a city that uses a non-roman alphabet!). I found the book  extremely useful on my recent (first) trip to Japan 
 Don't hate on Tavis Smiley, the man is real. He talks the talk and he is walks the walk.  Tavis always puts his money where is his mouth is.....People need to stop critizing and help a brotha out.  He always asks that everyone come out and support the causes, to assist in making changes for black america. Make sure you are doing your part before you criticize Mr. Smiley.  Because he is "Talking the Talk" and "Walking the Walk".  May God continue to bless his efforts 
 After years of wanting some overalls my wife got me a pair for my 35th birthday. She says I now look like the 5-yr inside of them.  But what are the two extra buttonholes in the bib pockets for? I figure one of them is for a pen or pencil, but I can't figure out what the other is for.  They are comfy, spacious, and have plenty of pocket room for tools and nails, nut and bolts. A must have for any man, though they are much sexier on women 
 Hello pedantic fools. Get a life and embody V. He is found in many guises, many forms, many times. To squabble over who makes V better is to argue over pencil colors or paper types WHILE THE BODIES DROP AND THE REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS OF THE EARTH, WHICH ARE ALL OF THEM AT THIS POINT, GEAR UP EVEN MORE FOR YOUR DEMISE INTO A TYRANNY UNEQUALED IN HISTORY!!!  Invite V into your heart today and remember 5th of November.  VVVV 
 I've worked, studied, traveled in China for 3 years 1986-1989 and know that Chang speaks the truth.  The fascade of a modern China is just that.  I've been awaiting a book such this, but now that it has been published, few want to hear the truth, especially those who are giddy with the prospect of making money in China.  Witty, clear, stylishly penned.  Bravo 
 "Solid" shows one of the greatest occasional sextets i've ever listened to. Grant Green in top form, Joe Henderson fabolous and versatile as usual, James Spauding with his great acid alto (too often underrated!),  and a rithmic section that doesn't need superfluous words! George Russel's  "Ezz-thetic" literally burns of an urgent fire(compare it with  Roach's hard bop version in "Plus four"), as well as Henderson's  "The kicker". Cook & Morton defined it marvellous, waiting  for the CD edition. Really it is 
 This is a wonderful little gem of a book!  Because it's a collection of tips, it's great to read in stolen moments of solitude - even 5-10 minutes at a time - although the author's style is so engaging, it's hard to put it down.  I'm not one to consider myself a princess, but I loved the tips for making an ordinary life more exotic and fun.  No matter who you are, or what your style is, you'll find ideas you can use.  Don't overlook this book as fluff because of it's title - it's a great find and so cleverly presented that it's also the perfect 'signature gift' 
 This is a book that seems to take all the guesswork out of "light" and healthy cooking.  The chefs that have prepared these recipes have practiced each recipe hundreds of times until they got the light version just right.  They give a great account of the nutritional information for each recipe and compare them to their fat filled, unhealthy counterparts 
 The Heart of the Matter by Graham Greene is a delightful read, both because of the simplicity of the language and honesty of the tale. Scobie is a middle aged Police Deputy Commissioner, obsessively sincere to his duty, and particularly useless to his book reading wife Louise. The tale is set in a West African colony, where it rains for six months, and apart from loneliness, bugs, roaches, malaria and third world struggles oppress the few white men who reside in the colony. Wilson appears in the colony and takes a liking to Louise. Before he can get anywhere, she leaves for South Africa.  A plot of circumstances makes Scobie's life a mesh where he needs to be the friend of very Yusef he despises and fall in love with twenty years younger, Mrs Rolt, or Helen. By the time his wife decides to return, he is tangled in a desperate struggle between two women, good and bad, his principles and everything he must do to compromise them, and the story proceeds into a realm of beautiful tragedy, leaving the reader spellbound.  There are few most memorable chapters in the novel. One is the description of a game Wilson and Harris invent and play, where they compete to hunt roaches. Other is the last one, where the Heart of Matter leaves you stunned and silenced in its sincere description for how little people matter once they are dead.  There are many sentences that I invariably will remember for a long time. Examples: 1) Virtue, the good life, tempted him in the dark like a sin. 2) Men become twins with age: the past was their common womb: the six months of rain and the six months of sun was the period of their common gestation. They needed only a few words and a few gestures to convey their meaning. 3)The word "pity" is used as loosely as the word "love": the terrible promiscuous passion which so few experience. 4) He listened with the intense interest one feels in a stranger's life, the interest the young mistake for love. AND LAST, but not the least 5) 'Of two hearts one is always warm and one is always cold: the cold heart is more precious than diamonds: the warm heart has no value and is thrown away. 
 Cavlli-Sforza presents a history of the human race looking at how humanity spread out of Africa and has changed and evolved. He looks at things such as blood types and proteins explaining why differences might arise between different groups of people. He looks at different of primates such as neanderthals showing how modern man arose. He also gives reasons for genetic variation such as drift and chance. He also looks at groups such as the Basque and Lapps in Europe who have unique genetic makeups and languages that seperate themselves from other Europeans. One impressive thing that is dealt with in the book was the link between language and evolution. He shows how groupings of languages can show how humans spread through time 
 I loved this story!  I am from a large Italian family and I thorougly enjoyed the picture that was portrayed in this book.  I could picture the city and the small Italian restaurant.  I could also almost taste the food.  I thought the plot was excellent and the characters were well painted.  I wished that the person who was the arsonist was a little more difficult to guess.  It was the most obvious.  But, I highly recommend the book...you could almost smell the smoke!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Claimed by Shadow picks up a little after Touch the Dark and Cassie is in far over her head more than ever.  Trouble seems to follow her like the plague since she is destined to be the Pythia.  Of course there is still one thing left she has to do before she can gain that power.  You'll never guess who "helps" her with that.  Then she still has to deal with Myra, who is planning something big to try to take the power of Pythia for herself.  Cassie must go through time and find the right time when Myra plans to do the deed (which I don't want to give away).  She also has a geis on her that comes from that very vampire, the geis is sort of like a claim on  her to tell others to back off.  This geis is a problem for her and she tries to find a way to remove it.  But Cassie is still on the outs with the Vampire Senate and ends up getting help from an unlikely ally 
 Jasper Fforde must be a seriously demented individual. First we have the tales of Thursday Next, who travels into books and other assorted places, and now we have detectives who solve crimes involving nursery rhyme characters! I will give the author credit for building a fairly convincing world into which he places his players. Actually, the murder plot is quite good, worthy of a regular crime novel (despite the odd characters), and there are enough red herrings to fill a medium sized aquarium. We have well-delineated characters, and they act appropriately. In sum, this is a book for those who have a perverted and weird sense of humor (as I do), and who are quick to spot the allusions to other works and things. It's enjoyable fun, and what more can you ask from a book of this type 
 One other reviewer used the term "between academia and pop nonfiction".  I suppose accurate pop non fiction was what I was looking for as I was trying to get an overview of the mind set or zeitgeist of prerevolutionary France. It was a little narrower in it's scope than I expected but in hind sight accomplished it's goal in giving me a feeling for that period which in turn helps putting the revolution  in context.    For me this book complimented "Holy Madness : Romantics, Patriots, and Revolutionaries, 1776-1871"by Adam Zamoyski  I would recommend the book for those interested in folk stories and fairy tales. I enjoyed the comparisons of the same themes expressed the folk literature of Germany, England, Italy etc 
 Last year I attended a cooking class at Sur le Table where Sharon demonstrated some of her recipes, and the entire class was in culinary heaven!  Sharon's collection of recipes using lavender is diverse and unique, and will add a sumptuous note to your cooking repertoire. Elegant or simple, these recipes invoke images of France, and inspire me to invite friends over for special meals. This cookbook will be one of your favorites! Enjoy!  Edible lavender can be ordered online from Dean & Deluca http://www.deananddeluca.com 
 The text is among the most interesting interpretations of gender and sexuality from the perspective of the theory of evolution. It contributes new material to the old nature-nurture controversy on the subject. I assigned this book to my undergraduate students as one of ten texts I use for a course in genders and sexualities and students liked it a lot. It is very well written and stimulates a good, intelligent discussion. It works well as an invitation to further studies of gender and sexuality 
 This is a charming book which explains the sweet relationship that enriches the lives of people who are pet owners.  It also can ease the pain when the relations ends in death.  
 This is by no means a light reading. Let's read the first four paragraphs of Chapter XVIII.   "It is necessary to name Him Whose silence I share and worship, for in His silence He also speaks my own name. He alone knows my name, in which I also know His name. For in the instant in which He calls me "my Son" I am aware of Him as "my Father." This recognition is, in me, an act, in Him a Person. This act in me is the movement of His Person, His Spirit, His Love, within me. When He moves, I move with Him, so that it is I also who move. And in my movement I both waken to know that "I am" and I cry "Abba, Father."   But since I am not my own father, it is useless for me to seek to awaken this recognition of Him by calling myself "Son" in the hollow of my own silence. My own voice is only able to rouse a dead echo when it calls out to itself. There will never be any awakening in me unless I am called out of darkeness by Him Who is my light. Only He Who is Life is able to raise the dead. And unless He names me, I remain dead and my silence is the silence of death.  As soon as He speaks my name, my silence is the silence of infinite life, and I know that I am because my heart has opened to my Father in the echo of the eternal years.  My life is listening. His is a speaking. My salvation is to hear and respond. For this, my life must be silent. Hence my silence is my salvation. "  In case you appreciate the above, I think you will love this book. If not, please give it a pass.    Below please find some easier messages I like much fyi:-  Living is not thinking. Thought is formed and guided by objective reality outside us. Living is the constant adjustment of thought to life and life to thought in such a way that we are always growing, always experiencing new things in the old and old things in the new. Thus life is always new. pg 17  Without courage we can never attain to true simplicity. Cowardice keeps us double minded, hesitating between the world and God. In this hesitation, there is no true faith. Faith remains an opinion....What is the use of praying if at the very moment of prayer we have so little confidence in God that we are busy planning our own kind of answer to our prayer? pg 24  The solitary, more than anyone else, is always aware of his poverty and of his needs before God. Since he depends on God directly on everything material and spiritual, he has to ask for everything. His prayer is an expression of his poverty. Petition, for him, can hardly become a mere formality, a concession to human custom, as if he did not need God in everything. pg 105  The great work of the solitary life is gratitude. The hermit is one who knows the mercy of God better than other men because his whole life is one of complete dependence, in silence and in hope, upon the hidden mercy of our Heavenly Father. pg 12 
 Referred to as the ICE QUEEN, Mistress Marguerite is very well known and respected within the walls of The Zone, an exclusive BDSM club she frequents.  Marguerite thrives on control and routine in her personal life as well as her Domme life.  She never looks anyone directly in the eyes, never picks the same sub twice, and allows very little to no physical touching.  All of these are traits that have not gone unnoticed by fellow Dom, Tyler, and he fully intends to break through the ICE QUEEN's frosty exterior and get to the woman beneath.  Tyler Winterman is a part owner of The Zone as well as a Dominant himself.  Because of a computer error Marguerite never fulfilled the terms of the mentoring program that is required by the club, which includes her learning about BDSM from the subs point of view.  Tyler sees this glitch as his chance to get to know Marguerite as a woman.   The more Tyler gets to know her, the more he's intrigued, but will he be able to break through the mental barriers Marguerite keeps erecting?  Marguerite has been a Domme at The Zone for almost two years.  The idea of playing the part of a sub for another Dom terrifies her.  She invites Tyler to meet with her at her business, Tea Leaves to discuss this requirement.  Once Tyler mentions that he's a part owner of the club, Marguerite tries to convince Tyler to lie for her.  He has other ideas for her and they require that she go through with the training.  He wants to see her lose that control.  From watching her over time, he's aware that she always holds back with her subs, and everything appears synchronized.  He knows that she's an excellent Domme, but wonders if she could possibly be a switch.  Her physical reaction to his presence is more of what he'd expect from a submissive.  However, to uncover the real Marguerite, he'll have to brave the violent reactions she exhibits when feeling threatened in any way.    Joey W. Hill's ICE QUEEN will take readers deep into the more intense BDSM club scene.   Both Marguerite and Tyler are well-known Dominants, but you get the sense that Marguerite is hiding behind her ICE QUEEN image - like she's playing a part.  I am so impressed with Tyler and the extreme patience and understanding he exhibits with Marguerite.  ICE QUEEN had me so hooked I just made the trip over to Ellora's Cave and purchased the first two books of Ms. Hill's NATURE OF DESIRE series and anxiously awaiting the next book MIRROR OF MY SOUL (in print) which contains the rest of Marguerite and Tyler's story.   
 What is amazing about this album is it is an all R&B album. Usher's voice on this album is smooth and different from any other album he has. It is an excellent debut album and with music at a stand still it's nice to go back in time. Some few favs are.... Can U Get With It? Think Of You The Many Ways You Took My Heart Final GoodBye I'll Make It Right Slow Love And More... 
 I grew up in  Hannibal Mo, so I am very familiar with Mark Twain's writing and his humor.  The make up is great as Holbrook even looks like Twain.  Holbrook is a great story teller, and he uses the material well, and makes it wa wonderful program.  I saw a perfomance live in NYC years ago, and another one in my current home town.  Each time I see it again, it is still funny and a great performance 
 After several years of giving myself "buzz-cuts" I decided to go for a quality set of clippers. I had been using one of those kits which included all of the plastic guards etc. which fell in the $30 price range at Target. There is NO comparison. The Oster Classic 76 is the "Cadillac" of clippers. From the moment you turn them on, you can tell by the smoothness and power of the motor that you have stepped up to top quality clippers. They come with a [1] blade and a [000] blade. I purchased a [0000] which is great for real close shaves or fades. I'm confident these will last for years since I'm using them at home and not in a shop. I would definitely buy this brand again  
 This is a very up to date collection of poster portfolios from graphic designers around the world. Besides the overall quality, the interesting point is the diversity (of origins and approaches) and the texts about the creation process of each piece. A must have 
 If like me you are in love with Edwige Fenech this movie is a must have. I love the soundtrack and surreal S&M imagery which Sergio Martino peppers his film with. Like a beautiful dream, hypnotic, sensual lust pumped up massively by the melodious melancholic score, one of my favorites. NoShame films have given the viewer a magnificent uncut transfer which looks stunning plus extensive special features. A highly impressive dvd in the same league as the best releases from masters Anchor Bay and Blue Underground. I for one will be keeping an eye open for future releases from these bright new dvd stars. 10 / 10 
 If your child owns the Nitro Notebook then you definitely must invest in this case.  Not only is it made for this notebook, but it's the perfect size for kids.  It's very durable and, since it's made specifically for the Nitro Notebook, will protect it in all the right places!  Nice design too!  Roomy enough for the notebook and accessories.  I think was a very smart purchase! 
 Margaret Truman treats the reader to an intimate biography of her father.  She tells the traditional stories of his courtship and life long love affair with Bess, his life on the farm, his service in World War I and his unsuccessful haberdashery venture.  She continues on through his entry into politics and involvement with the Pendergast machine.  The senate campaigns of 1934 and 1940 and the choice for Vice President set the stage for Harry Truman's role of a lifetime.  His succession to the Presidency started a dizzying sequence of crises including the founding of the United Nations, the use of the atomic bomb and the surrender of Japan.  He then lead the country through a rash of post war strikes and inflation leading to Democratic defeat in the 1946 Congressional elections.  Rebounding, Truman fought off the Berlin Blockade and won a stunning upset victory in the 1948 elections.  In his second term he restored the decaying White House, was harassed by Joseph McCarthy and had his presidency redefined by the Korean War.  Deciding not to seek reelection, Truman began his unsuccessful effort to mold Adlai Stevenson into his successor.  After leaving the White House, Truman found most of his satisfaction in his family and in teaching others about government.  I like this book for its intimate view of Harry Truman's life.  Margaret provides a perspective lacking in all other biographers.  Her view of family life and the quotes from Harry's diaries and letters make this book a unique delight.  In dealing with aspects of Truman's life this book lacks the depth found in some other biographies.  In some respects, Margaret is a bit too strident in defense of her Father.  I recommend other works for an initial Truman biography and this one to deepen the reader's understanding of Harry.  Other books provide a better understanding of the historical Harry Truman.  Margaret provides an excellent introduction to her Dad 
 If you are learning to play the game, or want to learn a new version of VP, this is a great place to start. Good explanations as to the "why's" of the correct plays, and sound strategies for many common games 
 This is a story about 3 women, Willa, Lily and Tess who inherit a Montana Ranch from their deceased father who never laid claim to any of the 3 women. Willa was the only one left on the ranch and assumed she'd inherit until the will was read. In the will Jack Mercy, their father, stated that the only way any of them would get a piece of his pie was if they all lived on the ranch for a year together. They had never met before this day.  This is a story of family, love, trust, and murder. Ms Roberts has a way of wrapping your mind around one idea only to have you so convinced and then bam, the story changes. This story has quickly become one of my favorite Nora Roberts independent romantic suspense novels. She is a favorite in general, but his one had me anticipating what would happen next. 
 This book tells the story of a woman scientist who I had never heard of.  Her work on DNA is only a part of the book.  She died of ovarian cancer in her late thirties.  The book suggests that she might have married a fellow scientist, Don Caspar, had she not become ill. The science is accessible and held my interest.  Maddox by no means paints her as a saint but presents both the positive and negative.  It sounded like she may have been arrogant at times but she certainly had no picnic in making her way in science in the fifties.  Very moving story 
 As an former DJ, I've wondered about the state of radio in this day and age. Michael Keith has done an excellent job of capturing it with this book. Mr Keith does a great job of describing radio's history, from its humble beginnings to today's world of culture of deregulation and consolidation, as well as also describing all the various departments and jobs within a station. I wish there'd been a book like this around when I was an announcer.  There are chapters devoted to programming (and various formats), sales, news, and research (always important facets that folk don't always think about), promotion, commercial production, even one on engineering (let us never forget the job the sometimes underappreciated engineers perform).  If you want to get into radio broadcasting or (like me) have an interest in the field and where it's headed you need to get this book 
 Twenty-five years of hard use, and eight children later, my Lecrueset cookware is still in excellent condition.  Now, I am adding some of those special pieces I could never afford.  Amazon is wonderful to work with.  Not only did I get a very good "buy", but all was delivered promptly and just in time for Christmas.  Families grow and grow...and Lecreuset has a size for everything.  Thanks so much.  Patricia Welte 
 This Boynton Book comes with access to a free mp3 of a companion song, sung by Davey Jones of the Monkees.  The book (and the song) are simply about a penguin who wants to be best friends with a hippo.  The illustrations are hilarious and the song is a lot of fun.  The book as a stand alone doesn't seem all that interesting, but when you pair it with the song it is great!  I have an 18 month-old who adores this book, but only when I sing it! 
 This is One of the best books I have ever read 
 This is the best and clearest text on the YBA [Young British Artists] phenonomenon of the 1990s - required reading for anyone who is interested in Damien Hirst, Jake and Dinos Chapman and their peers. A little spoilt by a certain Marxist rigidty of attitude but highly intelligent and frequently amusing as well 
 This book gets you through your day and your life better. May you find your way to enlightenment. Get Buddha in Daily Life 
 This is a very readable and complete book on Design and Analysis of Digital Integrated Circuits. It has many great examples and in depth explanations. The book compares the differences between different technologies and the general trends for deep submicron circuits. It is also very complete as it covers subjects from fabrication and layout, memory design, high speed CMOS logic design as well as power grid and clock design. This book is a must in the library of anyone interested in digital circuit design 
 Trevor Palmer's study is a thoroughly researched, well written addition to what is now a small library documenting catastrophes in Earth history and in the history of civilization.  Catastrophes may come from three sources: asteroids and comets, climatic adversities, and geophysical convulsions.   All enjoy high public visibility today, but this awareness is quite recent-basically since about 1980.  Prior to that, belief in catastrophes was dismissed by progressive thought as a remnant of religious delusions, which thrive on the frisson of sudden interventions by the gods.  The possibility that these delusions might be the mythopoetic expression of the experience of naturally-caused events was dismissed because, it was said, nature operates by regular natural laws, not by unpredictable fits and starts.  When it was pointed out that volcanoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricanes, forest fires, and such like meet this description, the response was that they are purely local events lacking the muscle to threaten civilization.  The received wisdom was especially hostile to the idea that rocks from space could threaten life on Earth.  All that's now changed.  Global warming and the destruction of biodiversity are accepted by the international community to place civilization at risk.  Astronomy, inundated with data gathered by space exploration, learned that there are billions of loose rocks in the asteroid belt situated between Mars and Jupiter, and that they have struck the inner planets, including Earth, many times.  The inner planets, they say, are a `cosmic shooting gallery' so active that asteroids even strike asteroids!  Two of the five mass extinctions are confirmed as resulting from asteroid strikes plus volcanoes, and the other three may be due to the same causes.  By an ironic twist in the progress of knowledge, the denial of catastrophes is now the delusion.  Palmer's study is the best available guide to this momentous change in the view of our place in nature.   
  Classic.  If you consider the classic elegance of Edward Kennedy Ellington, it should come as no surprise that his prose is as lyrical and poetic as his music.  This is a wonderful collection of writings.  It is in effect an arrangement of essays and short pieces written with what I suspect is love about the love of his life-jazz, or music itself, if you will.  The book contains many short pieces-impressionistic sketches and characters of persons that Duke Ellington knew-musicians, friends, acquaintances, public figures.  But it also has a variety of essays-longer subjects interwoven with themes and counterpoint.  Ellington's is exquisitely musical prose-again, not to be surprised.  The organization is chronological, narrative, more or less.  Duke organizes with autobiographical passages followed by short portraits-Dramatis Felidae-that demonstrate the concreteness through brief descriptions of the persons that he knew with anecdotes that define them.  The book covers a life filled with friends and experience.  The variety is tremendous, and the life and the career are masterpieces.  The themes and subjects are multifaceted.  This is Duke Ellington's poetic literary suite posing as prose, and it should not be missed.  Really-it's great poetry and a terrific compendium of jazz history and experience 
 This is an excellent critique of high development theory. Although good economists will know the main faults of their disapline, this text elegantly explains why development theory lost its direction. I will not divulge the main ideas, they are well worth the money to find out. -  Economists consist of two groups, those that don't know, and those who  don't know that they don't know 
 each and every day we take the world in and we make a very crucial decision: is this or that true?  is this or that false?  and if we take a step further we might find ourselves using the word "why" more  often than usual.  Why is this true?  how do i really know?  This is  exactly what Descartes is getting at with Meditations on First Philosophy.   The first time I read it, I found myself re-reading again and again;  underlining portions to make the very act of re-reading easier.  One must  posess maticulousness and great patience to truely envelop the concepts  brought forth by Descartes in this work.   If you read it not to understand  what is behind truth and error, then read it to experience the drama and  beauty that Descartes employs to present the logic that founds his  conclusions.   If you wish to explore what one man found when he asked,  "how is it that we can distinguish between reality and dream, and why  is it that humanity is plagued by error?", then you must immerse  yourself in this book, and pay it the maticulous attention that it demands 
 Wow, what can I say that 100+ other reviewers haven't already said, except, "Far out, dude!" This is a terrific read for people who don't normally read fantasy, provided you're willing to open your mind a bit. What about the younger readers? No problem--they will "get" this book where some adults won't. It's not so much about magic as it is a magical adventure in "suspension of disbelief"--my favorite phrase when it comes to fantasy writing. Enjoy 
 This is my first Nancy Pickard novel and I have to say, I really enjoyed it.  This novel is an easy read and once you begin, you would not want to put it down.    Pickard wrote it beautifully and it is not confusing at all as with most suspense novels.  For those who have not read any of Pickard's work, I recommend starting with this one.  I am definately giving her other works a chance.  Enjoy 
 Winger's second album, In the Heart of the Young, continues in the same vein of slick, progressive-tinged, radio-ready pop-metal featured on their debut - almost what Asia or 90125-era Yes might sound like as hair bands. The melodies and guitars still twist and turn in unpredictable directions, but the material on In the Heart of the Young isn't always as musically interesting as the songs on Winger. Plus, the inclusion of more ballads detracts from the overall energy. Still, there's enough here to make the album worthwhile for anyone who enjoyed its predecessor, especially in the absence of a best-of collection. "Miles Away" became a Gulf War love anthem, while "Can't Get Enuff" and "Easy Come Easy Go" are fine rockers that nevertheless failed to make much of a dent in the charts 
 First, let me start by saying that this is a different kind of book. There are plenty of moving books out there that descibe transitions or tragedy in some way or another. This book is a searing reminder of how vital it is to try and create perfect moments and perfect days, whether you have 3 months or 30 years left to live. And the primary author of this book takes us on a journey of his transition from CEO of a major firm, to his last days: his successful and purposeful life cut short. He does not wallow in self-pity (which perhaps if he did a little, it might make his book feel slightly more approachable to the reader), but instead Gene O'Kelly offers lessons he has drawn from his life, his efforts at closing relationships, and making his last months the best of his life. He offers a path to living life more fully, something we can all use reinforcement with. I read this book until late on a couple of nights, as I grappled with the loss of a parent, and took stock of my own life. I found Gene O'Kelly's insights meaningful and deep, in his measured, succinct, and purposeful writing. Definitely a book well-worth thinking about, as you read it once, twice, or even three times 
 I picked this book up browsing in my hospital bookshop while on call on a lazy saturday. On the back cover I discovered it had been recently translated into Italian (2004)from English and decided to buy it. From the moment I opened it, I couldn't put it down, I read it on work, at home, and also while driving the car (!). I laughed by myself on more than one occasion and looked around for someone to laugh with me. Naturally, I will probably never go to Mongolia, or have the guts to take the trip the author went through, but, somehow I felt that I was there. That I met the people he describes.   One interesting point of the book is its inspiration from the trip of William of Rubruc eight centuries ago. This short miliary description of the mongol world of those times has the same off hand descriptions of the mongol people and customs we find in Mr. Stewart's book.  However, no one accused William of beeing "politically not correct" or "sarcastic". Often it is not necessary to have an empathic vision of a different culture to describe it to people that share our cultural standards.   Mr. Stewart's book is instructive and definitely fun to read, but above all it "takes you along" the whole time, which is really what readers that don't have the opportunities to travel as much as they would like, really want 
 This book helped me see that I needed a new battle plan to keep my home organized.  Using the concept of a kindergarten classroom to develop a plan was extremely helpful.  Setting up areas to have a specific function and placing all of the "tools" needed in that location not only saves time in cleaning things up, but being able to locate them again easily.  Also, having storage, or a "home" for things close to where they are used makes it more likely they will be put away instead of being left out.  We are a messy family of 5 and the concepts in this book are easy for everyone in the house to follow.  I highly recommend this to anyone fighting excess clutter 
 Since I don't own rabbits nor do I like rabbits, I was suprised to really enjoy this book.  I always find it interesting when an author uses animals to craft a very human story.  It involves fath, friendship and cooperation plus so much more.  These rabbits are shown that freedom is worth fighting for, and it really is inspirational.  Read it 
 The Nordstrom Way was not developed overnight.  It has been four generations and over one hundred years in the making.  It is a culture, not an act that can be turned on and off.  It is a pleasure also to have its recent top salesman Patrick McCarthy share his story.    The Nordstrom Way oozes with pride... the pride of providing a top-rate retail experience.  Salesmen are empowered to make decisions.  This is not just lip service.  They carry a card which states "Rule #1: Use your good judgement in all situations.  There will be no additional rules."  Emphasis is given to placing the needs of the customer ahead of short-term profits.  Other aspects of this 'culture' include promoting only from within and profit-sharing.   Most retail outlets have a small Customer Service department.  At Nordstrom, the whole store is the Customer service department.  The Nordstrom Way embodies simple concepts that are not necessarily easy for other companies to duplicate.    Five Star 
 Though John Mayer is new to me, I have always liked the 'soft rock' genre. I got drawn in by the easy rock guitar selections, (especially 'Clarity') and listening to the lyrics came later.   John Mayer...easy on my ears. I'll try another CD. I think this music could grow on me. 
 This has been a great tool in helping my kids understand why they should not eat junk!  Highly recommended 
 I like this book because it puts everything in perspective of what one can do just to live simply.  While is was written pre-9/11, many of the stories listed can still be applied right now, when everything is under the pretense of buy more, buy bigger (gas crisis not excluded), many of the principals can be applied when it feels like life is just too much, and stuff is taking over in multiple quantities.  I recommend this book as well as "Your Money or Your Life".  You will find that you will refer to both books, time and time again to set you on a more purposeful path in life 
 This was my first reading of Mr. King's work and I was amazed. This book held my attention for days and I've yet to finsh reading it. My absolute favorite is "Rainy Season." I keep re-reading this story which is why I haven't finished the book. Great reads include "Sorry, Right Number" "Dolan's Caddilac" and "Chattery Teeth" I am a now a die-hard and devoted fan and I reccomend this to anyone beginning a Stephen King collection

 At first, I borrowed this from the library because I love Norbert Leo Butz. He was very good in Wicked, but the part of Freddy Benson seems made for him. I can't wait to see the show; the entire cast is amazing. Some of my favorite tracks: -Great Big Stuff -All About Ruprecht -Here I Am -Ruffhousin' mit Shuffhausen -The More We Dance  -Love is my Legs -Dirty Rotten Number  All three of the leads are completely at ease in their parts, even though John Lithgow and Sherie Rene Scott have since moved on. If you like good old-fashioned comedy, this is a show for you 
 We LOVE this bubble machine. My kids have been using it for a year now with no problems. They use it inside and out. My oldest daughter even use it at her birthday dance party because of the amount of bubbles it releases. Have a great time with this toy, we are 
 IT WAS VERY ROOMY AND THE COLOR WAS AS DESCRIBED. ONCE AGAIN AMAZON HAS DONE A MARVELOUS JOB. MANY THANKS!!!! 
 Although Stiglitz makes it extremely readable and more elegant in his Economics of the Public Sector, I found it more effective to learn the subject due to the deeper treatment of the models and theories 
 I love all of maeve binchy's work, so i was looking forward to this book.  I like to see how the character's lives are interconnected.  The ending was a happy surprise for me, resolving the conflict. 
 As a non skydiver I found this book to be in tune with life in general.  Not only did it get major points with me for its realistic view on human behavior but it gave me tools to use in places that I was helpless before.  I participate in team sports and this book has been instrumental in MY PART as a team member.  I have several friends that play college and high school level team sports and they have all found this beek to be very helpful in how they relate to their team and the teams goals.  I thank the man who wrote this book for including everyone and not just making it for skydivers.  John DeRosalia had writtin this book in such a way that I feel anyone who is alive on this planet can relate to its content, sports or no sports. This book was meant for everyone, I am sure of that 
 John Harvey Kellogg, founder of the Battle Creek Sanitarium and developer of the corn flake, is committed to improving the health and well-being of his devoted disciples by promoting a life free of meat, alcohol, tobacco, and sex.  In 1907, people flock to the San for lengthy stays to cleanse their bodies of impurities and improve their lives.  Will Lightbody has stomach problems, and, encouraged by his wife Eleanor, a Kellogg believer, he agrees to accompany her for several months with Dr. Kellogg.   On the train they meet Charlie Ossining, a young man who wants to set up a rival company to Kellogg's to make corn flakes and to take advantage of the growing health industry.  Charlie, who has a sleazy partner, is raising money for the manufacture of Perfo breakfast food, and when he and his partner team up with George Kellogg, one of John Kellogg's many adopted sons, the attempt to capitalize on John Kellogg's pioneering work becomes personal.  Charlie and the Lightbodys go their separate ways in Battle Creek and then reconnect throughout the novel, as Boyle shows Dr. Kellogg's excesses in the name of health--husbands and wives separated to prevent sex, grasses used for food, and regular enemas administered to rid the body of impurities.  At the same time, he shows how easy it may be for fly-by-night operators, like Charlie and his partners, to capitalize on the natural desire of people to lead healthier lives.  Will Lightbody, enrolled at the clinic, remains skeptical about the doctor's methods and frequently rebels against the most egregious practices, and through him Doyle is able to show the arguments made for and against particular health practices and the willingness of ordinary people to be duped.  The satire here is broad and universal, but Doyle is far more interested in telling a good story than in mounting an attack.  When some of the "disciples," especially Eleanor Lightbody, begin to experiment with techniques of "manipulation therapy, " advocated by a rival of Kellogg, the humor enters the realm of the absurd, and when George Kellogg confronts his estranged father, it reaches its peak.  Great fun to read and filled with amusing comments on our preoccupation with health, Boyle reminds us that the health industry can ultimately provide "the 'open sesame' to the sucker's purse."   n  Mary Whipple  
 Along with Alphabet Soup, I've given these books as a gift to several friends. I've found children from toddler age and up find the illustrations beautiful and they learn at the same time 
  How thrilling it was to discover Amazon had 'The Witness of the Stars,' available for review.  Published posthumously, the work displays the integrity of E.W. Bullinger's efforts to apply several major disciplines of scholarship as he introduces this edifying unveiling of God's Glory proclaimed across the sky.  Mr. Bullinger entered the Lord's presence nearly a century ago in 1913!  'The Witness of the Stars,' provides scholastic, historical, and Biblical insight into God's own testimony as to the past, present and future of mankind.  What a wind of refreshment in a world seemingly helpless and out of control.    A first mention of the thesis that God has written the Gospel in the Stars was introduced to this reviewer while in Bible School by since graduated Evangelist Lester Roloff.  Mr. Roloff had been inspired to examine this field partly because, as a traveling evangelist, he actually flew his own plane from meeting to meeting. He testified to ever being humbled during night flights across the earth. Having been introduced through Scripture's own declarations concerning God's setting the Heavens to declare His Glory, Psalm 19:1, Mr. Roloff went on to pen his findings.  And then how encouraging to read the reviews already given. Only the first handful of entries were able to be perused, yet, they proved the depths discerned on a mere first reading of 'Witness.'  This book is a must purchase for any seeking truth.  One reading simply whets the appetite to discover and plumb the depths of Mr. Bullinger's myriad offerings.  Kudos to Amazon for making this book on eternal truth available to the world.  Salutations to all in the Lord that have confirmed one's own impressions were in perspective.  To God be the Glory!

 Why should we take an interest in a war that happened four centuries before the birth of Christ? It is because this disastrous 27-year war between Athens and Sparta had a major impact on the development of the Western world. It finally ended in 404 B.C.E., and recent evidence suggests that Athens finally succumbed not to force of arms, but to typhoid. The result of the war was to put an end to hopes of Greek unification, and it was only a matter of time before the weakened Greek cities would fall victim to foreign conquest and lose the freedoms that were the vital essence of Greek civilization, and their greatest gift to the world. The triumph of Spartan oligarchy over Athenian democracy left a long shadow over the development of Western civilization.  Thucydides is considered by many to be the first great critical Western historian. He was a wealthy Athenian who was born around 460 B.C.E. and died around the age of sixty. He is chiefly remembered for this important book, and for a few pithy epigrams and quotations: "History is philosophy teaching by examples;" and "Be convinced that to be happy means to be free and that to be free means to be brave. Therefore do not take lightly the perils of war."   When the Peloponnesian War broke out, he is thought to have been about 28 or 29 years old, and rose to the rank of general before being exiled for his military failure at the Battle of Amphilpolis. In those days, military failure was counted a crime.  This book is a meticulous chronicle of the disastrous war. Until this work, historians simply recorded events. But his was different: an attempt to find inside information from people on both sides, and to interpret some of the turning points of the whole war and some of the terrible decisions that ultimately changed history.  There will always be squabbles about different translations and versions of a classic text, but this one is as good as they come, and well worth looking at for its insights into some of the events that fashioned our world 
 This Major Dundee (The Extended Version) A Must See,'tis a great Western Movie,I have it on dvd  :) 
 If you really want to know about trails in The Bob Marshall Wilderness area this is covers the most important trails. The hike descriptions and profiles are quite helpful in planning a trek. I have used this book a few times although it is a bit heavy to carry on the trail. Use it to plan and take a copy of the hikes needed to cover your trek 
 There are some very sensible, eminently implementable ideas in this book, even if you have nothing to do with risk management. It is not just about risk, and neither is it just about software projects. Yes, there are strong elements of both, but the discussion is not exclusive. Some of the practical matters discussed include being able to recognise a 'dead' project before it finally rolls over and is declared dead. If there is no life in the beast, then it is no use preserving the carcass.  Risk has been become a vogue word in software development. Everybody talks about it, and says that it is being considered. However, a large part of the discussion is lip service. What is apparent is that 'risk' is not a small subject, and any discussion on this subject will invariably involve weighty matters. How can benefits be calculated? How are costs determined?   So is risk inherently wrong? Risk involves uncertainty. Halfway down the first page of Chapter 1 is a wonderful statement, summing up the gains to be claimed by embarking on a risky venture. "If a project has no risks, don't do it".  The authors slay a few myths along the way. It is not wrong to be uncertain. Risk is about trying to minimise the uncertainties, or rather to minimise the damage caused by events that you hope will not happen. Therefore, if you don't know, ask questions about what you do not know. That is very different to some work places, where it is considered bad form to raise items on the risk register. There are instances when blindingly obvious risks have not been considered. "Oh, you mean THAT train" - as it speeds towards you. Projects that negotiate dark railroad tunnels will find trains hurtling towards them. FACT. It is the nightmares that need to be addressed, not the petty worries.  The book is very good about imposed deadlines. By all means perform estimates based upon everything happening correctly, and on time (in other words, 'downhill with a following wind'). However, this is not sufficient for implementing REAL projects, in real timescales. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to add in the uncertainties. Add these in before publishing the figures. There is a tool available on the associated web-site that enables some of the classic uncertainties to be factored in. This uses some industry standard figures to indicate the effect of, say, key staff leaving. The big no-no of software development is also discussed - what if the project fails? Figures indicate that a significant number of software projects fail (the authors quote 15%, but others may use different figures). Therefore failure has to be a risk on any project.  The authors discuss 'Earned Value Running' [EVR] as a way of measuring progress. Using such a measure moves away from the "90% complete" problem, and also enables the 'bells and whistles' of a project to be seen for what they are; items that are nice to have, but not item that are part of the core functionality. Such concepts as EVR can make a difference, and examples are provided from real life projects about many of the items discussed.  Much concerning 'risk' is involved with sharing knowledge, be this what is known or what is unknown. It is only when there is a culture of openness that there is a freedom to share risks (it is after all a risky business to discuss the items that would cause your department to fail to deliver to schedule). There a large variety of items that can follow on from an effective risk management strategy. One of these is what the authors call 'proactive incremental delivery'. This is equated with playing the loosing hands from your bridge hand first. However, what is written is not a prescriptive approach. After all, that would be risky!  There is one final point I wish to mention with this volume. There is a discussion of when NOT to share your risks with others. It takes a good deal of confidence to argue in part against the central thesis of a practical book. This is a VERY good, practical book, whose authors are not afraid to advise when not to use the ideas within.  Peter Morgan, Bath, UK (morganp@supanet.com 
 Frances' friends decided she desperately needs an intervention to save her life or something like it. No, she's not a pill head or drunk, she's addicted to unrequited love for her best friend, Blue's, brother, Theo. Unless she gives it up and starts doing coed things with other guys and having a life, they will portray her as a stalker to Theo and ruin her chances with him. So, she joins the student newspaper and lands an important assignment on the first day; host a Homework club to integrate the all boys and all girls schools. She knows immediately it's a huge and possibly impossible assignment, but gives it her best shot. Only one taker shows up, a nerdy guy who'd be perfect for her, perfectly awful at least. So, a bit of blackmail gets Theo to help her by bringing his friends over, the problem being that all they study is how to party, with maybe a bit of sex ed. Frances is outraged, Theo amused. He challenges her to loosen up by sneaking out to go on an educational date with him, but he's the one educated.   **** Nerds can have fun and be cool too. This book will give every shy, brainy girl a ray of hope and a few laughs. Its innocent sensuality almost reminds you of "Dirty Dancing", whose heroine has the same name as the star of this book. If you liked Putting Boys on the Ledge, you'll like this one twice as much. ****   Amanda Killgor 
 I loved reading The Last Spymaster,  It is one of those rare books you hate to see come to an end.  The characters have become your friends, and you want to follow along as they go on through life, especially because Jay, Raina, and Elaine will no doubt continue to live fascinating lives.  
 I read it when one of my kids had to read it. A great story and brings up a lot of American history for teaching and learning (about the Gold Rush) 
 I love this cd.  It is rich and sensual.  I first heard part of it on the film "Unfaithful."  I will definitely be buying more of this artist 
 These bags I bought for my son and daughter are great.  Last year I bought a bookbag for my daughter and it broke close to the end of the year.  I was quite upset because I bought this from a reliable department store.  Well this time around the bookbag is holding up even with all the books that my fifth grader brings home 
 What can I say, Yu Yu Hakusho was a great, and I mean GREAT,  show.  I loved it 
 I bought the heart shaped disney princess phone for my daughter for Christmas and what a piece of junk that was. So I bought her this Hello Kitty phone to replace the other that has never worked.  This Hello Kitty phone is very durable and just really cute.  If your going to buy to a nice cute product for a young girl that wants a phone, I recommend this. Awesome! 
 The Godfather by Mario Puzo is one of the best selling novels of all time, but its film adaptation, (1972) directed by the young filmmaker, Francis Coppola, set a new benchmark in epic filmmaking. What set this film apart from its contemporaries was its absolute realism and true depiction of the rise of the Sicilian mob in New York circa early twentieth century. Vito Carleone (Marlon Brando) right at the start of the film in the opening sequence at his daughter's wedding portrayed a man of few words, and the subtle presence of considerable danger.  As the undertaker requests the Godfather's help to avenge his daughter's beating, Carleone appears puzzled. He asks, "Why do you not ask for my friendship? Why have I not been invited for coffee at your home with your wife? Only now, when you need something, do you come to me? Why is this?" These people are no mere thugs. The Sicilian tribal warfare and their absolute `will to power' has been going on for a thousand years. Carleone knew that the undertaker needed his strong arm and influence. But he pulled the undertaker into his world: first demanding respect, then telling the desperate man that when he was needed for a favour, he would be there. Thus the deal was done. He was now part of the family.   Godfather Part 1 is a beautiful film and a graphic depiction of violence and the culture of the early American-Sicilian. We see the fall of Vito Carleone and the unexpected rise of his son, Michael, (Al Pacino) as he avenges the attempted assassination of his father. Michael becomes the Godfather and Part 1 brilliantly comes to a close.  Most film critics at the time of Part 2's release praised the picture and lauded its acting and skilful storytelling. Part 2 moves from preset time to the past, revealing Vito Carleone's humble beginnings, played with brutal skill by Robert DeNiro. What is interesting is the central motif of the tale is of the son becoming the father -(the fathers sins become the sons) Michael was never meant to do the family business. He was an ethical young man, obeying his father's wish by becoming a lawyer, but joining the army. (Against his wishes) Michael's transformation from an innocent to a cold-blooded Godfather is astounding.   Godfather Part 3, though nominated for seven academy awards, was a critical failure. However this writer disagrees, as the story focuses on Michael's success and his reflections about his life. He knew what he had done, including the murder of his own brother, and wanted some kind of redemption. He tries to make everything right, but he finally pays the ultimate price: the closing scenes of the film are one of the most heart wrenching and dramatic in cinematic history. Pacino should have won the Oscar that year, but again they passed him by until many years later.  The Godfather Trilogy is a collection of quality filmmaking that should be part of anyone's DVD library because the story continues to resonate and will continue to do so for a long time.   
 This is definately a greaat starter to a new great series of warrior books. In this thrilling book instead of firestar being the main character, Brambleclaw becomes a choosen one to fulfill a new prophesy. Also, another member of thunderclan, Squirlpaw (one of Firestar's daughters) insists on coning along on a journey that involves one cat from each clan to go on. 
 I won't go into plot and character details, you can read the other reviews for that.  I will tell you that I am way too close to 50 years old and Superman is one of my dearest cherished childhood memories ... and still my Hero.  This vision of Superman, as opposed to Smallville or other retellings of the comic mythology, is simply my favorite.  Superman is a Good Guy.  He has come to grips with his alter-persona and he IS what he IS.  The directors, artists, writers, and voice actors of this series were always dead-on.  A little humor, a touch of science-fiction, and ACTION!  Rememeber, Superman was the product of ACTION Comics.  Enjoy yourself and share these stories with your kids 
 i liked this monitor a lot.  the picture is good.  it's also light enough for me to carry.  it was easy to hook up.  i have had sony monitors before and liked them 
 You get to be different animals. It is a really cool game. I recommend it to other kids to buy. The cheetah get shoot bow and arrows 
 I first heard this album when I found it amongst the "heavy rotation" CDs at my college radio station.  I had no idea who Tim Buckley was or that he was in any way popular.  The very first song I selected to play was "Happy Time" and I was absolutely floored by the beauty of the song and, especially, of his voice.     It is sad that he can be lumped together with so many other fantastic artists in the rock-and-roll drug-overdose roster.  But what output he had in his short time on this earth!  His melodies are soulful and his singing is superb and unique.  You'll not mistake his voice for any other.  If you enjoy Cat Stevens or any other great singer/songwriters, you will truly enjoy Tim Buckley.  All the songs are good on this album, especially "Happy Time", "Song to the Siren" and "Ashbury Park".     If this is just his B-sides and unreleased tracks, I can't imagine what the music that *was* picked for albums sounds like!  I can't wait to get them all 
 As others have noted, Arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball "My Man Godfrey" genre. It is an effectively told, outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies.  However, without Sir John Gielgud (a gentleman who truly deserved the knighthood), the film's faults would be much more apparent. He elevates every scene he is in with his impeccable refinement and a wit that is sharpened to perfection. He is the pillar in a film which desperately needed credibility.  And the title song is a classic.  
 The book is an excellent introduction to the Persian Empire; the world's first true empire. From developing new forms of political administration, building roads that would inspire Rome, fromulating monotheism and fostering cultural tolerance, the Persians were innovators in every sense of the word. Sadly this world is all too often forgotten or only mentioned in passing. This is an excellent beginning for anyone interested in the history of Iran, whose people trace their roots- both ethnically and culturally- to the world of ancient Persia 
 This is a very good guide to the development of your own virtual human.  Peter Plantec is very clever in describing both the general implications of this technology (based on his experience as a psychologist), and the technical details of some simple implementations.  He writes in a very understandable way, even for people without specific knowledge.  The book includes also a CD, containing some useful demo material 
 My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES this book.  Every night before we go to bed, she asks to read "Peanut butter, Peanut butter".  She's already learned the rhymes, I say a part, and she knows when she needs to chime in!  I also love Nadine Bernard Westcott's illustrations -- I've begun to search for and buy all of her books!  Truly enjoyable for both the child and the adult! 
 I have been reading these mysteries from the very first book, it was a nice change to have the book read to me. The book was well read except for some for the pronunciations of some of the famous and infamous locales. I admit I cringed every time I heard Susan Ericksen say Ghirardelli Square.  The characters have evolved nicely over the years and I highly recommend this book, personally I love the audio cd's during my commute to and from work 
 Before i read this book,little i know that this book could be a fast moving mystery book.the book is about a mystery surrounding one family of a poor woman who has been convicted with murder.but for the obvious reason(whodunnit),she is the most unlikely person to kill the victim...and the story goes on how hercule poirot investigates the murder to assist an innocent party....this book must be put on your upper shelf!! 
 Despite the curmudgeonly comments of previous reviewers, I think this book is terrific.  I didn't expect detailed histories of specific cases - I would read other books for that - and found the overview very interesting.  True crime books tend to be very controversial - somebody always thinks the facts aren't correct, whether or not they are - and this one seems to be no exception.  For newcomers to the subject, this is a great place to start - smoothly written text and excellent photos 
 I agree with the the American who wrote that Linda Ronstadt's version are not as good as practically any Mexican artist who has performed these same songs. I also agree with him that this does not take anything away from her, but that we need to face the facts that it is hardly the same thing. What he said was anything but racist. He was simply defending things Mexican, and in a very nice way and a very reasonable way. I think this person who claims to be in Mexico City and speak for Mexicans is really neither. He is not in Mexico or he would not make these statements, and he does not speak for us. We do not agree with anything he is saying. I lived and studied in the US, and I appreciate what Linda has done by putting Mexico on the map as far as our music goes. But I also feel, as the previous reviewer suggests, that fans should, once they have heard this music, go out and buy the real thing. Linda certainly sings her heart out, but she has trouble with the rhythm, for instance. She does best when she is singing duets with the singers ffom the mariachi bands, who have this music in their blood. The arrangements, it seems, have been altered to reflect her failings in this department, essentially, and for those who have heard better versions of these songs, that effect is not pleasing at all. I give her credit for her effort, and I applaud what she has done, and basically I like this album, but not as much as I do more authentic recordings. So let us not be deceived by all of the this childish namecalling by what appears to be one gringo trying to masquarade as Mexican in order to level very absurd accusations at another one who is being completely honest and who obviously knows what he is talking about. I believe that if Linda herself were to see this series of comments here, she would very much weigh in on the side of the first reviewer and find these misplaced accusations of racism to be a shameful embarrassment. All of that RIGHT HERE IN MEXICO pander is simply scurrilous. I can tell that person who is saying that is a gringo - anyone could see that - and he is saying things that no Mexican could ever agree with. Let's talk about the merits of this music, and not get sidetracked with this foolishness, please. The album is good, but it should just be a steppingstone better things for those who are introduced to this music by the laudable efforts of Linda. And, again, I would bet my life that she agrees with me on that. Does anyone think that she would have such hubris as to compare herself to Lola? I don't think so 
 My granddaughter enjoyed this book so much, that we have it out more than the Library has it in stock. One of the librairians is a neighbor and we had been to the library that day and we searched high and low for this book, to no avail. That evening the neighbor came with book in hand, and my 2 1/2yr old granddaughter was so excited to get her book back, she claims. She can't read but knows it by heart 
 This is a valuable book for the layperson and professional, for the understanding of the complexities and properties of vitamins and minerals. However this book is now 10 years old and showing signs of age, and would benefit from a significant update, as some of the information is no longer applicable.   The section called "Understanding Fats and Oils" is probably the weakest link in the chain for this book, and the reader would be well guided to ignore this section. This is a shame because the effect of lipids on the human body is profound in terms of health benefits. To replace this section, the reader would be wise to read the publications written by Dr Mary Enig and Canadian Udo Erasmus, who are two of the leading research experts on the subject of fats and oils.   Also in this encyclopedia the section on cholesterol is also inaccurate.  Better to read the books written on cholesterol by Swedish Dr Uffe Ravnskov, as well the recent book by Fitness Expert Anthony Colpo on cholesterol.   However as I mentioned before, this is an excellent encyclopedia, and I greatly look forward to a future update from the author to replace my well worn copy. Also a hard cover would be nice and I dont mind paying the extra cost.  Whilst paperback is fine for books you read just once, hard cover is better suited to a reference book like this encyclopedia 
 From ABC's 20/20 The book surprised me and was hard to put down.  He talks about his beginnings. As being considered heroic.  And now after his book a scourge and a threat.  John gives us what he has really uncovered.  Better than the show.  But John, why did you except the insurance money for your beach home?                                                                
 What a wonderful book! Tim is very helpful and very funny! I like the fact that he shares some of his blunders because we all like to know we're not the only ones to make mistakes and his advice is sound, kind and real......Christlike. :o} He is a very genuine young man and a great teacher as well.Get this book 
 Most books from the Ivory Tower about community organizers tend to leave out the human side of things.  Instead, Warren makes such efforts come alive on a human level.  Not only does he capture the challenges the group faces, he captures the story.  He lets the organizers speak directly to the reader.  As more and more of the nation's big cities become "majority minority," we will  need books like this one that address head-on thorny issues of cross-racial cooperation.  Bottom line:  it's a very entertaining read 
 Mr. Oberg, an internationally recognized expert on the Russian (FSU) space program, provides an excellent description of the triumphs of the Soviet space program.  The story is fascinating, and the author clearly respects his subjects.  What's special about Oberg, though, is his perspective on Soviet affairs.  He is also a scholar of Russian studies, and rather than simply recounting historical data and technical details of the Soviets' space efforts, he also outlines the details of the political realities which the space program faced.  It makes a nice companion to studies of the US space program.  Highly recommended 
 An excellent selection of texts--from the "Response" to the long poem "First I Dream" to some wonderful short poems and the "loa" or dramatic prologue to the drama "The Divine Narcissus."  Margaret Peden's translations are fluent and readable, and the Spanish is on facing pages so you see the original easily.  Ilan Stavans' introduction is very helpful, giving the facts of Sor Juana's life (insofar as known), the complexities of the situation that the "Response" addresses, and some help with the context and conventions of her poetry.  Sor Juana is an astounding writer--her subtlety and complexities unfold more and more as you read and reflect on her writings.  The "Response" is a rhetorical complex defense of her position as a "learned" woman, gathering the rhetorical authority to defend herself out of the very sources (the Bible, church teachings) that were used to attack her and turning the persona under which her Bishop attacked her (a letter pretending to be by a fellow nun) into a deft weapon against him.  She articulates a tradition of women's learning and turns a seemingly self-effacing self-limitation to the "philosophy of the kitchen" into a far-reaching claim to a unique female source of knowledge.  The "loa" presents dramatically the complex interaction between a colonizing and colonized culture, native language and a Spanish that is becoming at home in the New World, and a native religion which is not simply abandoned for Catholicism but already contains truths which Catholicism confirms and validates even in the process of converting it.  She is one of the great writers of the Seventeenth Century and especially interesting in relation to contemporary multicultural identities and cultural interactions. 
 the begining was quite good as was the ending i think the book descibed to many scenes from the tv series word for word i could stop while i was reading and know exactally what was coming other that that great book fills some holes in from max's past and shocked me one more than one ocasio 
 AS ALWAYS, GRISHAM KEEPS THE ACTION GOING, COULDNT PUT IT DOWN.  LOVED IT 
 its a good software, it works good and keep the computer safe from spam, virus, and some others malware, try it 
 I just finished reading The Thin Pink Line and loved it. I couldn't put it down. I laughed out loud numerous times at Jane's antics and somewhat skewed reasoning. Who in their right mind would consider faking a whole pregnancy? lol Apparently Jane. Heroine Jane Taylor now falls into the category of Bridget Jones and Becky Bloomwood for me, ones I can't get enough of. Although Jane says and does things that most sane people would never consider, if she acted any differently the book probably would not be as entertaining or enjoyable. Jane is one of those characters you root for, although at times you might want to shake her and ask what in the world is she thinking. All in all I enjoyed every minute of this book. I was dying to know how it all ended, so the cliff hanger ending was a shock. Thank goodness I am reading this book now, when the sequel has already been released. Had I read it when the sequel was still unreleased I probably would have been cursing Lauren for a year. lol  I will promptly be getting a copy of the sequel, Crossing the Line, to see what crazy scheme our heroine cooks up next and to see how she comes clean to her family and friends. I also have high hopes that she gets the guy in the end. :)   
 This book is an incredible follow-up in the ever-compelling tale of the bay area's own Jane Candiotti!! Our favorite sleuth IS BACK and can't seem to pull herself away from the mystery and mayhem that surrounds San Francisco. Clyde Phillips does it again with this compelling page-turner where we find Jane embroiled deeper in murder and intrigue as well as her own personal battles. A MUST READ!! 
 What an odd man.   You have to wonder, what sort of literate man travels around the world (three times) in the late 17th century, sacking towns, cavorting with pirates, capturing merchant ships and then sits down to maintain a journal of flora, fauna, wind patterns, and social customs?  The Prestons have presented us with a narrative biography of this strange man. A man who seemingly mixed equally with pirates, lord of the Admiralty and kissed the hand of the queen. A celebrated author, accomplished navigator, respected naturalist and active enough to board enemy ships or cut logwood. A little more art in his soul and we would acknowledge him as a renaissance man. As expected the book centers on Dampier's life from about 1674 to 1715 when he died; it covers the three trips around the world and his short periods of life in England while writing his books. The authors add a few digressions to cover associated world events, framing Dampier's life and giving perspective to his actions or troubles.   While I disagree with a couple of the authors' statements on piracy (having read my share on the subject), I found their work to be enjoyable reading and worthy of a prominent place in my reference material on piracy. P- 
 So, I'll admit it, I am addicted to Suzanne Brockmann books.  I love her storylines and absolutely adore her Navy Seal hero's.   I actually got into Suzanne with "The Unsung Hero" from the other Seal series she has going but decided to pick this up when I saw it was reissued.  I loved this book.  I laughed and at times I got a little sad, especially towards the end when the loyalty, commitment and just love between Joe "Cat" and Blue really became apparent.  I loved the interaction between Joe and "Ronnie". They were such a great couple.  The chemistry was great and I enjoyed the storyline as well.  I really enjoyed this story and would definitely recommend this book to anyone that is looking for an all around entertaining story 
 Uriah Heep, one of the many wonderful seventies bands at it's best.  From "The wizard", the push of "Easy Livin'", the exquisite metal feeling of "Rainbow Demon" to the beautiful and melancolic "Circle of Hands", the great Heep fills our ears with some of the essential music that any rock lover and record collector should have.  A must.      
 It's no denying Peter Carey is a brilliant writer. His flair for pin-pointing the nuances of the good old Aussie vernacular is spot-on, and his characters are always society's off-cuts, but ultimately likeable souls.  Theft: A Love Story was a highly enjoyable and recommended read. But unlike his brilliant True History of the Kelly Gang, it seems that Carey wasn't sure how to end this wonderful tale, and lets it fizzle out rather than leave you with the same enthusiasm you had for it in the beginning 
 Registered dietitian and motivational specialist Jill Fleming presents Thin People Don't Clean Their Plates: Simple Lifestyle Choices For Permanent Weight Loss is not a get-thin-quick fix, or a fad diet, but rather a straightforward guideline to making permanent changes in one's lifestyle and one's body. Restrictive diets don't work as a long-term weight-loss solution, because they cause the body to enter a fasting mode that burns fewer calories. What does work long term is balanced nutrition instead of just cutting out foods, a lifelong commitment to exercise - even simple exercises that can be done while driving a car - and a sincere commitment to treating one's physical body better overall. Highly recommended for anyone striving to make positive improvements in their weight management and overall physical health. 
 I got a copy from the local library, read it, then ordered a copy for my collection. It's well-written and difficult to put down once you get started. Buy it 
 Ted Dekker refuses to let you down.  Good thing too!  Obsessed is another edge of your seat read.  Even though there is a whole lot of rage and obsession throughout this book, the ending result is very uplifting.  Great characters and a fantastic storyline of hope, love, and never giving up.  Another Ted Dekker classic 
 Dumas' profound knowledge of French history is amazing. When reading his books, one should always look beyond the plot and read between the lines. He describes the era of intrigues and struggle for power in such a fascinating, colorful and dramatic way that one can only wonder at his talent. What is the aim of any book, anyway? Dumas' readers become part of his stories. The wit with which he puts history down on paper truly makes him one of the greatest historians of all times

 I have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review.  The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do.  I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle, and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke.  If this happens, I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I'm not entering anything in a competition!  Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color.  
 On the outside the conheads is a bitingly funny movie about the conehead family and their pursuit of the American dream.  We see the family progress through many milestones as they move from a trailer home to a nice suburban home.  In addition to this we see the Conehead's take on parenting while their daughter begins dating the promiscuous Chris Farley.  On the inside however this movie is about something that is very pertinent issue especially in todays political climate, illegal imigration.  During the movie the director forces you to ponder our countries policies on the topic of immigration.  So in summary watch the movie, laugh, but never forget the issue at the heart of the movie 
 Since I began studying Spanish, Isabel Allende has become one of my favorite authors. In this dazzling novel she does it again. Ines Suarez, the protagonist, an old lady, is trying to set down the tumultuous story of her life, a life which is intimately entwined with the history of her country. Born in a rural town in a backward part of Spain, she journeys to the New World in search of her missing husband, traces his steps to Peru, learns of his death, and manages to survive as one of the few Spanish women in the new land.  Later she enters into a tumultuous relationship with the ambitious and brilliant Pedro de Valdivia, and follows him in his singleminded pursuit--the conquest of Chile. It's a story of endurance, daring, survival, unimaginable cruelty and horror, miraculous survival, a clash of peoples which can have no happy ending, the building of cities, passionate love, and unbearable, tragic losses. I'll say no more. You just have to read the book.  Author Allende writes in her inimitable style--lucid and flowing--that draws the reader in with an unusual sense of intimacy. I found it easy to follow in spite of many words that aren't in my Spanish dictionary. The character of Ines is compelling--a powerful, gifted woman who refused to abide by the stereotyped roles of her time. Amazingly, Allende is able to convey the sweep of history, a story that extends over more than fifty years, without losing that sense of personal connection. I don't know how she does it. Sometimes the feminist message of this book is almost overdone--almost, but not quite. A genius like Allende gets some latitude. I recommend this book highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.    
 This book is so easy and fun to read!  A shear joy!  There is so much detail and great stories in this book.  Stuff we have never seen before.  Anyone who likes this book should also read J.D. Landis' LONGING 
 Williams trumps his masterful classic "Mahayana Buddhism" with an even better book. This is vastly superior to any previous effort (David Kalupahana, eat your heart out!). Williams has a superb talent for explicating difficulty ideas with clarity and simplicity, and his prose has a pleasant and inviting tone. He is also completely up to date on the state of current specialized scholarship, so even those readers already endowed with a good grasp of the development of Buddhist philosophy will find an abundance of interesting material here. This book is destined to be a classic 
 This rather short work provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of America's great victory over Japan at the Battle of Midway.  Despite our victory, many young lives were squandered due to poorly designed torpedos, a lack of training, and plenty of corruption and incompetence at the manufacturing stage of weapons production.  Before the Battle of Midway, just a few months after America's defeat at Pearl Harbor, America had just come through the Great Depression, and the Navy had little money to develop and perfect torpedo bombing.  This piece does a very good job of explaining how it came to be that the torpedo squadrons launched against the Japanese at the Battle of Midway achieved not a single hit against the Japanese, and were themselves slaughtered by the Japanese Zero fighters and by flak.  This book is a cautionary tale as to why we owe it to our fighting forces to insist that the weapons with which we equip them are tested, and that they work.  This was not done at Midway as regards the Torpedo Squadrons.  The torpedos were terribly designed, almost none of the men had ever even launched a torpedo (some had never even flown with a torpedo attached to an airplane) and the Navy had developed no real tactics for attacking ships with torpedo planes.  The result was disaster, that was rescued by the very competent dive-bombers, which won the Battle of Midway for the US Navy, vindicating prewar emphasis on dive-bombing tactics against ships.   Another thing that comes out in this work is the courage and heroism of the men of the torpedo planes.  They knew that their chances of survival were poor.  But they gave the battle their all.  Depending on the account, it seems that the constant (disorganized) attacks by the American torpedo planes (which, thanks to Commander Waldron, located the Japanese first) kept the Japanese on the defensive until the American dive-bombers ended Japan's naval superiority for all time, by sinking three Japanese carriers in a matter of minutes.  This book also contains many anecdotes of the time, about what it was like to be a Naval aviator in the World War Two Navy, the relationships between officers and enlisted men, and the like.  This is a well-written and authentic piece.  A fine work.  Readable and recommended 
 I liked this DVD so much that I purchased VOL II. The pace is very good, and if you have a partner, you can be salsa dancing within moments. I also ordered another DVD, but was unsatisfied due to the slow pace. I don't think that this would be good for someone who has never listened to salsa before. As the title says, it is the QUICK and DIRTY guide to Salsa. I think that they assume that those who purchase it have at least some knowledge/interest in dancing in general, and have at least some sense of rhythm.   Either way, I'd definitely recommend it...Great Buy, Great Instruction, Great Fun 
 The illustrations are really what make this book special.  My 7 year old didn't find it scary enough to be cool, though he looked interested as we read it, but my 5 year old thought it was funny.  This is a nice story  about three friends having a surprising Halloween adventure, just right for  children who like Halloween to be just a little spooky, not frightening 
 I wore out one fountain pen on this book.  Bob Gates has served his  country, and five presidents, as earnestly and capably as anyone might, and  there is much to learn from this book.  The level of detail is quite good.   He is very critical of the Directorate of Operations for both misbehavior  and a lack of management control in relation to Central America, and as one  who was there I have to say, he is absolutely right.  We disagree on the  point of intelligence (he would say, "secrets for the president",  I would say "knowledge for the Nation") but I believe we would  agree on this: intelligence is important, and intelligence merits deep and  sustained interest by the President 
 This is the only guide you need to buy when you are planning a trip to the Philippines.  The author is the same person who wrote the first 6 editions of Lonely Planet Philippines, which used to be the best guide on the Philippines, but if you are like so many people who are disillusioned by the 7th edition, buy this book.  The book is well researched and not as biased as other guide books 
 Once again it is another good read by Grisham. It is hard to think what my will would be like if I get over a million dollars. I cannot see leaving it to a woman in some remote southn american jungle 
 This book was very informative.  It explained a lot of things going on in this world that I didn't or couldn't understand before.  A must read for everyone! 
 Wow what a great book to read to the two - five year old set that they can look back on at an older age with fond memories.  Cute story but the illustrations are what will keep kids looking through the book for years to come.  Sendak does a great job of creating "wild things" that are somehow a little bit monster like yet cuddly and loveable.  And of course our Max knows the magic trick of how to become king of them all. So let the wild rumpus start.  You'll still be home in time for a hot supper!  
 finnagans wake is not comprehensible. it is not like reading or watching a film. Mr.Joyce spoke over a dozen languages fluently and this book is in English and french and Swahili and Italian and Latin, Greek AND mostly in his own language which is kindof like English. it is not understandable because some many words are derivative of others, the characters are always changing and the story is circular. It took a quarter of a lifetime to write and may well take that or longer to grasp. it also has many meanings depending on your perspective. One-review claims it is contains the recipe for making an atomic bomb, oh well. Campbell and Robinson have done just what they say- given the reader a skeleton- you supply the body and sole. A marvelous book to read and extremely helpful bones to knaw 
 I havent read the Threasure Island book by Robert Louis Stevenson yet but I saw this Treasure Island movie and I liked it and thought it was a great movie and I thought that Wallace Beery was superb as the pirate Long John Silver and the rest of the cast was very good too, including Jackie Cooper as Jim Hawkins. I really think it's a shame that this hasn't been put on DVD yet and I really think it's about time that it was transferred to DVD 
 I highly recommend this book for anyone who is going through the painful experience of a loved one's dying process.  There are many stories and guidelines for making their transition from life to death a more comfortable and valuable experience, and will also help you to cope better.  I first encountered "Final Gifts" when a friend loaned it to me after the death of my father--while it was too late for him, it helped me understand what had happened, and I was better prepared to handle the death of my mother, less than two years later.  Because of this book, my brother, sister, and I felt we had done everything we could for our mother, and it allowed us to feel a definite sense of peace both during that time, as well as after she died.   Please don't allow the occasional repetitiveness of the book stop you from reading it all the way through--the authors are well aware of the shock and confusion that you may be experiencing, and the redundancies are there to make sure that the message penetrates your grief.    Many blessings on the authors for writing such a priceless book!     
 This is an excellent book for the individual who is not necessarily familiar with astrology.  It provides entertaining and surprisingly accurate descriptions of personalities based on the individual's sun sign. It is perfect for the person who has friends that ask questions such as "I'm and Aries.  What am I supposed to be like?" With this book in hand, you can tell them - in a humourous, unoffensive way 
 I like the overall point of this book. I also agree with a lot of the stuff he teaches in regards to using real estate and owning your own business as the only true way to get superb rates of returns. However, he does make one huge assumption in the real estate section that is not clear: that you can rent a house for the same cost as your expenses. This may work in some cheaper areas, but in the places where houses have skyrocketed in price, expecting to get a high enough rent to cover all the fees is not realistic for some major areas. Also, he makes it sound like getting 150k is easy for a salary. Unfortunately for those of us in stable "normal" fields like engineering, nursing, accounting, etc... asking for a 30% raise would get you a lot of laughs at best. Nonetheless, I would still recommend it to other new grads 
 I love her magazine and her cookbooks and view on life. Lidia rocks. Its like your grandmother telling you all the little things you need to know to be a great cook. Thanks Lidia...you rock!! 
 I absolutely LOVE this double CD!  There are some duplicate songs however the ones off of the Headkeeper are live versions, which is fine by me.  I have been listening to this CD non-stop since I got it and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone interested in Dave Mason.  The live Feelin' Alright is wonderful and funky.  This Cd will be in heavy rotation on my 12 disc CD players so BUY IT NOW, you will not be disappointed.   
 For those with architectural leanings, Gloria Koenig's Iconic LA  offers tales and black-and-white pictures pertaining to a baker's dozen of Los Angeles's most memorable buildings, the Hollywood Bowl, Grauman's Chinese Theater, and the Getty Center, among them. Part guidebook, part urban history, Iconic includes compact entries that reveal as much about the architectural details - like the fact that Pierre Koenig's glassed-in modernist masterpiece Case Study House #22 was assembled in a single day - as they do about the people behind them. Who knew that Paul Williams, the architect who designed the space-age Theme Building at LAX, was African American? The book has the breezy quality of a Hollywood bio, with the buildings as stars 
 Good chapter in an interesting series. I like the fact that that focus is on the job and the challenges it has in addition to drawing on past episodes in his life so that it show his influences and the consequences of past actions. Also the writers have a secret agenda of persons unknown that gives it some mystery. The is he gay or not storyline has moved from being amusing to annoying however. I will buy further issues - it is more than just beating up the villan of the week - there is a broader context missing in other graphic novels. 
 I'm not the kind of person who has planned her wedding since she was six years old.  My family is not religious, we do not have our own traditions, and I really had no idea what I wanted to do for my ceremony.    I liked this book because it provided a lot of options.  It showed vows for a handful of different religious, from the traditional Protestant vows, to ethical humanists, to Buddhists.  I especially liked that it had a wide selection of readings that were not from the Bible, including some really beautiful Native American prayers, and some of Shakespeare's sonnets.  Selections for music were good as well, although not quite as helpful to me since they are so many good lists available for free online.  There were some places I wish the book was a little more descriptive, though.  For example, the description of how the Unity candle is used within the ceremony could not have been more vague.  I would have liked more information on how things like this are actually staged.  Still, a very useful starting point 
 Coleman Barks once again translates the words of Rumi with respect, good nature, a bit of humor, and a deep understanding of this 13th century mystic and poet.  A renowned poet and something of a mystic himself, Coleman Barks leads us through his book as a constant and caring companion.  He begins each chapter with his own touching stories, guidance, and expert explanations for the material he lays out.  One simply cannot come away from this book without having some sincere appreciation for the devotion and dedication Coleman Barks has for another poet's words.  In "Rumi: The Book Of Love: poems of ecstasy and longing", we are led deep into the regions of the soul, where love is both Universal and Divine.  It is a love that beckons us to shed our own image and concepts of ourselves, in exchange for a love that is so vast and joyful, its eloquence can only be experienced rather than explained.  How can we know the divine qualities from within?  If we only know through metaphors, It's like when children ask what sex feels like and you answer, "Like candy, so sweet." (88)  Rumi seems to realize mankind is comprised of many faiths, and he mentions many of them with dignity and respect.  Yet Rumi's own experience takes him beyond religion, even his own.  He often exchanges the word "God" with "Friend", and refers to himself and others who have achieved his enlightened state as "Lovers".  Rumi's words and sublime wisdom ring true for us, as he shares his knowledge of the God-Friend in a both Universal and personal message.  We are extremely fortunate to have the poetry of this selfless and compassionate mystic reach us through the fragile, and often forgetful, span of time.  Because through Rumi's poetry, we seem to hear our own soul's call and longing to gently open like a beautiful and fragrant flower, and laugh with a tender and colorful sweetness.  There is some kiss we want with our whole lives, the touch of spirit on the body (33)  ~Brian Douthit author of "Perfectly Said: when words become art" 
 this is the best play i have had the chance to act out! i agree that it is not for those who hate people different from them! but it is a perfect synopisis of how people viewed that type of life in that time period. i am martha in the play and i think that everyone should see or read the play. i think is is great! 
 One of the principles the USA was founded upon was the freedom of speech; no government entity can restrict the freedom of expression of a private individual.  This however does not preclude government agencies from sponsoring their own speech, or supporting those whose speech reflects favorably on the actions of said agency.  This latter intrusion of government into the mass media can be as harmful to society if not more so than outright censorship, primarily because it is less overt and more excusable.    This book deals with one form of such government - sponsored speech; the US military providing support to movie producers to make movies as long as the movies reflect favorably on the US military.  The book gives a thorough and carefully-cited history of how Hollywood works with various branches of the US military to help get movies made.  In turn, the military branch(es) in question have a say over the movie script, including the right to censor or rewrite entire scenes.  The US military helps by providing access to military hardware, installations, and sometimes personnel to movie makers working on military movies.  The result is often movies biased towards the US military, with a subtle goal of increasing recruitment.  Products of this arrangement include Top Gun, Black Hawk Down, and Stripes.  The unfortunate result is that parts of military life or military history that should be known are rewritten, whitewashed, or sometimes ignored altogether.  This includes abuse of war prisoners by US servicemen, rapes of innocent women in and around battlefields by US servicemen, and substance abuse within the military.     This arrangement is supported at multiple levels in both Hollywood and the US government.  In Hollywood, directors, producers, studio companies, and actors and actresses take part in this symbiosis.  In the US government, soldiers, field officers, staff officers, and presidential administrative staff also take part in this symbiosis.    There are however, those who refuse to play by these rules.  Two examples cited in the book are Kevin Costner and Oliver Stone.  The military refused to support Costner's production of Dances With Wolves because the script shows US soldiers killing Native Americans...during the 1800s!  This shows how ridiculous the censorship process has become.  US soldiers killing Native Americans is a commonly known fact, and should be acknowledged by the federal government.  The US military could have taken the initiative, owned up to their actions, sponsored the movie, and at the end of the movie's credits include an apology for their actions.  Instead, they refused any help whatsoever unless all the scenes between Native Americans and US soldiers were cleaned up to protect the military's image.    Overall, the primary conclusion I got from the book is that to watch Hollywood movies with a little suspicion.  The story you are seeing has probably been tampered with and censored one or more government agencies, often with the purpose of furthering propaganda of one type or another.  Another conclusion I got from reading this book is that ever since 1970, the war movies that have done the best in terms of critical acclaim and Academy Awards have been those completed without military support; Platoon and Apocalypse Now are the two best examples.  In all, I am glad I read this book.  I highly recommend it. 
 We are really good about packing up our meat, vegis and fruit right after purchase. Our vacuum sealer has saved us tons of money just from not tossing out stuff that goes bad quickly. The sealer came with rolls to make our own bags, but I found it too cumbersome; these bags eliminate the difficulty.  
 A fabulous ending to over 20 years of letter writing.  Penpals of sorts.  A must read for anyone, but writers it can tear down any writers block you could possibly have.  She is so articulate and real.  I highly suggest this book 
  Many of us have searched for years for answers to basic questions about why we are here in this life and how should we conduct ourselves. Miguel Ruiz presents the most direct, simple, and yet profound answers to these questions. Thank you Miguel Ruiz. He has shown me that I can look within, using what he calls "the second attention," to find my own personal truth. His description of how we are "domesticated" into the Dream of the Planet, and the path to take to free ourselves from being controlled in our lives by that old dream, has freed me to live a much more authentic life 
 When my friend passed this book on to me, I was expecting a historical novel with dialogue and romance. However, I was pleasantly surprised by a nonfiction story woven from documents, letters, and research. I have always loved maps and been intrigued with how early naturalists figured out details about nature, so this book was a page-turner for me. I couldn't put it down. It was amazing what this team endured to collect data for information that we learn in elementary school today. It also gives insight and context to some of modern day political and social issues. 
 If you're looking for a pure straight up, no nonsense, balls to the wall, thrashing, headbanging assault that will leave your ears bleeding and shattered and your brain smashed against the concrete wall, well you've come to the right place with Swedish thrash metal merchants The Haunted's self titled debut album. I went out and bought this album over the weekend, and of course being a fan of these guys, I was quickly hooked to this album right after the first listen. This album has absolutely everything: Angry brutal hardcore style vocals, raging thrashing guitar riffs, brutal slamming drums, what more can you ask for. Peter Dolving's hardcore style vocals are just angry, brutal, and vicious beyond words. Anders Bjorler and Jensen deliver a barrage of lightning fast heavy guitar riffs that thrash and slam throughout and awesome solos that are just smokin. Jonas Bjorler's bass lines are solid and audible, and Adrian Erlandsson's drumming is fast, brutal, and absolutely slamming throughout. The opening track and my favorite on here "Hate Song", is just pure bliss, and it will immediately have you hooked to this album throughout. Other favorite songs on here include "Chokehold", "In vein", "Bullet Hole", "Chasm", "Blood Rust", "Shattered", "Undead", and "Soul Fracture". Actually ever song on here rocks hard. So anyways, if you're a fan of At The Gates, Carnal Forge, Lamb Of God, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, Slayer, Sepultura, or even Pantera for that matter, you will definately like The Haunted. So do yourself a big favor, go buy this album now, I guarantee you'll love it. The Haunted Rules!! 5 stars all the way. Jeremy's song ratings: 1. Hate Song - 5/5 (Favorite Song) 2. Chasm - 5/5 3. In vein - 5/5 4. Undead - 5/5 5. Chokehold - 5/5 6. Three Times - 5/5 7. Bullet Hole - 5/5 8. Now You Know - 5/5 9. Shattered - 5/5 10. Soul Fracture - 5/5 11. Blood Rust - 5/5 12. Forensick - 5/5  
 I am sad to admit that I'd never heard of this book until I was loaned it by a roommate, but fortunately it was well worth the wait and one of the best literary surprises I've read recently. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is a larger than life, disheveled and slightly deranged man who haunts the French Quarter of New Orleans and the rest of the cast, each an absurd caricature in their own right, mingles with each other in very funny and unexpected ways.   While the characters and their hijinx certainly propel the story along, just as imporant as the people who inhabit New Orleans is the city itself, with its quirks and originality on full display. It is a wonderful and loving reminder of the pre-Katrina hedonistic, lively New Orleans, but at same time the author does not hide the racism, segregation and other problems from which they city also suffered. This was one best depictions of a place I've ever read.   Finally, the author also does a brilliant job of pacing the story and bringing everything in it full circle, just as Ignatius had been predicting all along in his discussions of Fortuna. It was a very clever trick that can not fully be described, in a short review, but alone makes this story worth reading.  A Confederacy of Dunces is a fantastic, lively, and hilarious book which is loose and frenzied, but it is written with fantastic structure. I would highly recommend it for people who like a good laugh, New Orleans or enjoyable fiction, but also people who enjoy reading books through an academic lens. It is very well crafted, but also a lot of fun 
 For far too long, war movies have glamorized an otherwise horrific act... warfare. The reality is it's frightening. It's random. It's uncertain. it's chaotic. It's frantic. It's maddening. It makes men out of boys and turns grown men into crying babies.   Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon and a host of other actors add to an ensemble cast that appear onscreen as if hardened by years of "The Great War."   War has never been so realistic. 
 This is far more than a sports book on perhaps the single greatest sports achievement ever, it is a compelling look at the era itself.  Gary does a wonderful job re-creating the evening and illuminating the racial overtones, the struggling NBA which was a far cry from the wealthy and glitzy league of today, and the fact that this historic game was not televised and only a few thousand fans were in attendance in Hershey, PA, which was not even the home court for either team.  The book meanders through the game one quarter at a time.  Often reflecting back and providing the backdrop on Chamberlain, and the other players, and even provides glimpses into the lives of many of the fans who were there to witness the historic night.  At times the book was perhaps a bit too nostalgic, and some of the time spent on various people not really related to the game were a bit superfluous.  It is really hard imagine several key issues depicted here.  First the racial situation encountered by the players is difficult to read and not feel emotionally angered at the treatment many of the minority players experienced.  The fact that a player could actually score 100 points in a single game is beyond remarkable.  In today's NBA most teams do not score 100 points.  Consider that Wilt Chamberlain averaged over 50 points a game for the entire season, and these are records which will never be broken.  The book is engaging, and well written.  Although perhaps too broad in its scope, it does create the backdrop for the historic night well.  Even if you are only a casual fan of the game, the historical and sociological content alone is worth the read. 
 What a great book! If you liked books like "Bringing Down the House" or "Word Freak", you'll enjoy this one too. I liked it even more on account of the gradual transformation of Finkel's persona from dork to pretty cool guy. I really felt that he was somebody worth rooting for (as opposed to Moneymaker, for example, another unlikely hero, who just seemed like a jerk in his autobiography) Highly recommended read, quick, fun, entertaining 
 George Polti's book tells you about the inner workings of the thirty-six dramatic situations he claims to have found. According to him, the possible plots can be reduced to one of these situations or to a variation on them.  Additionally, he offers specific sub-types to each one of the plots, so  that it is easier to precise which elements will make a distinct kind of  plot. At the end of the book, you will also find useful information on how  every element of a plot can vary. The classical avenger archetypical  figure, for example, can be split into several characters for a different  effect; the object of a passion can be a man or a woman, but it can be  an  addiction too! A book that would-be writers should not miss, "The  Thirty-six Dramatic Situations" will make a good reading even for  those only interested in getting a better grasp of the plot of, say, a  movie they have seen. It is, simply, a work of art 
 Robert Mitchum helped to introduce the psychological western in the landmark film Pursued. In Track of the Cat, he continued to chart new territory for what was already a well-worn genre in 1954.   Track of The Cat, set on Mount Ranier, features Mitchum as the forceful head of a very disfunctional family in the waning days of the 1800's. Mitchum is the middle child, but runs roughshod over his gentle older brother, played by William Hopper (Paul Drake of TV's Perry Mason), and his younger, unconfidant brother, played by 50's heartthrob Tab Hunter. The rest of the family is a spinsterish sister, played by Teresa Wright, (who was in Pursued with Mitchum), and overbearing mother and alcoholic father, played by Beulah Bondi and Philip Tonge. When a mountain lion begins to attach their cattle, Mitchum and Hooper start out on a lion hunt. Back home, Hunter is trying to navigate an uneasy visit by his girfriend, who is welcomed by half the family and disliked by the other half. Much drama and tragedy ensues.  The predominant use of black and white by director William Wellman is very effective, but it would have been wasted without such a great cast. Everyone is excellent, particularly Mitchum, Bondi, and Tonge, who played comic relief with great effect.  This is a great film long overdue on DVD 
 After the Civil War, the Wilder family has decided to make a big move - join the migration to the frontier, from the little cabin in the woods of Wisconsin. The main character and author, Laura, tells about the difficulties and advantages of life on the praire. Even though the journey there is difficult, and, at time, tragic, the family is able to pull through, and arive in the praire of Kansas to make their new life and create their new adventures. This book is a timeless classic. Every child should read this series at some point. It helps children understand praire life, while entertaining them at the same time 
 WARNING - Do not buy Sovereign Grace Publishers Henry Cole translation of Bondage of the Will.  After slogging through 95 pages of its barely understandable jargon, I asked my dad, Pastor Gerry Mohr (LCMS) if Luther's reputation for intellect was, perhaps, a bit unearned.  He replied, "Cole whipped out his translation effort in three months or less.  Luther's original is a direct reply to a work by Erasmus directly aimed against what Luther was teaching.  Cole does not take the time to understand either Erasmus or Luther; he gets a quick job finished. Good translation is not generally done like that.  And Cole does not convey well the arguments and language of Luther in English.    "Read the translation by Packer & Johnston. These translators say, "This edition was originally to have been a revision of Cole's.  It became evident, however, that the tortuous style of this translation so obscured the meaning and force of the original that it was better to attempt a completely new translation, which might more adequately convey the impetuous flow and dialectical strength of Luther's powerful Latin."      "Packer & Johnston (who are Reformed, not Lutheran) say in their introduction, "This, then, is the Luther whom we meet in The Bondage of the Will: a great-hearted Christian warrior; a thorough exegete (he wins the battle of the texts hands down); a profound systematic theologian; and above all, an unflinching defender of the grace of a sovereign God.""   
 This is a beutiful CD with religious Hindu chants. Those interested in the religion would do well to start with this. The chants are all in Sanskrit and have many different mantras etc. which are part of daily Hindu life. I have had this CD for years and is played frequently on different occasions or for no reason at all. Explore away 
 I was very impressed with Mr. Price's first novel!  After reading it in nearly record time (the pages just FLEW!) I highly recommend this novel to anyone 14 or older.   Great characters, a really interesting plot and his warmth and sense of humour all make "Dead Connection" a great read.    As I am an adult (with no teenage kids) I never would have found this book if it weren't for the fact that Charlie was one of my coaches in an executive seminar I attended this Spring. Hopefully, teens who buy this book will pass it along to their parents as it is not only entertaining, but thought-provoking as well.   
 The Adidas Samba has been a great shoe for as long as I can remember.  This is easily my fourth pair over the years because these things wear like iron and last forever.  My last pair were falling apart after several seasons of indoor soccer and general usage. The only way I could bring myself to throw them away was to buy a new pair.  I recommend this shoe to anyone who is looking for grip on turf or a comfortable shoe for any sports activity. 
 In a time when jazz was becoming less popular, this four-part masterpiece recorded in 1964, is John Coltrane's attempt to give thanks to God. In doing so, and regardless of your religious beliefs, he delivers a performance in the company of McCoy Tyner (piano), Jimmy Garrison (bass) and Elvin Jones (drums) that makes it clear what he meant when he said in 1966 he planned "to become a saint" in response to the question about his plans for the next decade. Sadly, he died of cancer not too long after that statement, but he left a legacy of work that -like this album- are testimony of what an inspired soul can let flow and give to others. Today, almost forty years after its original release, Coltrane's memory is alive and kicking and his timeless work continues to inspire musicians of all genres across the world. In my journey of discovery of this beautiful jazz music, this album has turned out to be a true musical revelation and I want to share it with you too 
 I choose read this book the reason, is because manufactures my research paper. Because I am attracted by its theme. I extremely like reading the prose poetry anthology, Edgar lee master's work on happen to conform to my reading need, I in make my research paper time, my English teacher explained for me many about this book meaning, I was not at that time understood very much, because my English proficiency is not very high, but my teacher emphasized had been born of dying, I on by this depth deep attraction, I am tried to read it, I inside discovered the verse extremely only is beautiful, he described many about the life and the romantic love, Respective sound from the grave which possibly honestly finally speaks, is protected by the death shadow. This a series of stories occur in the small town, is matter which the big city cannot occur, all these attract you to explore another different world, although all these let you think not really, but it may purify your mind, lets you feel the different life 
 Three 6 still on top of the rap game. The next album they dropped has loads of great songs and hits like Stay Fly, Stay fly Remix, body parts 3, knock the black of yo a**, don't violate, hard hittaz, hard out here for a pimp and don'tcha get mad. 
 I got the book because there are some bedroom issues between Mars and Venus in my universe.  Talking about the issues doesn't seem to help... especially when I am doing all of the talking.  After perusing the book at the book store, I recognized several situations described in the book that are EXACTLY what we are experiencing.  It is encouraging to know that a) our issues are not unique, but common; b) this author has already seen and dealt with our exact issues in his work with other couples; and c) the solution could be simply communication and understanding each other better.  Why would I NOT buy this book?!    There's nothing earth shattering here.  Just reasonable insight and advice in a short, inexpensive book by a successful author of relationship books.  At best, our sex-life improves dramatically and forever.  At worst, the advice doesn't work for us.  Either way, I think I've learned a few things from this book.    Hey, it's all about understanding and communication.  If you don't want that in your relationship, don't buy the book.  Otherwise, check it out 
 If you really want to know what goes on behind the mic of your favorite radio show, check out this book.  The writing style makes it easy to read and includes everything you need to begin a successful career in radio.  Even if you don't plan on working in the field, there are many funny anecdotes that make it entertaining for everybody.  You can't walk away from this book without having gained a newfound respect for the producers of these shows 
 This is *da book* on "The Dick Van Dyke Show", but it's really far more than that.  It is the finest book on a TV sitcom I've ever come across.  Waldron painstakingly discusses everything you'd ever want to know  about  the show, and he interviewed (seemingly) everyone connected with the  show, including Carl Reiner, Mary Tyler Moore, Dick, Larry Matthews, Rose  Marie, and many of the writers. If you're a DVDS fan, you've gottta have  this tome on hand.  I can't recommend it  highly enough.  I fervently hope  Vince will do subsequent books on "Cheers" and other  sitcoms...he's the ONLY man for the job 
 I read this in the Seventies and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Now I've bought it again and enjoyed it all over again.  Fascinating behind-the-scenes look at TOS.  You have to read this book to understand what a groundbreaking series Star Trek was.  You also learn how grueling a TV series is to work on.  This book is fascinating, and sometimes hilarious 
 This is my second and probably last Lehane book.  It's not bad.  I found it to be worth finishing, so that warrants a weak 4 star rating.  But, I read this book shortly after reading George Pelecanos' latest novel, The Night Gardener, and this one suffers pretty severely in comparison.  Lehane seems to me to lack confidence in his ability to deliver a realistic, believable and still interesting story.  He reaches too far to make his characters and scenes a little cooler, a little more powerful and ultimately a little less true to life.  That's what people want, I suppose, from action thriller books.  But, I'd rather read something I can really see as realistic for crime drama.  This book is not quite that 
 Though I love "Burnin" and "Catch A Fire" just as much  as this one, this album was my introduction to Marley  and holds a special place in my heart!  It was 1981 and I was stationed at Ft. Lewis, Wa.  right outside Seattle. I had two of the hippest roomates  that I could've had!  We all were heavily into music and exchanged ideas,  albums, genres with each other and I expanded  rapidly on my musical expertise!  I was also turned on to "gunga" and guinness stout (yuck!) by a "spliff-smoking" kat (B.D.) who was out of Brooklyn, NY  via Jamaica who used to play this funky but offbeat  to my ear at that time kind of music called reggae!-- Boy, I liked it! Bob Marley was my favorite of these that he played  and a new love affair with another great artist was born!  Buy any Bob Marley and The Wailers album from 1972's "Catch A Fire" to 1980's "Uprising" and you can't miss! R.I.P. Bob Marley!!  
 An absolutely fantastic work of history, covering with the neccessary depth the events and personalities, with a particularly fine analysis of the political background to the war, both in Britain and in South Africa 
 This is a highly readable and expertly written account by Tom Jones about his astronaut career. He writes from his heart, and has clearly thought a lot about how to effectively communicate his experiences. His use of imagery puts this book in the realm of literature, though it is definitely non-fiction. A must for your Christmas list if you are or once were an aspiring astronaut,  an aspiring writer of topics related to space and technology or just interested in knowing what it is like up there.  It is a great read; I laughed, I cried, learned something about space, space policy and history, and was amazed by it all 
 I loved this book! I became a fan of Gail Tsukiyama after reading Women of the Silk and I continue to be a fan at the end of this book. It is so purely and sweetly written. There is not a character that I didnt enjoy. The customs of old Japan was fascinating too. She really captured the aches and the longing of these long suffering people, but it wasn't written with sadness, but hope. This would make a great book club selection 
 What I really liked most about this book is that it was written by someone who actually trades for a living instead of a vendor who makes his living off selling courses, classes, and books. Gary Smith took a $2,000 account which he struggled with for 19 years to a $700,000 account after reading hundreds of trading books. How did he do this? By finally quitting trying to go for the big when and focused on gaining money each month. He really made the big money at first by trading S&P futures then when he got in the 6 figure range he switched to mutual funds only because he can not deal with the volitilitu of individual stocks. This book is like a modern day version of Nicolas Darvas's "How I made $2,000,000" it is the true story of  how an individual broke the trading code. Here are my key learnings:  1. Trade momentum get in when the market moves up and stay in while it continues to go up, run for your life at the first sign of it dropping.  2. Live and breath the market with the help of CNBC, The Wall Street Journal, magazines, books, and some good news letters,  3. Trade what works for you, whether it be stocks, options, futures, etc.  4. Avoid vendorland in the investment world and focus on educating yourself.  5. The stock market has made 40% of its historical gain from November and December. The best days to trade are Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.  6. Position trading is better than day trading.(Staying in over night or the week end).  7. Agonize over your losses and learn from them.  8. Watch for divergences in the S&P, NasdaQ, and Dow, and buy when one runs up past the others.  9. THE MARKET TELLS IT'S OWN STORY BEST.Watch buying momentum.  He has an excellent reading list at the back of the book that will enrich you. I also recommend reading Alexander Elders "Trading for a living" and Van Tharps "Trade your way to Financial Freedom" for a complete picture on how to really trade for a living 
 Metaphorically Selling is a guide to unleashing the powers of metaphors to sell, persuade, or explain anything to anyone. Chapters address why people's brains crave metaphors, and how to construct a metaphor with muscle and avoid bad metaphors (such as the dreaded mixed metaphors, and metaphors that attempt to connect two things that are too far away) and the important follow-up to drive the point home. Further advice covers how to use metaphors to sell, whether advertising a product or ingratiating oneself or driving a point home. An extremely valuable supplement to the personal library of anyone working in careers that involve sales, negotiation, or presentation - the trick is not just to begin with a solid argument, but to word one's case in a way that will have an immediate impact on the listener! 
 Even though this book is now out of print, I still feel the need to write this review in addition to the other excellent one posted here.  Guerrilla Radio is the inspiring story of B92 radio station and their decade long quest to end the regime in Serbia while at the same time offering the public hope.  As a student of international relations, it also offers a fascinating look at what really happens to the resistance fighters without weapons when temporary "interventions" by foreign powers end up making situations much worse than they already were.  If you can get your hands on a copy of this book, BUY IT IMMEDIATELY 
 Book Design And Production: A Guide For Authors And Publishers will enable even the most novice aspirants to publishing an ideal instructional guide to every aspect of book publishing. A pioneer in the use of on-demand printing technology back in 1982-83 when he was in charge of publishing all price lists for a large railroad, and having operated several book design, printing and typesetting businesses for clients which included HarperCollins and McGraw-Hill, Pete Masterson takes the reader through every step of the book creation process. A master at the craft of book creation, Masterson clearly explains why 90% of all designers will prove wrong for a particular title -- and the ten crucial questions to ask when interviewing book designers; why Microsoft Word is a poor layout choice -- but what to do if you end up having to use it anyway; why the wrong fonts can ruin a book -- and how to pick the right ones. Covering both the outside (cover) of a book, as well as its interior design, and thoroughly "user friendly" throughout, Pete Masterson's Book Design And Production is one of those indispensable instructional references that should be on the shelf of anyone seeking to produce their own books so as to be as marketable (and profitable) as possible.  
 This famous adaptation of Ben Johnson is terrific and still modern in its whole conception, this is a characteristic seal of the masterpieces. Aided by his loyal server Mosca. Volpone makes his friend to believe is dying and convinces to every one of his greedy friends is his heir.  As you can guess, the macabre spell and incisive charm of this play still makes laugh and think to a great audience.   In 1939 Maurice Tourneur decided to make a film about it. The tragic new is this film was released after WW2, but Harry Baur, the most complete actor f the French Cinema by then, wouldn't be present, his mysterious death was attributed to Nazis.  If you are looking for one of the best and most genuine jewel of the Universal literature, go for this one. 
        I have to say I love this book! It is awsome! I had heard it was boring, slow getting into, stupid and about everything else bad about it you can think of. Those comments were and are the understatements of the year!           I like this book so much because you can relate and feel like your being the character. I also like it because it has something for everyone for kids their is a young character, for men their is a war story, and for women their is a love story.          The story is strong because it has so much agony and yet the family holds through it all. It holds through death, suffering, and through war.          Overall this book is very wishy-washy but it is good none the less!!!  
 Saul Kripke's "Naming and Necessity" is one of the greatest pieces of analytic philosophy of the twentieth century. It has reshaped philosophy of language and metaphysics, and has significantly influenced philosophy of mind and epistemology, among other areas of philosophy. "Naming and Necessity" is largely a transcription of three lectures that Kripke delivered when he was 29 years old - without lecture notes. The book reflects the informal style of these lectures; it is friendly and engaging, albeit sometimes unclear. Among other things, Kripke refutes descriptivist theories about the meaning and reference of proper names and natural kind terms, and develops a new account in their place; defends the modal concepts of necessity and possibility, and distinguished between necessity and a prioricity; and argues that there are necessary truths knowable only a posteriori and contingent truths knowable a priori. Of course, the book has some critics. However, in my opinion, Kripke does not commit some of the errors of which he has been accused in other reviews here. I think that the book will be very difficult for those unfamiliar with analytic philosophy, especially philosophy of language.  I recommend "Naming and Necessity" for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in philosophy. I also recommend Soames's two-volume "Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century", which culminates with an excellent exposition of the book and its relevance, though these volumes are also difficult for those unfamiliar with analytic philosophy 
 In 1912, before such a thing as science fiction existed as a separate genre, I'm not sure how the serial in All-Story called "Under the Moons of Mars", by "Norman Bean", was received. Probably simply as an adventure story, one that hearkened back pretty clearly to the lost race tales of the likes of H. Rider Haggard. (And to be sure at about the same time Edgar Rice Burroughs was publishing the first of his Tarzan stories, which much more overtly can be placed in the "lost race" lineage.) "Norman Bean", of course, was a pseudonym for Edgar Rice Burroughs, and in 1917 "Under the Moons of Mars" was reprinted in book form as _A Princess of Mars_, under Burroughs' own name.   How necessary is it to describe the plot of _A Princess of Mars_? Briefly, Civil War veteran (for the South) Colonel John Carter and a friend discover a gold mine in Arizona. They run afoul of Indians, and while hiding in a cave, Carter is mysteriously transported to Mars. There he encounters the rather brutish "Green Martians", and is taken captive by them. They are constantly battling each other, and the rather more civilized (and humanoid, though egg-laying) "Red Martians". They capture a Princess of the Red Martians, the beautiful Dejah Thoris. After a rocky start, John Carter and Dejah Thoris fall in love. The leader of the Green Martians plans terrible tortures for them, so it becomes necessary to escape. They become separated, and Carter makes his way to a rival city of Dejah Thoris's. He and a friend plot to undo the dastardly plans of this rival city, and rescue Dejah Thoris's city, which they do in very adventurous fashion. By the end, John Carter has managed to effect positive political change among both the Red Martians and Green Martians, and he and Dejah Thoris are husband and wife, awaiting the hatching of a child, when a crisis in the air-manufacturing plant intervenes.  The whole thing is a wild mess of faintly plausible SFnal ideas, totally ridiculous SFnal ideas, and pure fantasy. Much is absurd, but much is really fun. The writing is rather stilted but occasionally striking. The characters are very stiff. The attitudes are consistent with the time -- the references to Indians are pretty racist, and there is no reason to believe that the Confederate John Carter would be any more admirable in his attitudes toward black people, but on the whole these aspects are much in the background. It can't be regarded as a great book, but it remains appealing 
 Yankee Tinkerer Fred A. Leuchter, Jr., who was the number one manufacturer of execution equipment, stumbled upon something more than he bargained for when the courts in Toronto had him go to Poland and take samples of the alledged 'gas chambers' at the Osweiseim State Museum (formerly known as Auschwitz during WWII). The world finally got to see Historical Revision- ists for what they are; normal people taking an- other look at historical epochs and giving a more sensible opinion about them. There were no 'gas chambers', folkes. This is a very bitter pill for some to swallow, but the truth hurts. Thanks,Fred 
 I love this show and this is a realy good season. With one season to go its all been worth waiting for.It was interesting to hear the weird theme song at the beginning of this season. Jack got his Bistro up and running here and there was quite a few good laughs in the process. Terri was settling in well in this season,her humor was  great.She realy fit in well in this series,had some big shoes to fill. Janet was at her usual witty best.Mr Furly and Larry continued to add a heap of fun to this show. Then of coarse comes the master comedian Jack.Its a pity this series didnt go for another 8 seasons.After season 8 gets released,thats it,all we can do is replay the whole series over and over,which is what i do. I suppose if Three's a Crowd gets released i might get it,only because of John Ritter.I do remember it being shown here in 1985,but it just didnt spark as well as Three's Company. I would like to thank Anchor Bay for this fantastic release of this series.The quality of the episodes is clear.They have done a brilliant job here 
 I read this book in my 30s or 40s, many years ago.  I am only thinking of it now because I will be giving it as a gift to a high school graduate.  While I don't remember the content, I do remember that, prior to reading this book, I had no particular interest in history; after reading it, I saw history in a whole new light 
 I purchased this book in serial form.  The first book was a pretty slow start.  The characters felt two dimensional and the storyline shallow.  Quite frankly, I almost didn't buy the second book in the series.  I'm glad I did.  After a disappointing beginning, the book picked up the pace in the second book and I found mself very interested how the story was going to develop and how Buffy and the Scoobies were going to save the day.  Had the first book in the series been a bit more excing, I would have given the story a full five star rating, but it finished well enough to deserve a four out of five 
   This book came out at about the same time as Carl Zimmer's "Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins." Zimmer's book is far more readable, but contains less detail.    Stringer and Andrews get into considerable detail about the history of human evolution as it is perceived by contemporary scientists. The book is divided into three broad sections: the search for our ancestors, the fossil evidence of their existence and how the evidence is interpreted.    The authors do an excellent job of providing an immense amount of information without bogging down the reader in scientific jargon. Advanced theories and methodologies are explained in terms that a layperson can grasp.    Overall an excellent introduction to the subject for the motivated reader. Most people, however, would probably find Zimmer's book more palatable.    The one thing I really didn't like about this book was the authors propagandizing for extremist global warming views. Reading their chapter on the subject, one would never imagine that there are thousands of respected scientists who don't agree with the alarmists. Of course, both Springer and Andrews, their institutions and colleagues stand to benefit from continued government funding of the "threat." Gee, no one would expect that scientists could be seduced by the prospect of easy money.  Jerr 
  Ehrman writes for the common man to understand the true origins of Christianity, which were distorted by Dan Brown in "Da Vinci Code." Ehrhman, a professor of religious studies, speaks of Constantine, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Mary Magdalene, symbols in Christianity, and Jesus as a human. It's all fascinating -- why Dan Brown felt the need to distort, I don't know, except perhaps for publicity, outraging Christians. I am not a Christian (I'm an atheist), but you need not be religious to find the roots of the religion interesting. At the end of this short tome, you will feel more educated 
 The Short Victorious War, the third installment in David Weber's outstanding Honor Harrington series, is a very enjoyable read.  Honor is an medical leave healing from injuries suffered in The Honor of the Queen when she thwarted the assassination attempt on Grayson Protector Benjamin Mayhew.  Hostilities between the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the People's Republic of Haven erupt into an actual shooting war.  The PRH is a cradle-to-the-grave welfare state whose economy has gone into the toilet, as the Republic struggles to continue to support the staggering number of Dolists among its population.  The Peeps' ususal remedy for this problem is to invade planets or solar sytems that are stronger economically, but weaker militarily.  But now they are left with only weak agricultural powers to contend with, or they could go after the extremely powerful Manticorans.  Honor is eager to return to space, and gets to do so, this time in command of the HMS Nike.  Her nemesis Captain Lord Pavel Young returns as well.  The Short Victorious War is a worthwhile read, and the Honor Harrington series is becoming addictive for me, as I can't wait to read Book Four (Field of Dishonor).    
 What can I say? I like this movie. I know it is manipulative and contrieved. You know how it's going to end, but it is a very entertaining movie! It does have it's virtues though. A very insiteful film that has a lot more going for it than just another college frathouse flick 
 This is the most beautiful western novel you'll ever read.  It is centered around the hero of the book, Shane.  He is the most beautiful, awesome man you'll ever know.  He leaves a delicate impact on the family he visits, and he will leave one on you, too.  I was touched.  The end could make you sad.  But it's still worth it 
 He had wanted to update Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" for modern times, Ian Rankin writes about his first Inspector Rebus novel, "Knots and Crosses" in the introduction to the British compilation "Rebus: The Early Years" (unfortunately, not available in the U.S.), which contains the first three installments of the series. Oblivious to the mere existence of such a thing as the mystery genre - or so Rankin says - he was stunned to soon hear his book described first and foremost as a crime novel. But eventually this characterization prompted him to have a closer look at the work of other mystery writers, and he found that the form suited his purposes just fine; that in fact he "could say everything [he] wanted to say about the world, and still give readers a pacy, gripping narrative."  Bearing in mind the original duality of Jekyll and Hyde, however, Rankin's tales are not dominated by a contrast painted in black and white. While the villains Inspector Rebus faces are certainly every bit as evil as Stevenson's Mr. Hyde, Rebus himself is far from a clean-slated "good guy:" Divorced, cynical, hard-drinking and a former member of the SAS, he is a brother in spirit to every noir detective from Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade and Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe to Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch, James Ellroy's squad of crooked cops and Peter Robinson's Alan Banks. Nor is Rebus's Edinburgh the touristy town of Calton Hill, castle and Summer Festival (although the series has meanwhile sparked real-life guided tours to its most famous locations, too) - as befitting a true detective of his ilk, Rankin's antihero moves primarily in the city's dark and dirty underbelly, which is populated by society's losers and where those who have "made it," those with money in their pockets, only show up if they have shady deals to conduct as well.  "Tooth and Nail" (originally titled "Wolfman," for the alias that police have given the subject of their hunt) takes Rebus to London, where - due an earlier case of his own reluctantly deemed an "expert" on serial murderers - he is to assist metro CID with the case of a killer named for the bite marks he leaves on his victims' bodies.  Not overly enthusiastic about any aspect of his mission to the capital (and thus mirroring once more the feelings of Rankin himself, who did not much like living there, either, and "brought Rebus to London so he could suffer, too"), Rebus soon alienates his metro counterpart by his constant unwillingness to follow protocol, although the two men get along reasonably well on a personal level. Eventually, Rebus so seriously jeopardizes his and - by extension - Edinburgh CID's reputation with the Met that he is about to be recalled home, when he finally makes the crucial connection that unmasks the killer, just in time to save the young psychologist who has offered her help with the case and who is his latest love interest. (As befits a good noir detective, Rebus has a new flame in every book, not without incurring fresh scars from each separation, however.)  While this series had a terrific start already in its first three novels, published between 1987 and 1992, Rebus's character - and Rankin's writing - has evolved significantly over time. Thus, it is probably wise to read it in the order of publication. Contrary to his nonseries novels, however, which he views much more critically in hindsight, Ian Rankin overall still seems to be happy with his early Rebus books, commenting almost nostalgically: "I can't read them without thinking back to my own early years, my apprenticeship as a crime writer. Read and enjoy." I have nothing to add to that .. 
 This was the first book in astrology I ever bought, amazing seeming it was over 20 years ago just after it was first published.  This book has an energy about it, as obviously from the previous reviews, Stephen Arroyo has IT, he is the consummate humanistic astrologer who can give people the absolute astrological stuff that we need when we need it.  Very much in the same area of astrology as Liz Green, yet in my opinion much more easily accessible, for as much as I adore Liz Greene's work, it can be quite intense and needs many readings to take in what she is saying.  All of Stephen Arroyo's books are a joy to read, this one being my favourite.  If you love astrology you need to do yourself a favour and buy this book 
 This book is very good.  It gives facts, as well as possible outcomes.  Overall, the book lets the world know, GMO is bad news 
 Sexy, steamy music. Passionately true to the film, and a delightful homage to jazz music.  Harlem Blues will put you in the middle of a jazz club on a warm summer night.  Should be called Mo BEST Blues.  Love it 
 A middling effort by Carl Hiaasen still rates as a better than average read, and Skin Tight will not rank even remotely near his better stuff like Skinny Dip and Striptease.  Maybe it's not fair to call this a middling effort though, since it was written in 1989.  Since then Hiaasen has just written a lot of very, very good books.  Dated though it may be this is still a lot of fun!  Mick Stranahan is a retired detective, semi-forced into retirement by a fatal encounter with a corrupt judge.  That alone might explain why someone is trying to kill him, but nothing is ever quite so simple as it seems.  How else to explain the lethal impact of a weed whacker?  And is it possible that the people behind the movie Fargo happened to read Skin Tight while writing that movie?  Inquiring minds want to know since the two otherwise disparate efforts share a black comedy style with a single semi-critical plot twist.  You'll get a further update of Stranahan's adventures in crime and love, in the more recent Skinny Dip.  But this makes for a great introduction.  As with all of Hiaasen's books that I've read, this is a perfect book to share.  Do you have a significant other that likes to read aloud from the newspaper?  Does your traveling companion think that the latest Alan Greenspan lecture is one that has to be shared in minute detail?  Trust me, you'll find plenty of return fire in Hiaasen's writing.  You'll be laughing aloud so often, and with such volume that they will be begging you to explain what's so funny.  And even if they don't, you'll want to read parts aloud just because you can! 
 The desperately poor women who become carriers of drugs--inside their stomachs, no less--risk a terrible death but are willing to do so for the chance to live in the U.S.  Not a propaganda piece, but a hard, cold look at the truth.  
 Jessica is a successful wedding planner based in London. She manages to pull off the perfect day for so many couples, they suddenly, on the morning of her own wedding, she gets cold feet and leaves the groom at the altar, setting out on the honeymoon they were meant to spend together. Upon returning from the honeymoon, she realizes her error and wants to get back with Nick. Nick, it seems, has moved on. She also tries to move on, but her heart still belongs to Nick.  Fiona, Nick's sister (and Jess' best friend), is ready to settle down with her new beau (a wedding photographer whom she met at the ill-fated nuptials). She is not sure she wants Jess to get back together with Nick, out of fear that he will be hurt again.  Jess' sister Sophie has what everyone thinks is the perfect marriage with Simon. They eloped in Tahiti, only to find out that their marriage is not valid.  Jess' hugely successful celebrity wedding between a movie star and a "commoner" (purported to be a fairy tale that starts out as a business arrangement for publicity) brings about a new friend in Emma. Though Jack and Emma are virtual strangers, they soon start to fall in love.  I like the modern take on marriage in the new millennium, and while I found it the be a great story, I think that there is far too much marital and relationship strife with such a huge cast of characters - this could easily have been four separate novels! As a result, there is not enough individual development, but I like how Sigaloff keeps up guessing until right up to the end with each of the relationships. 
 Used cloth for first 2 months with Tushies at night which worked out great. Started using Tushies exclusively after that. Like the diaper, gel free, soft and comfortable, but don't believe the size if your baby is chubby. We bought way too many small size that supposedly go to 14 lbs. Our girl was 12lb13oz at 2 months and hard to get a tight fit at the waist. Had a couple leaks. Now she is pooing only 2-3 times a day seems she has a blow out about once daily out the leg or back - reason only giving 4 stars. Hopefully the medium size will fit better 
 In many ways the fate of British PULP is rather tragic. They struggled for far more than a decade before they finally had their well-deserved breakthrough with 1995's 'Different Class'. After which they made the descision to turn artistic rather than mainstream - bad for record sales, good for the fans. As expected, as the music grew progressively better and more deep, the sales-number's dropped critically. This collection could be the opportunity for the band to show that they never lost the nerve, even if their later releases didn't spawn any great smash-hits like 'Common People' and 'Disco 2000' from before-mentioned breakthrough album.  The reason for this is that the album includes strictly only the songs picked for A-side releases - and while none of these songs are bad, I still think the person who was responsible for picking the songs for single-release from their latest album 'We Love Life' must have been hit - hard - in the head, with the result of critical loss of good sense, before making that selection. A pity, because I still believe that album could have done so much better than it did.  The songs on this compilation are arranged in chronoligical order, and covers the albums 'His'n'Hers', 'Different Class', 'This Is Hardcore' and 'We Love Life' - all released on the Island label. The bands earlier career is well documentet in several other compilation, most common is the somewhat uneven "Countdown" double-CD. In my oppinion, any affectionate of the bands later music should try to get a hand on their last pre-Island album 'Seperations', that is imo. fully as good as any as their Island records, in its own peculiar way - and considerably better than 'His'n'Hers'. However, let me give a brief run-through of the songs on this CD.   - His'n'Hers Era -  Four tracks are included from this album, and while none of them are bad, only one - 'Do You Remember The First Time?' - is on level with their later work. All songs share a thematic focus on relationships - or perhaps one should say, failed relationships - and they fully display Jarvis Cockers amazing ability to write clever lyrics. However, I think these songs are all very pesimistic - sarcasm is more dominating than irony here, spite more pronounced than humor - which is a shame, because much of the charm of the bands later work is missing on that account. Also, the melodies are not - with the exception of Do You Remember ... - completely succesfull imo; there is a rather forced, constructed sound to these songs, they are neither as catchy nor elegant as later compositions.  The problem is that when the songs are arrange chronologically, the album opens on a low, which is never a good thing. I'd be very tempted to simply skip the first 3 songs when putting this on, and get right to the REAL stuf.   - Different Class era -  While Do You Remember The First Time? gave the band some airplay and spawned interest, 'Common People' brought PULP to everybody's attention. The song became a well-deserved smash-hit all around the world, and for the good reasons. The lyrics are brilliant - clever and funny at the same time - and the melody is extremely catchy. The tempo-change of the song, that starts out slow and the incrases pace throughout it's more than 5 minutes, is a brilliant detail.  The record spawned a long series of hits - 'Sorted For E's And Wizz' (released as a double-A-side with Mis-Shapes, which is for some reson excluded here?), 'Disco 2000' and 'Something Changed'. Also released on single was the track 'Underwear', only included on the UK version of this compilation. If the greatest weaknes of the Different Class album was that nearly all the songs were quite close in sound, that was easily forgiven considering the consistent high quality of the songs.   - This Is Hardcore era -  Following the sudden mega succes of Different Class, PULP took some time off trying to get to terms with their newfound fame, with all it's good and, especially, bad sides. They came back with the dark and moody 'This Is Hardcore'. That the band had taken a more serious turn was obvious from first single 'Help The Aged', focusing on the lonelines of old people in modern society. The track also has a much heavier rock-sound than their previous releases, which might have scared away some of the bands former fans, that liked the easy-going sound of their former hits.  That sound was characteristic for the whole album, which was much darker than earlier work. Fans were divided - some prefered the old style, while other found that the "new" PULP was much more serious and interesting than the "old", and also the music grew increasingly more refined. The title track, second single of the album, has an eery atmosphere of gloom, and with lyrics about sexual fantasies about starring in porn movies - never explicit, but quite obvious - it is very far from main-stream. 'A Little Soul' sounds like a quite normal, sweet pop-tune - that is, until you listen to the lyrics, about a man telling his song about how he left the family and the boys mother and spent the nights with other women. Quite a task to pull such a song off to a merry pop-tune, but PULP manage this with splendor. Not many other bands, if any, could have done it. Last single from the album was 'Party Hard' - one of the most rocking uptempo songs the band have done.   - We Love Life era -  The band's latest album was promoted with the double A-side single 'The Trees'/'Sunrise'. Sunrise is a glorious pop-song about coming out of a personal crisis and facing up to life again. The song has an absolutely glorious instrumental/choral second part that takes your breath away. Easily one of the most beautiful songs writting within the last 10 years. On the other side, The Trees was an eery song with an odd violin song and a theme about lost love. This track is not bad, but deffinitely not very radio-friendly, and the single failed to create a lot of airplay. Thus, the new album went virtually un-noticed on release.  As second single was picked the song 'Bad Cover Version' - again, not a bad song, but still one of the weakest from the album in my oppinion. The song is quite slow and not as elegant or catchy as much more obvious picks from the album like 'The Night That Minney Timperley Died', 'The Birds In You Garden' og 'Bob Lind (The Only Way Is Down)'. As such, this single also failed to increase record sales, and after this no further singles were released from the album - a great pity.   - New track -  The compilation includes one new song, 'The Last Day Of The Mines' Strike'. Again, this is not a bad song, but it doesn't really offer me a lot. It's very slow, it's not a radio friendly song, and though I suppose the lyrics aren't bad, the song never really cought onto me. A bit ironic actually, this album starts on a low, and ends on a low, which is never a good thing.   - Songs Not Included -  There are many songs from their albums that are not on this compilation, but that I think are much better than those included here. 'Mis-Shapes' was released as a single, but didn't make it unto here for some mysterious reason? 'I Spy' wasn't very radio-friendly, but was by far the most clover song off Different Class. 'Live Bed Show' could easily have made the cut as a single release. 'F.E.A.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E' was also a very interesting track, hinting at the more dark sound of the next record.  'The Fear', opener from This Is Hardcore, was always a favorite of mine. Likewise, 'TV Movie' is a delightful track, and 'Sylvia' and 'Glory Days' both displayed ample of hit material. 'Wickerman' from We Love Life is beyond doubt the bands most complicated song to date - and also probably their best. Other highlights off that record were 'The Weets', 'The Night That Minnie Timperley Died', 'Birds In Your Garden' and 'Bob Lind'.  Thus, I think they should have followed the example of the first compilation release 'Countdown', and made this a double CD. THe second CD could have run something like:  Mis-Shapes - I Spy - Live Bed Show - F.E.A.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E - Underwear - The Fear - TV Movie - Sylvia - Glory Days - The Weets - The Night That Minnie Timperley Died - Wickerman - The Birds In Your Garden - Bob Lind (The Only Way Is Down) - Grandfather's Nursery  That would have made an much more compete and satisfactory collection. As the CD is now, it's a great CD with 10 masterful songs and a handful of good ones to follow, but it could have been even better.  Overall rating: 9 / 1 
 I guess I didn't quite understand it was a t-shirt - I thought it was another book!  Yes, I'm a teacher and a HUGE Junie B. Jones fan!  The shirt looks like it's of good quality, but I can't wear it (sob!) as I'm an "adult large".  What do I do with it?  I teach Sp. Ed., so if I make a pillow out of it, my (school) kids will surely destroy it!  :^(           
 I got this book for my birthday one year after finding it on the shelf at a bookstore. Being a part of the minority group of gay Christians, I was intrigued. The "target audience" for the book is for homosexuals and their loved ones, but it really could be read by anyone, and I think it should be. McNeill offers theology on living in fear, guilt, shame, anger, and living with pathological faith and the importance of maturing spiritually. I think any Christian can relate to any (if not all) of these topics, and not just struggling gay Christians. It's the kind of book that you may want to read with a pencil or pen in your hand so you can underline parts that are important to you. (That's what I did.) This is a caring, humble, and comforting book, and one that I highly recommend and cherish 
 I really enjoyed "Destiny's Song" which was my first Kim Louise book and look forward to reading more from this author.  Destiny Chandler was a photo historian in search of peace, quiet and freedom.  After having the satisfaction of seeing her abusive ex boyfriend sentenced to jail, she takes a trip to Atlanta to unwind, regroup and find herself.  When her best friend Jacq gives her a CD by a popular singer to unwind by, Destiny's recuperation was well underway.  However, when she glances at the singer on the CD cover, she starts to salivate and begins fantasizing about him.   Xavier Allgood, is truly ALL GOOD.  However, because of his star status, the dred-wearing, mouth-watering, sexy R&B singer has the unfounded reputation of being a player -- quite the contrary.  Xavier has been played and therefore, steers clear of serious relationships.  So when he sees Destiny at a mutual friend's house, all his convictions of not becoming involved with anyone fly right out the window and he falls hard.  The book was a little slow in the beginning. At times, I found myself skipping pages to get some idea of what would happen next.  However, the pace began to pick up midway and that's when I truly discovered the talent of Ms. Louise.  She weaved a wonderful story of two people struggling to love and trust again. The love scenes were sexy and touching. The book clearly demonstrates what can happen if and when emotional baggage can't be unloaded.  I've become a fan; it was a very good read.

 Untill now, I, along with most of the people I know, thought that  WWII only affected the Jewish population, it affected the Germans as well. For me, the beginning of the book was a bit slow-going, but once i got into it a little farther,I found out that it was a great book with a wonterful moral. These two little girls, one a Jew, one Nazi-German, managed to retain a beautiful friendship despite hundreds of miles and social bounderies between them. I would reccomend it to anyone, especially kids 
 The author is both historian and ex-military man (went to Sandhurst). He understands the Russian campaign of Nazi Germany, both the grand strategic moves and the quick tactical decisions made under fire. I consider this book magisterial. It is broad in scope, covering conferences involving Hitler and his generals, Stalin and his NKVD brass (Beria, Molotov, Kruschev), but also quoting from letters written home by the soldiers on the front, many never delivered, and civilian accounts. He interviewed survivors of the five-month long battle fifty years later, read documents in official archives, army daily battle diaries, and much more. The research is impeccable. Best of all, he writes clearly and lays out the events from the points of view of both sides in turn. The story he tells is one of human madness, egotism, stupidity, arrogance, uncaring, greed, animalism, and very occasionally, altruism, heroism, loyalty, and instinct for sacrifice. Stalingrad was the end point of the German invasion of Russia; after losing that struggle in January 1943, the Wermacht was in constant retreat. The reader is not spared descriptions of the horrors of war: death, destruction, famine, pestilence, wounds that would not heal, depression that would not lift, hope for relief that would not result in relief. As a boy of nine, I remember the newsreels showing the endless columns of ragged prisoners being marched across the snow-covered steppe, and the ruins of the city, reduced to partial walls, cellars and huge piles of rubble. It was in these scenes that fighting was carried on house to house, room to room, hole to hole. I think the greatest lesson to be learned from this sad story is that most men care more about themselves than their fellows, that usually, they will give only if they can get something in return, and that there is a basic stubbornness in some of them that will cause them to ignore obvious impending disaster to follow some mythic victory inside their heads 
 A very good book fitted to all levels of readers, from beginners to initiates.  Very easy to read and you will go deeper and deeper in the understanding and knowledge of tarots without even noticing it.  ChC 
 What Sticks is supposedly the definitive book on making advertising work. I did not come away with that impression. Briggs and Stuart are smart men and I am not questioning their knowledge; however after thoroughly studying advertising the past two semesters I did not see two many new items. The item that I will remember forever will be COP or Communication Optimization Process. This relates to the message, media mix, motivation, and maximization of the advertising campaign.   The different categories could each be argued to be the most important, yet without each one no marketing campaign will succeed. That is the thesis of the book. The authors continue on in each chapter going a little further in detail on the subject. The book is split into three parts: Marketing is Broken, The Advertising Fix, and Guaranteeing your advertising works. The authors do a good job showing their sources in the back of the book. Most of their information comes from their personal study and work with companies. This does not take away from their credibility. I would love to have the experience the authors have with marketing; however I do feel this is better than Innovation Killer because it touches more areas. Briggs and Stuart touch on innovation and how that helps a company; they discuss way more issues than that.  A new rule that came from the authors is the 70/20/10 rule. The 70 percent go toward proven marketing strategies. The 20 percent should go to innovative marketing strategies or in simpler terms strategies that have worked but are changed just enough to say they are new. The last 10 percent should be spent on new strategies that have no proven record. This will keep the department on their heels and always looking for new ways to improve sales. The tips in the book are simple and can be implemented either right away or in a short time period. This book like Innovation Killer will encourage change in the workplace which will lead to innovative thinking.  Nothing too new but should be read for the small tips that are illustrated throughout the book. There are also ads that they compare and show the one that worked. The small things in the book like repeating brand name to improve sales will come across as elementary; however, the truth is if it was so elementary then companies would not waste billions of dollars on ad campaigns that do not lead to sales.  10/3/2006 Dustin Roberts

 I don't know that I can write this review without injecting it with ample amount of gushing praise, but I will try.  I teach media and communications at the college level and have been studying pop culture and its effect on society for over 20 years.  That said, this book was only on the periphery of my attention for some time.  It took me seeing it was used as a text for a course a fellow instructor at Penn State to buy it and read it.  To say "I couldn't put it down" is cliche, but I honestly could NOT resist reading this book.  I often read several books at a time, but this book demanded my constant attention.  While it covers the same ground as many histories of comic books do (in particular Men of Tomorrow), and while many comic fans who have studied their favorite medium's past will already be familiar with many of the points Wright brings up in Comic Book Nation, this book is never less than entertaining and enlightening.  What makes it a bit different from other histories is not so much that Wright is a comic lover, but that he lets that love shine through.  He makes no aplogies when comics made him (and probably many of his reader) cringe and also praises creators, creations, and comics where praise is needed.  He also offers the most balanced account of the oft-discussed Seduction of the Innocent era of comic books I have read to date.  This book is a joy.  
 This second book in the series shows that Everson and Chadwick have the potential to develop into top writers in the thriller genre. They also create characters that live in the real world-often the gritty side of the real world. If you're looking for a book of twists and turns and you're never sure where the story is going next, this is the book for you 
 I bought the book because I needed to know more about beauty care from head to toe.  The book is very informative.  I wish it could be more in depth where black hair is concerned.  I have relaxed long hair that tends to get frizzy very easily and can be hard to style.  I really needed to know more about that.  Overall, this book is worth the price 
 I reluctantly gave this superb film 5 stars not because of any shortcomings in the script or the acting-both are unbelievebly good-but because of what the studio had done to the movie.   It was originally released at over 3 hours in lenght. When exhibitors demanded that it be shortened Warner's obliged by cutting it to 154 minutes. In the early 1980s the studio realized what it really had, and set about reconstructing and restoring the movie.  Because of initial sloppiness (footage being thrown out), it became impossible to fully reconstruct the film. The result is that there is a segment of some 7 minutes of stills about one hour into the picture trying to restore some of the lost scenes. Gone, too, apparently. is Vicki Lester's screen test.  All of this aside, what the viewer sees on the 1999 digitally restored DVD is superb. The color correction of the nearly 20 minutes it was possible to restore is excellent. The actors' performances are outstanding. Not only is Garland a superb singer and dancer,but the close intimate scenes with Mason radiate a warmth and tenderness rarely captured on film. Mason, too, is superb as Norman Maine. When drunk, his character is absolutely dispicable-becoming phisical and violent. Great, too, is the supporting cast.Jack Carson as the studio publicist Libby plays the role with much more profesionalialism and less corniness than his counterpart Lionel Streater did in 1937.  This is, by far, the best version of the film and well worth owning and viewing- dispite the minor shortcomings of its reconstruction.There is not one corny word of dialog in the Moss Hart script 
  That the stories of the Old Testament are based on older myths is not new.  That the stories, parables, and mysticisms of the New Testaments borrow heavily from the Old Testament and from myth is also well-established.  Doherty's premise, however, is a minority viewpoint - that Jesus, himself, was a totally fictional character.    Books of Biblical textual criticism concentrate on irreconcilable contradictions, political motivations of the author(s), stories presented as historical shown not to be, archeological findings at variance with the Bible, anachronisms, and theological impossibilities.  Doherty does that, too, but then produces a different interpretation of the evidence showing that Jesus was just as much a myth as Zeus.  For Example:  Pagan mythology and common belief in those days understood the heavens to consist of seven layers - the greatest gods being at the highest level.  Status in otherworldly life diminished with the hierarchy of the level occupied, until the level immediately above earth was occupied by demons and evil spirits.  The "Son of Man" was thought to have sacrificed himself by descending downward through the levels - never reaching earth - until he was killed and gave a blood sacrifice for the redemption of mankind.  Subsequently, he was resurrected and ascended back into heaven.  If the letters of Paul are read in the context of these beliefs, a whole different concept of his theology emerges.  He wasn't talking about a historical Jesus.  Was I convinced?  Well, maybe not, but I will never again read an excerpt of Biblical textual criticism without considering Doherty's spin.  Only the finding of ancient corroboratory writings would prove his theory feasible.  If it IS true, the pseudonymous author who wrote Mark - who undoubtedly knew he was creating fiction - unknowingly and innocently pulled off the biggest hoax in history - accidentally becoming more influential than any other man who ever existed.     
 Liz Pryor, the author, has definitely done her research.  Granted it is not highly technical research where she has conversed with hundreds of psychologists and then spouts a bunch of psychobabble about how women treat women friends in a certain way because of their upbringing.  No, it is much more about how women don't even realize they are passive agressive.  How no matter how upfront we are with our male partners or friends, we are less than upfront with our girl friends when it comes to letting go.  If you have ever experienced "a snubbing" by a friend, this will definitely help you see that it may not have been about you.  Maybe this will help us all end those girl relationships that have grown tired a little more gracefully.  And if it doesn't, it is still a good book 
 Excellent read for parents of college bound children. Illuminates which attributes may differentiate a student from the crowd. Jay Murray Solutions for Tuitio 
 Sub-Title: From the Peculiar to Practical, Advice From a 19th Century Explorer ==There are a lot of books on how to go camping, what to take on a hiking trip, and so on. But where would you be able to find that 'Camels are only fit for use in a few countries, and require practiced attendants; thorns and rocks lame them, hills sadly impede them, and a wet slippery soil entirely stops them.'   This book was written about 150 years ago when a hike often meant something like spending a year or two out in the bush, hiking around Africa.   The idea for this book came to Sir Francis Galton when he was exploring South-western Africa (now Namibia) in 1850-51. Upon his return to England he began reading and interviewing other travellers who had been to different exotic locals. And from this combined with practical experience and testing.   It makes for a delightful read and forever thankful that we live in a more advanced time 
 This is another good resource for children to use hands on to learn word families at any grade.  My students really love these books and like to take them home to read to their parents 
 In 1955, Miles decided to leave Prestige for the larger and better known Columbia recording company, but he still owed Prestige 4 albums in order to fulfill his contract terms. So on May 11, 1956, and again on Oct. 26, 1956, he and his quintet, which included John Coltrane, went into the Van Gelder studios and layed down a long string of titles which went into the 4 albums; these albums were COOKIN', RELAXIN', WORKIN', and STEAMIN'. Sides from both sessions were intermixed on each album.   All the sides here are from the Oct. 26 date (in fact, they were the last titles recorded). All the tunes swing pretty hard, except the ballad feature for Miles (Trane sits out), MY FUNNY VALENTINE. BLUES BY FIVE is a good medium-up blues, and Sonny Rollin's AIREGIN is taken at a gallop. By this time the quintet was meshing pretty well, and all the music recorded on these dates is excellent. 
 I love Twinings, but 300 packets of it are a bit too much to purchase at one time. There needs to be an option for smaller packaging with this product. 
 It made me a little bit nervous, as the delivery took longer than it usually does and after receiving the confirmation of shipment I received a mail saying there was a problem with such.  Anyway, the package arrived in good condition and in the time limits 
 I must have 15 Photoshop CS/CS2 books on my shelf and although I've learned something from each of them, there is one thing that is missing. That is, readability. Complete Photoshop CS2 for D.P. is the first book that I WANT TO READ!! I like reading this book!! Each chapter is clear, concise, and full of tips. It is presented in such a way that you learn twice as much, in half the time! If only I could start over I'd buy this one book. Not only would I save space on my bookshelf, but I  would have enough money for CS3 
 Under $11 is a good price for the Epson ink catridges and they work for the R800 or R1800, which I have, a great printer. The description doesn't say for the R1800, but it is, says it right on the packaging. I've paid $13-$15 elsewhere when needed at last minute.  I seem to use more yellow cartridges than any of the others 
 This is the most comprehensive volume on American criminal history to date and, considering its scope, the most accurate. If you're looking for both accuracy and intelligence in this genre, forget the histrionic silliness of Bloodletters and Badmen and head straight for The Encyclopedia of American Crime. Also highly recommended for organized crime buffs is Sifakis' other classic, The Mafia Encyclopedia 
 My son loves his Elmo.  I got this for him because he loves Elmo, and I also wanted to get him a "baby doll" that wasn't girly.  We ask him "Where's Baby?" and he knows Elmo as baby. The best price was here on Amazon, especially with free super saving shipping.  TRU had it for about fifteen dollars. This doll is nothing spectacular, very few bells and whistles, but it's a great little addition to your kid's Elmo collection and hopefully will become the baby of the house like it has ours.  My son is 2 
 This book is top rate.  It was recommended from another author's website, and so I raced out and bought a copy.  I can see why the high praise.  Leadership is SO OVERUSED, and this book brings it into very real, applicable, humorous focus.  Love-Energy-Audacity-Proof are going to be the calling cards of my projects.  Farber brings warmth and sincerity to his characters and provides deep thoughts to the reader.  This book will haunt you for hours (and probably days and weeks) after you put it down 
 This is an excellent soundtrack! If you loved the show la femme nikita you will love the soundtrack. It it jammed pack full of techno songs pulled directly from your favorite episodes!! 
 SPOILERS throughout.   No, RAW DEAL isn't one of the Governator's best flicks, not by a long shot. But it's not his worst either (ever cringe thru JINGLE ALL THE WAY, JUNIOR, or COLLATERAL DAMAGE?). Having been released on the heels of the high octane, vastly entertaining COMMANDO, RAW DEAL suffers from the inevitable comparison. This film does have quite a bit to offer Schwarzenegger fans, but, let's be real, it's not as good as COMMANDO. But is RAW DEAL worth watching? Definitely. Is it worth purchasing? I believe so. I bought it. But, then again, I'm an old fan of our muscled Austrian. Shucks, I even voted for him.    As early as 1986 - when RAW DEAL came out - at the beginnings of his Hollywood career as he was still developing what would become his trademark cinematic identity, Schwarzenegger was even then charismatic enough to turn many an action fan's head. That he had a certain flair for droll one-liners was an unlooked-for bonus. In fact, I believe that his wry sense of humor and the implied intelligence that went with that was the decider in making him the overwhelming box office action king over the likes of Stallone, Seagal, and Norris. And Arnold was savvy enought to capitalize on his advantage. He had a firm grasp of his talents and rarely stepped outside his purview. In his role of Sheriff Mark Kaminsky, Arnold is well within his limited acting range. RAW DEAL makes no pretense about what it is: a slam-bang action movie that directly traverses from Point A to Point B and is jam-packed with auto carnage, blazing bullets and thudding fists, all the while showcasing Mr. "I'll Be Back" (a catchphrase which I don't think he says in this film).      The plot: Mark Kaminsky (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is an ex-FBI agent now exiled into sheriffing in a small, nowhere town and saddled with an embittered wife. A promise of possible reinstatement from an old FBI colleague with a personal agenda convinces Kaminsky to infiltrate the Chicago crime syndicate and try to tear it apart from within; if possible, he's given the added task of unearthing the mole who's been selling out the FBI. Kaminsky stages his own death, slicks back his hair, and dons his double-breasted threads. In his attempt to get noticed by the mob, he makes a splashy showing at a mob gambling joint and, from there, rapidly works his way up the criminal hierarchy, occasionally tearing off chunks of mafia flesh.   Is there much violence in RAW DEAL? You bet your arse, there is. Nowadays, when our film action stars all seem to practice fancy martial arts, popping in an Arnold flick in a dvd player is a bit like time travelling to the primitive, old school ways of villain smiting. Arnold never was that limber nor did he ever somersault in the air and execute a graceful roundhouse kick to the head. His style is akin to a relentless runaway train as he uses his monumental strength and power to subdue his opponents via wrestling holds and throws and that gool ol' American standby: the punch to the face. And if he can't hit you or kick you, for sure he doesn't have any compunctions about shooting you up full of lead. And then, of course, he'll submit the coup de gras: a witty punchline at your expense. In RAW DEAL, he uses his "techniques" to traumatize villains in mall clothing stores, gambling casinos, gravel pits, and mafia headquarters, the last venue being where he really launches into Terminator mode. You see, in his own fashion, Arnold does have a certain implacable panache.  The acting? It's decent. Schwarzenegger is Schwarzenegger which means that Schwarzenegger isn't Anthony Hopkins. In terms of acting, Schwarzenegger isn't even Thelma Hopkins. But, here, he's ably upheld by his supporting cast, the most recognizable of whom are Darren McGavin, MURPHY BROWN's Joe Regalbuto, and the ever untrustworthy Robert Davi. Kathryn Harrold is so-so as the love interest (and, mind you, she's not the wife), actually shining for a moment in a restaurant scene with Arnold as she takes him to task for his lack of amorousness. And, yes, this movie drops one of my favorite Arnold wisecracks: As his unhappy, intoxicated wife heaves a cake at him, his character retorts: "You should not drink and bake." Classic. Another line overheard in passing which cracked me up: as Kaminsky and Davi's character were pursuing a man thru a crowded bar, an offended, bumped-into bystander comments with a "Hey, you cretin!" C'mon, who says that, really?  
 I was in London on vacation and happened to see a write-up on this book in one of the tabloids! It sounded so great that as soon as I got back to the States, I picked up a copy. Simon is a fabulous writer and this is a truly important book 
 	Nanuk, el esquimal no solo fue el primer film de Robert Flaherty sino que fue también el film documental que, junto a El hombre de la cámara de Dziga Vertov, se distinguió del resto de las producciones documentales de la época al abrir un nuevo camino en el entendimiento de lo real mediante las imágenes cinematográficas. Y es que para Flaherty crear una imagen no era asunto de registrar lo que aparecía ante el lente de la cámara; las imágenes tenían que ser descubiertas para ser inventadas y así convertirse en metáforas. De ahí su sorprendente y polémico método de trabajo: años y años de rodaje y revelado, de observación y envolvimiento, de manipulación muchas veces inescrupulosa. Nanuk, el esquimal surgió luego de varias expediciones a la Bahía Hudson en Canadá, realizadas por Flaherty y su esposa y colaboradora Frances Flaherty, bajo la nómina de Sir William Mackenzie con el fin de averiguar el potencial ferroviario y mineral de toda esa vasta región. Conmovido por la experiencia humana de las gentes que habitaban esos parajes, en una de esas expediciones llevó consigo una cámara de fotografía y una de cine. Una vez allí, inventó en el transcurso de varios años la historia de Nanuk, un cazador de la etnia Inuit, y su lucha por la supervivencia en un ambiente hostil. El film fue proyectado con mucha concurrencia en el año 1922 y desde entonces ha sido una de las piedras más sólidas de la corta historia del cine. Con este film Flaherty dio un giro totalmente inédito, incluso hoy día, del quehacer cinematográfico y mostró lo que exige e implica la construcción, mediante imágenes, de un modo particular de observar lo real: un compromiso con lo que se observa que nos hace cómplices de lo que aparece ante los ojos; si bien Robert Flaherty no siempre le hizo justicia a lo real, sí, al menos, nunca le hizo injusticia.  
 I was a huge fan of Joy Division and Public Image Limited in that time, and still love them. That said. I am a New Order fan. I was of the few in San Francisco that saw them at the I-Beam on the first sans Ian tour. They were touching. That said. Strip them of their history and take this album as it is for the time it was released and even today, and still it holds as a very good set of songs about stretching across a blackened musical landscape of minor chords and sketchy guitar with guilt ridden vocals and the occasional dance-trippy melodies. Movement is a musical statement. It shows the now and the where to go of the later masterpiece, Power, Corruption And Lies. Movement is a gloomy record, but that's ok, the dark wave really did rejoice in it's melancholy and of course in it's layered sounds. Put this album next to PIL Metal BOX and Echo and the Bunneymens Heaven Up Here and you have a couple of dreamy hours into the netherlands of what was to become of Manchester and American Brit rock idolators. Great stuff, and a wonderful clarion call to what was to become the makings of the greatest dance single of all time from the darkness of Dreams Never End:  Blue Monday. After the regrettabel suicide of  Ian Curtis, who I hope has found some new incarntion better fitted to his damaged soul, New Order lifted spirits rathers than dampened them. 
 Varese Records presents two versions of "The Manchurian Candidate", both are excellent films with a great cast, directors and score that will leave you with something to think about.  The first "Manchurian Candidate" (1962/126 mins), Director John Frankenheimer featuring Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury, James Gregory, John McGiver and Leslie Parrish in a cult favorite of Cold War Intelligence mixed with a political assassination attempt ~ Harvey's portrayal as a brainwashed soldier is believably effective, his stepfather James Gregory (Senator Iselin) as the not to bright politician is a scene stealer ~ Harvey's domineering Mother played by Angela Lansbury is an Academy Award performance, when she's on screen her evil schemes cut right through you ~ with composer David Amram throwing cues at you "QUEEN OF DIAMONDS", "SLIGHTLY MANCHURIAN BLUES" and "MESOPOTAMAN MAMBO...but my pick from this score is "THEME FROM THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, the jazz version is a sure-fire winner with over five minutes of great JAZZ!  Second score from "Manchurian Candidate" (2004/130 mins), Director Jonathan Demme featuring Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, Liev Schrieber, Jon Voight and Kimberly Elise with an update of a classic thriller ~ Washington's facial and shifting eyes lends an intense factor to this remake, and it works ~ the score by Rachel Portman and Wyclef Jean with cues like "FORTUNATE SON" [instrumental], "MIND DRUGS", "DEEP IMPLANT BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION", "WHAT IF ALL THIS IS A DREAM?", "THERE ARE ALWAYS CASULATIES IN WAR" loaded with psychological-political themes and biting assassination spell-binding plots keeps you on the edge of your chair...presidential election mixed with mental illiness that Portman's score covers, as she crosses every "T" and dots all of the "I'z"...don't miss picking up this soundtrack...a must have for all "film-score-buffs" and collectors alike!  Total Time: 61:08 on 17 Tracks ~ Varese Records 66603 ~ (9/14/2004) 
 I almost puchased a 501 verbs conjugation book, but checked it out from the library first. I'm glad I did. It was way too bulky for a book that had so few verbs in it. The bershelle verb book is slim and has a very long list of verbs, their definitions, and exactly what page you can find the conjugations on. The other book left you guessing. I plan on using this book thoughout my french education. Il est tres utile pour appendre le francais 
 I'm not a kid, first of all. I am the mother of a 9-year old girl who happened to find this book at the library because she was intrigued by the cover art. So we checked it out, and sure enough, it was me who read it. I thought this book was fabulous; I couldn't put it down. So amazing how the author was able to capture the mind of Maud, in all it's imperfections, but still lovable. I was even hoping this book might be one in a series about this particular character by the author. Maybe like Maud is always on a series of quests? Anyway, I really loved the character and heartily recommend this book to all ages 
 The collaborative effort of country music experts Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, and now in an expanded and updated second edition, All Music Guide To Country: The Definitive Guide To Country Music is a gigantic, 963-page reference book which is crammed from cover to cover with reviews and ratings to 10,281 recordings by 1,219 artists and represent all facets and subgenres of the western music genre and is a compendium of facts and factoids about country music and the people who sing it. A thorough, "must-have" resource for dedicated country fans or anyone else who needs to look up country-music related information quickly, the text published in a rather tiny font -- so readers with impaired eyesight had best invest in a good magnifying glass 
 My daughter loves to draw but gets frustrated when her attempts are not recongizable to others.  This book breaks down each animal into simple shapes a child can copy.  It is easy to follow and my daughter has been pleased with her results.  I have seen an improvement in her drawing ability and confidence to try more difficult things 
 Anyone with moderate intelligence and sufficient leisure can work out their own private philosophy.  The worth of such a philosophy should not be measured by comparison to the great philosophers of the past (or present); rather we should ask how well does it assist its creator in coping with life.  Some personal philosophies are crafted in such a way that they help, not just their creator, but large numbers of their creator's fellow beings.  Thus it is with the personal philosophy of Robert M. Pirsig, who laments that he has not had an original thought in years.  "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" recounts a semi-mythical motorcycle trip from Chicago to California in which Pirsig confronts and defeats his inner demons and repairs his shattered relationship with his eldest son, Chris.  With a past of involuntary hospitalization, a present of recurring nightmares, and a future of anticipated return to commitment, Pirsig rides the roads, introspects, and works on his relationship with his son.  Pirsig's former self, whom he calls Phaedrus, went mad attempting to work out the meaning of the abstract concept of quality; his current self totters on the brink of madness attempting to achieve a quality relationship with his son.    The book covers thousands of miles of countryside and thousands of years of Western philosophy, from Chicago to California, from the Academy to academia.  Although the word Zen figures prominently in the title, and although Buddha is mentioned more than Socrates, the philosophy partakes far more of the tradition of the "Iliad" than of the "Bhagavad-gita."   Pirsig should not despair over his inability to formulate original ideas.  Qoheleth wrote that "there is nothing new under the sun," and centuries later Omar Khayyam echoed that thought.  Pirsig's chosen field of rhetoric recognizes man's basic lack of originality.  The first of the five departments of rhetoric is Invention, the devising of arguments.  An alternative name for that department is Discovery.  The rationale for this alternate name is that the rhetorician does not "invent" arguments, all the arguments already been invented.  The rhetorician simply discovers the best arguments for the case at hand.  The rhetorician's originality is expressed, not in the department of Invention/Discovery, but in the department of Arrangement.  How well are the arguments organized?  Pirsig may not have expressed any original ideas in "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", but he has arranged those ideas in (for the 1970's) a fresh, original way.  The enduring success of the book attests to Pirsig's creative genius.  
 This paper is great! Colors were more vibrant and seem to "pop" a little more than other papers. This is a good paper for a more artistic look to your photos 
 Kanye West is a genius, he is killin' 'em. Can't nobody touch Kanye right now, for real. This is a masterpiece, if you thought The College Dropout was good, please pick up this album, you will not be sorry. The production is better, his flow, his writing abilities, he just really stepped his game up. AMAZING. One of the best Hip Hop albums ever. Don't be stupid, buy this album if you aint got it. Diamonds are FOREVER 
 At one point, the Philadelphia Orchestra switched recording labels from Columbia to RCA. Since the Columbia Christmas recording was so popular, RCA decided to have the orchestra record a new LP that is now a compact disk. The style of this recording is very different from the Columbia recording. The arrangements are new and the chorus plays a central role. The album contains popular pieces such as Sleigh Ride and classical pieces such as The Waltz of the Flowers from The Nutcracker and the Pastoral Symphony from Messiah. The quality of the RCA recording, like the Columbia is excellent, and fans of the Philadelphia Orchestra and its conductor, Eugene Ormandy will not be disappointed 
 I gave this book to my wife who stays at home, and it is a great resource and read.  Chock full of information and as stay-at-home Mom's know, a much needed uplift in dealing with the daily needs of supporting the family.   Highly recommended 
 A young girl namedErin Law and two of her friends lives in a orphanage because they had no parents to takecare of them. Maureen is the woman who runs the orphanage. Sometimes there is nothing for them to do but run away, which is what they do and on their journey they meet the strangest thing that you might ever see. All the proof is in a little girl named Heaven Eyes.  
 No good deed goes unpunished as Comissario Guido Brunetti learns as this plot unravels.  Appearances can be deceiving but Brunetti is not fooled by first impressions and is able to put together the pieces of this puzzle aided by his secretary Signorina Elettra and trusted fellow officers 
 In addition to his famous children's novels, E.B. White was also a prolific essayist, letter writer and journalist for The New Yorker magazine. I first stumbled upon his book of letters about four years ago and was completely enthralled. Shortly thereafter I discovered his essays and was equally delighted. Mr. White was an exceptional writer and humorist. He could take the most trivial and mundane of topics and make them come alive; nothing escaped his observation. These essays are simply wonderful! .   The first section contains essays based on Mr.White's experiences living in the Maine countryside. "Death of a Pig" is far and away the best essay in this entire collection and my personal favorite. I love to read it aloud! Mr. White bought a spring pig, which he intended to fatten up and later slaughter during the wintertime. But instead the pig became ill and Mr. White found himself drawn into the role of the pig's friend and physician. If you think you could not possibly feel any strong emotion over a pig's demise, read this essay and you may find you feel very differently. It is one of the finest pieces of writing I have ever read; an exquisite commentary on mortality, both animal and human   "The Geese" were two of Mr. White's close companions, a goose and a gander. In this essay Mr. White describes the gander's death from old age and his subsequent attempts to supply the lonely widower with a new family. Immensely charming!   In "What Do Our Hearts Treasure?" it is Christmas 1965 and due to health problems the Whites are spending the winter not in their beloved Maine but in sunny, warm Florida. They are having a great deal of trouble adjusting to the difference in climate and surroundings and are feeling quite miserableand homesick. Three days before Christmas a large package arrives for them from their daughter-in-law in Maine which contains a delightful surprise that goes a long way in easing the Whites's homesickness. A truly lovely essay!   In "Once More to the Lake" Mr. White describes a trip he took with his son to visit the lake in Maine where he and his family vacationed every August when he was growing up. It is a nostalgic piece about the passage of time and growing older. Very, very nice!   These are only a small sampling of the many pieces contained in this volume. If you enjoy these essays, then I also highly recommend "The Letters of E.B. White" as well. This book spans six decades and contains letters written to friends, family members, colleagues, readers, anyone and everyone. Many of these letters are delightfully funny, especially the ones which feature Mr. White's troublesome red dachshund, Fred, to whom he often ascribed human characteristics and foibles in a very humorous manner.  --B. Eden 
 I loved this book as a child, my sister and I would go around saying the tongue twister name over and over!  We would try and out do each other by who could say it the fastest.  Now she is adopting a beautiful daughter from China and I thought this is the perfect book for my new neice.  She will be able to enjoy this fun story of two brothers who not only play well together but help each other when one is in trouble, like falling into a well.  It teaches children that even if they are not the first born they are just as special.    
 I am a confirmed Neal Asher book junkie, an easy enough fate to fall into since his novels are more addictive than crack cocaine. Every single one of them is a brilliant, enjoyable, thought-provoking and flat out fun science fiction romp which will leave you trembling like a junkie with delirium tremens waiting for the next installment. I crave his novels so much I can't wait for them to be released in the US, I go ahead pay the outrageous cost to purchase them from Amazon.co.uk (and count every penny as money well spent.) Since Mr. Asher is British his books are released there about six months ahead of the US release date.   Perhaps my favorite Asher novel up to now, although that is very hard to call, is The Skinner. The Voyage of the Sable Keech is every bit as good as The Skinner. I am not going to ruin the story by giving away the plot details but we pick up where we left off with The Skinner and get to boisterously romp around with all of our favorite characters from that novel once again. Well, the ones that survived anyway!!! This is a fantastic follow-up and a thoroughly enjoyable read replete with the same trademark action, mind-bending exploration of technology, and amazing characterization that those of us fortunate to have read his earlier work have come to expect. I highly encourage you to splurge, have Mastercard convert your dollars to pounds and order this directly from the UK. You won't be disappointed! Now, how long until I can get another fix? 
 Harlem is the center of black culture and history: Harlem World reveals a probe of the region which uses interviews with a cross-section of Harlem residents to offer new insights into the lives and attitudes of modern Harlem dwellers. What evolves is a multi-faceted examination of new Harlem lifestyles 
  Arthur Miller's play of responsibility and honor joins the ranks of The Crucible and Death of a Salesman as showcases of a master's talent. Little faults and criticisms popped into my mind throughout act two, but all the loose ends were covered in the last few pages.  The relationships seem to be the catching point, but they're only skin deep. Miller will really have you in complete sympathy with Joe until the time when his sins are completely revealed.  Although it is Joe that experiences a realization by the end of the play, Chris is the true protagonist. He's already come to terms with what Larry wanted to get across to everyone by the time the rest of the cast is even beginning to figure it out.  All My Sons may seem to be a mediocre play in acts one and two, but it will win you over if you give it a chance and really invest yourself in the themes. I would suggest reading Miller's previously mentioned masterpieces before this one, but don't allow it to be overlooked. 
 Rockport Publishers continues their long-running design book series with Letterhead & Logo Design 9, this volume by Christopher Simmons and his San Francisco design firm MINE. The designs presented in the book were selected from over 3000 submissions from identity designers in 38 states and 40 countries.   With a new spin on the publication series, the nearly 300 examples of logos, stationery packages, and other promotional items presented in this volume are organized by attributes, rather than the usual categorization by industry or type of client.  The selection of designs exhibited was based on beauty, wit and whimsy, simplicity, subtlety, virtuosity, typography, materiality and miscellany. The latest, and freshest, addition to the on-going Rockport collection will elicit many "damn, why didn't I think of that?" thoughts and provide a great deal of inspiration to any graphic designer with even the slightest interest in logo design.  - Jeff Fisher, writer of bLog-oMotives and "Logo Notions" at CreativeLatitude.co 
 I was at the Brighton concerts that these recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two stunning nights of music they can't be better. Standout tracks include the two by Martha Wainwright, the two by Teddy Thompson, Perla Batalla's "Bird on a Wire", Rufus' "Chelsea Hotel"  and (from the Sydney concert) Antony's  "If it be your Will". Two major disappointments though; the inclusion of U2 as backing band for Leonard Cohen's own version of "Tower of Song" seems done for purely commercial reasons and doesn't work,  and the nonsensical ommission of Linda Thompson's sublime take on "Alexandra Leaving". Here's hoping it's included on the dvd release 
 It's doubtful whether any pirate ever looked like Lancaster, rigged out in a succession of exaggeratedly modish outfits and bleached-blond hair... He is the 18th-century pirate swashbuckler to end all swashbucklers!  With his mute, but athletic side-kick friend Nick Cravat, Lancaster leads an island's people in rebellion against the tyrant Baron Gruda... His damsel is Eva Bartok, the freewheeling European beauty...   I don't know how many times I have seen this buccaneer saga, and still I love it... The film provides lots of thrills and laughs, lots of adventures and excitement ...   Great fun all the time...  Lancaster's sense of comedy was evident enough for critic Alton Cook to call him "one of our most amiable and strenuous comedians."  For me, Lancaster will be always remembered as the actor who has given the modern cinema more "pure enjoyment" than almost any other major star...   
 as a child and it is still as fun.. just never have anyone to play it with LO 
 These do a great job of enhancing your best feature.  These definately fit snugly.  If that is not your preference you will need to get one size larger.  They will sit a little lower on your backside than other underwear.  The only area on these that is not transparent is the pouch.  These underwear wil make you look great 
 This band rocks, live and recorded... buy this if you have good taste 
 This was a particularly good game for our younger kids, though our 9 year old was able to finish the entire game in a weekend.  Our 7 year old continues to enjoy it without the same degree of frustration that he experiences with some other games that are a bit too old for him.  This game was great even though the kids have not seen the movie 
 This is the first book that I have read of the Brother Cadfael Mysteries.  I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I was drawn into the world of medieval England that Peters brings to life.  "The Raven in the Foregate" is a quick read, entertaining and mysterious to the fact that there is not much mystery to the case at hand.  As usual, Brother Cadfael is drawn into the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of the newly instituted priest of Holy Cross, Father Ailnoth.  While he was alive, Ailnoth was quick to make enemies in the church and in the community; many are glad to see him dead, and many are content to hold their tongues as to the truth of what caused his death on Christmas Eve.  Complicating matters are the search for a French renegade who was undercover at Holy Cross in the guise of the nephew of Father Ailnoth's housekeeper.  Brother Cadfael must piece together the scant clues and abounding rumors to uncover the truth of Ailnoth's death.  "The Raven in the Foregate" is a well-written mystery, although at times too tidy and predictable.  It was a true delight to enter into the world of Holy Cross and medieval England that Peters has crafted throughout her Cadfael mystery series.   I look forward to reading the other books in the series. 
 Had seen the movie on STARZ but enjoyed it so much I wanted it in my library. Good Chick flick, somewhat of a tear jerker, but good none the less 
 Look, everything about going to Vegas is a gamble, but Frommers helped us cut the odds with every part or our trip. With the prices of shows there it was invaluable to have this guide help us pick. The author was absolutely right about "Blue Man Group" -- both the kids and adults loved them. And the only time we went against a Frommer's recommendation (choosing a buffet purely for convenience) was the only time we were disappointed. It was our own fault 
 I enjoyed this book for the most part. I feel the trip throught the Stargate could have been better developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the workings of the "mountain". The main characters were all there, participating in the problem solving.  There was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode, and some food for thought added in as well. Is the world really ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out there? I don't know but this book presents some interesting questions. I await the next book in the series 
 The best experience for this tea is at the actual Pike Place Market where they brew it so you can sample it in their charming little store past the flying fish and florist.  It is also really great to have any other time in your life and to share with everyone you meet.  Since every grocery store doesn't stock this wonderful tea you will have to order it and stock your kitchen/office/cabin/whatever with it and enjoy 
      This is an amazing service! For only 2 bucks i can watch what i like for the moment. In this case it was HG WELLS. Great biography 
 i thought this kit was a steal since it is a credible brand and it included all the basic needs that i use everyday for an extremely reasonable price. i don't use the lip gloss as much as the others because for me, the colors of the lip gloss don't match the natural look im going for. all the other products are out of this world though, they are very light and the liquid powder is like none ive seen before. you can put it on underneath or as a final layer and both work. i definitely recommend this kit because it works with EVERY skin tone. 
 I love this movie.  Bette Midler and Trini Alvarado deserve oscars in my oppinion.  "Stella" is about the relationship of a mother and daughter (in reality it could be any dysfuncional family) and how fate deals it's cards to the "unfortunate".  It doesn't help that Stella is jaded and a B@#$%. This movie captures a mother's maturnal instinct who wants the best for her only child.  Stella deals with the cards that are dealt to her in the game of life.  She is impoverished but well read and because of the "BS", OVER IT.  Bette Midler captures this type of character with a realness you rarely see on film.  I see similarities to my own mother so I guess that's why I can indentify with her.  Although I can practically memorize the dialogue it remains one of my favourite films. 
 This book is full of historical and factual material that is very helpful. The outlines are extra good and useable. The spritual insight is very challenging and preachable. The best commentary I have read on Genisus 
 This is vintage Foxtrot very funny even for first time readers

Spearman, Screenplay by Frank Butler and Karl Kamb, under the direction of director Leslie Fenton in glorious technicolor ~ "Whispering Smith" (1949/89 mins), featuring an all-star cast starting with ~ Alan Ladd (star of "Shane", one of the best westerns ever) as Luke "Whispering" Smith, Robert Preston (star of "Music Man", Broadway and Hollywood Musical as Professor Harold Hill) as Murray Sinclair, Brenda Marshall as Marian Sinclair, Donald Crisp (co-star in "How Green Was My Valley" as Mr. Gwilym Morgan) as Barney Rebstock the hated rancher who wanted to own the whole territory, William Demarest (from "My Three Sons" television series) as Bill Dansing, Faye Holden (Andy Hardy's Mother, Mrs Emily Hardy) as Emmy Dansing, Frank Faylen (cabdriver in "It's A Wonderful Life, one of Jimmy Stewart's good buddies) as Whitey DuSang the blood-thirsty killer with cold and mean snake eyes, Eddy Waller (Allan "Rocky" Lane's sidekick, Nugget) as the railroad conductor ~ all intermingle with a story that twists and turns, keeping the audience spellbound with action and riveting drama.

 In all of investment literature, there's nothing quite like the peek inside Soros's mind in his "real-time experiment." The only thing that comes close is Lefevre's _Reminiscences of a Stock Operator_. Even when Soros is wrong (like when he sees the 1987 crash as marking Japan's rise to world dominance, or in predicting a worldwide credit collapse in the late 80's), he is fascinating. The guy really is smarter than sin, and the writing gives you a sense of the kind of relentless energy as well as intellect he brought to his work.  His discussion of "Reagan's Imperial Circle," in which Reagan's aggressive military posturing coaxed inflows of foreign investment into US dollar-denominated currencies, thereby masking the massive inflation his military spending created, explains as well as anything the US's prosperity in the 1980s.  It also provides a road map, written twenty years ago, to what might happen now that those inflows, as well as the internally generated credit from Fed rate cuts have stopped. Inflation? Falling dollar? Is massive government spending really the Holy Grail politicians think today? Why did it not work for Johnson or Nixon, and work for Reagan? Will it work for Bush? Reading Soros greatly improves your understanding of the landscape that these questions come from.   I'm a dyed-in-the-wool value investor, and this is one of my three favorite investing books. Probably not for beginners, though 
 When I mentioned to my friend Carver Yu that I was reading this book, he scrunched up his face in the way that only a man who knows the field well can do and commented, `Well, of course, that book contains a fair bit of metaphysical speculation.'  Precisely.  That is what makes Hawking's attempt to simplify his original one-syllable-less A Brief History of Time such a beguiling reader for a non-specialist like me. Call it metaphysical speculation or call it a daring attempt to translate the astrophysicists' language into yours and mine without losing the power of asking us to imagine a world nearly completely different than the one we thought we lived in. Call it what you want, it's still a read well worth the effort it requires.  Don't shy away from finishing this book if you don't understand it all. Allow it the chance to paint an impressionistic portrait of what physicists--many of them justly awe-struck by the object of their inquiry--believe that they see `out there' when some of humanity's best minds ask the fundamental questions and follow the theories (theirs is a theory-rich pursuit) where they lead. Many of those theories, as Hawking describes them, will sound like nonsense.  Unless sense is different than we thought.  When I was at Cambridge, I used to bicycle past the severely disabled Stephen Hawking in his wheelchair, followed by his personal nurse, as he wheeled between home and office, his mind no doubt drifting far from the concrete course of his wheelchair across the Commons. One wonders whether paragraphs of Briefer History and other of his works were taking shape as our paths crossed.  Metaphysical speculation for those who dare to imagine things they may not fully understand. Things like wormholes, peabrains, and a universe curved so severely that words almost fail in the explaing of it.  If that sounds provocative enough to justify the effort, this book is for you 
 Well I'm about half way through the book now, and though I must say  that I can't put it down, it has been giving me some nightmares. I'm not claiming to believe that the things Russ writes about are true, but they certainly are disturbing. I recommend this book to anyone interested in... "Disinformation" 
 Krovetz haas written a book that will help those involved in thinking about how to make our schools work for all children. The idea is that if we create a nurturing yet academically challenging culture, we can provide a climate in which all chiildren can flourish. Through the case studies we see how each school has encated the ideas, bringing them to life, and showing us the possibilities as well as the difficulties 
 In my opinion the book Small Steps is a superb book that I could not put down until; I was finished with it. It starts off wacky and funny but wraps it's self into one good fun book. I am sure that you will love this book as much as I did. This has to be one of the best books that I have ever read. 
      The two authors were definitely experts in the field and provided thorough discussion of all aspects of knee replacement, before, during, and after.  One of the authors had both of his knees replaced.  How could anyone know more than an expereinced physical therapist who also had the surgery himself?  
 I used to watch this on VHS with my brother when he'd come home & visit us on his college breaks. Raising Arizona has always been a favorite of mine. It's easy to see why. Nicolas Cage & Holly Hunter are hilarious in this. The beginning sequence where he goes into prison again reminds me of coming into my own job each day and seeing the same, sad & bitter faces like always. My absolute favorite part is the chase scene with the dogs and the clerk from the store. This movie is pretty dark, so beforwarned if your one of those that prefers happy tidy rosy canned Hollywood movies. This is anything but ordinary. I can't even liken it to anything else. If unusual is what you crave, then add this to your collection. You won't be sorry 
 This is the first Sidney Bechet CD I've purchased and it surely won't be the last.  I've gone all these years knowing little of him, finally checking out his sound after seeing that he made Woody Allen's celebrity itunes list.  The man was an absolute master with the soprano saxophone and clarinet.  Moreover in this collection of songs ranging from 1939 to 1953 he plays in quintets and sextets featuring such excellent musicians as Art Hodges on piano and Wild Bill Davidson on the cornet.  But it is Bechet who shines.  His style variably evokes New Orleans Jazz, the Blues traditional jazz and a hint of swing.  Like Ben Webster, Lester Young and other geniuses, Bechet creates a mood with his horn.  It's hard to listen to while doing anything else because you'll want to sit back and enjoy -- and enjoy you will

 Lost and Found was an excellent contemporary romance after so much historical romance.  It was well written and fun to read.  Enjoy ! 
 I bought this book a few years ago and I found it very helpful. The information is presented in an interesting way.   The photographs are period black and white photographs. Color photography did not exist at the time the photos were taken.   The black and white drawings are detailed and beautiful. 
 As a physicist I want to find a book to refresh my memory on theoretical mechanics. I came across this one, and after reading its first 4 chapters in continuation, I kow I don't need any other book. What a treat! Written by a past master, the book costs you next to nothing; yet as it's written by sure hand, it hasn't slightest pretention, just plain and insightful, natural and smoth flow, leads you almost effortlessly fowward. Even though I learned the subject before, I don't know of or even imagine a better exposition. Wow, I started to love Russian mathematicians 
 I was thrilled with this book. All Laurie Anderson fans should get this.. From those that discovered her in the 70's to those who came on board with "O Superman" or "home of the brave" and subsequent  projects, its got it all (mostly).  Beatufilly rendered photos, and text..i  can't give it 6 stars 
 A Killer is at work in Minneapolis. Two bodies are found- both are treated as unrelated but a games creator Grace McBride knows different. Some how these games are exact copies of that in a game that she's designing. As the copycat killings mount up, Grace knows that she and her Monkeywrench team are both suspects and potential victims. With the serial killer getting closer, she is drawn into a murderous game of cat and mouse.  This is a thrilling page turner with a nail biting finish. Hope you enjoy i 
 In the academic world, where the liberal arts have in recent years been virtually taken over by neo-feminist academics, Warren Farrell dares to tread upon their turf.  Boldly, if somewhat recklessly, Warren Farrell dares to block the way of 21st century feminism in the tradition of the tank-stopper at Tiananmen Square. Dr. Farrell of course differs from that brave Chinese man -- the chinese tanker whom he challenged chose not to open fire upon him. Farrell, on the other hand, has been taking bullets from feminists since the day he realized he had become a lapdog for the National Organization of Women. For any  father who cares about his young son's future, and any mother of a young son with the courage to face the truths which Farrell exposes, this is a must-read.  As a young father, I too towed the feminist company line, reminding my sons dutifully as they grew up that "girls can do anything that boys do". Until I watched as my son and his friends turned 18, reaching the age when the government forces indentureship upon him as a future paid professional killer while the girls who played on his Little League teams suddenly found themselves at the sidelines for the "game" of war.  Speaking of war, if you read this book closely you will see that it has been written by a man who has climbed the heights only to realize that his ascent has been to the academic gallows -- a prisoner of the Battle of the Sexes, in a war already lost by men to women decades ago 
      The circumstances, possibilities, and issues concerning Christianity in New Zealand are a microcosm of these elsewhere in the Western world. This multidisciplinary work aims to inform readers of perspectives and realities regarding contemporary Christianity not reflected or suggested in the popular media. Focus on certain anomalies is especially revealing, as well as to some degree predictive of Christianity's possible future depending on how these are resolved. Kevin Ward, a lecturer of Church issues in the modern world, explores how the "fragmentation and religious pluralism" in postmodernism not only limit and distort understanding of beliefs and developments in Christianity, but also shape strategies for Christians wishing to be a part of modern culture. "Believing Without Belonging" is part of the title of Ward's article. Another by Bruce Knox, Executive Director of Bible College in New Zealand, explores the apparent anomaly that "Christian Allegiance Is Declining, Yet Theological Education Is Booming." The role of religion in shaping the New Zealand national identity, even as the nation was "set up more or less decisively independent of any denominational church influence," is another relevant topic; while a couple of other articles take up political solutions for dealing with the desire of Christians to see their beliefs and values reflected more plainly in government policies and activity. The number of articles by theologians, historians, and sociologists, among others, with their fingers on the pulse of contemporary Christian situations and concerns offer a variety of views on the persistent matter of religion in contemporary life and current affairs. 
 As you might guess from the title, this book talks about airborne operations conducted against the Soviet Bloc during the cold war. It includes not only operations against Russia, but also the covert operations during the Viet Nam war, operations against Cuba, etc.   As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think of the older book "Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage" by Sherry Sontag, Christopher Drew, and Annette Lawrence Drew.   I didn't realize just how close we and the Russians were going at each other during the Cold War. We are very, very lucky that some of these incidents didn't turn out to be really nasty.   The one thing that I kept expecting in this book was more on the RB-47 intrusions into Russia during the late 1950's and early 1960's. It is my understanding that about 40 US planes were shot down with a loss of a couple of hundred men.   One thing that I really liked about the book was the summary chapter at the end. His analysis of what we did, what the Russians were doing and the results were surprising and very informative. I'd like to see this part expanded another fifty pages or so in the next edition.   Meanwhile it's still a great book, get it and "Blind Man's Bluff. 
 Stepping off the train in Kyoto for the first time can be a disappointing experience for many travelers. People who have fallen in love with the fairy tale of Japan's old capitol, who have absorbed "Memoirs of a Geisha," and swooned at photographs of golden temples, paper lanterns, and beautiful, elusive Geisha fleeing quickly through close, wooded back-allies, are shocked to discover a modern, dirty city, overrun with power lines, buses and hotels. Furthermore, it is stacked to the gills with tourists, each seeking their own Kyoto-of-my-dreams. Where are the secret spaces, the ancient houses and quiet tea houses steeped in history? Diane Durston can tell you.   If you are anything like me, "Old Kyoto: A Guide to Traditional Shops, Restaurants and Inns" is the guide to the Kyoto you are looking for. A fascinating and delightful guide to the relics of old Kyoto, the stuff that you see on the post cards but can't seem to find in the city itself, Diane Durston has dredged the sludge of a modern city to find things like Nishiharu, a small tatami-room shop selling authentic Ukiyo-e prints with a proprietor who greets each guest with a cup a tea and a smile, or Ippo-Do, a 140-year old tea shop who's name ("One Promise") and business is based on a promise to an old customer that they would never sell anything but tea, and Tawara-ya, an inn so beautiful that when the King of Sweden stayed there, he was late for his official tour do to lingering too long in the morning light of the garden.   As a guide, "Old Kyoto" is divided into regions, Central Kyoto, Eastern Kyoto, Western Kyoto, Northern Kyoto and Southern Kyoto, and then showcasing a few treasures of each region, splitting evenly amongst craftwear, antiques, Japanese-style hotels, restaurants and food-sellers. Many of these shops are tiny, without even a sign out in front to advertise their business. Some carry ancient placards announcing them as official providers to the Emperor of their unique offering. All of them are tempting enough to include more than a few when visiting Kyoto.   Each entry is a loving, well-written essay, and Diane Durston paints an affectionate picture of the store and its proprietors. You can tell that she carries each of these shops in her heart, and one shop, a traditional bucket-maker, is included in fond remembrance, even though the craftsman himself has passed away with no one to pass his craft to.   In addition to the shop introductions, there are a few extras, such as a guide to walks through old Kyoto, and recommended day-trips to places such as Fushimi and Uji which are easily accessible from Kyoto city. While these are a nice addition, there are other, more-inclusive guide books for this kind of thing.   "Old Kyoto" is an essential guide to anyone seeking that city that they have read so much about. It is still there, you just have to know where too look for it. Fortunately for us, Diana Durston knows where to look, and has kindly shown us the way 
 Bridget Jones, modern day woman, brillant and doesn't know it, prone to accidents and mess ups but manages to come out of them.    This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever.  Bridget Jones is my hero!  
 I read this book and am now ordering another copy so each of my girls will have one as they grow up.  You will laugh, you will cry and you will be challenged in your walk with the Lord 
 This is a comprehensive book on panning. Two things stand out for me. One, there is a by-the-numbers recipe for wet panning that is more detailed than any other book that I have read. Two, this is the only work that describes,  in detail, dry panning 
 Subtle, stunning and important book about the religious upheavals in 16th  century England- Here the period suddenly comes vividly alive- Brigden  writes with a fantastic level of texture- injecting life into the city, the  people, the faiths and the battles.  This is one of my models for great  modern historical writing style - tightly argued, adorned with memorable  anecdotal gems, and always entertaining while effortlessly persuading the  reader.   I don't understand why its out of print- its more like a great  biography than dry historical research- a perfect entree to the period for  the lay reader as well as student- really one of the greats 
 This well-illustrated, simply written book encompasses several lessons in one--colors, train cars, and physics displayed in pictures of the moving freight train.  The words have a steady tempo that keep a young listener's attention while capturing his gaze with the detailed pictures of each train car and its associated words painted in a different shade of the rainbow--making it easier to learn your colors.  A timeless classic that your child will continue to enjoy again and again 
 The most enjoyable "text book" that I ever read -- and I learned a lot!  I wish O'Rourke was one of my economics professors in college.  However, he is younger than I 
 Danny Seo has the rare gift of making daunting tasks seem possible, even easy.  This book has so many idea gems that have changed my life - inspiring me to make both small and major changes in how I interact with the environment and my immediate surroundings.  I eagerly await his next book as I'm due for more inspiration.  
 I bought this dvd on a whim while looking for books about martial arts kicks.  I did not expect too much but was pleasantly surprised.  Master Day explains in detail how to do kicks from simple to advanced.  The exercises for the advanced kicks are coming in handy as I work on spinning jumping kicks such as the hurrican kick.  I do not practice Hapkido but rather I practice tradtional Taekwon-do.  I think any kicking art would find this dvd useful 
 Ever had one of those grating experiences where everyone is gathered around the piano singing "Jingle Bells," and some show off feels the need to jazz things up and starts throwing in that "I Like A Sleigh Ride" riff at the end of every other phrase.  Yes, I hate those people too.  And I am shocked, shocked that it now appears that we may have Miss Peggy Lee to blame for that particular, uh, innovation.  Well, I (along with Bette Midler and Maria Muldaur and just about everybody else these days) just love Peggy Lee, so I can't stay mad  Besides, unlike the drunken show off at your Christmas party, Lee does this kind of thing exquisitely.  Her elegant stylings and cool delivery are unbeatable, and allow her rise over all kinds of Yuletide silliness.  The children's choir that appears on many of these tracks would normally have me headed for the door, but as a counterpoint to Lee's elegant coolness, they're almost bearable.  In the 50s and 60s, of course, nearly every pop singer was obliged to do a Christmas album or five over the course of his or her career.  If Peggy Lee seemed the epitome of supperclub chic, she still apparently loved kids and dogs (especially Lady and the Tramp) and had as much of sentimental side as any Rat Packer.  So if the thought of a Peggy Lee Christmas album has you wishing for something on the order of "Black Coffee...and Pumpkin Pie" or "Santa Gives Me Fever," forget it.  This is much more conventional holiday fare.  Or is it?  Well, Lee would not be Lee if she didn't jazz things up at least slightly.  Aside from the above mentioned, "I Like A Sleigh Ride" twist, she also starts off her version of "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" with a sly, "Dig that Santa comin' to Town."  Can you get more 50s hip than that?  And with the ballads, well, a woman can get away with "White Christmas" without being compared to der Bingle or with "The Christmas Song" without being negatively contrasted with Nat King Cole.  And at first hearing, you may find these tracks pleasant enough alternative takes.  But listen again.  You may find--as did I--that Lee's subtle phrasing forces you to listen to those old lyrics in a new way.  She gives weight to each word, like a good jazz singer should.  The versions here are truly remarkable.  And Lee could be warm as well as (as she is so often described) sultry.  So a Christmas album from the woman who immortalized "Fever" is NOT a contradiction in terms. It's just another example of this singer's consummate musicianship.   Despite being an old hippie, I love the old classic singers and in Lee's case, am ecstatic to see her still getting deserved attention almost four years after her death.  Thank you, Bette, and thank you, Maria, for bearing the torch.  And thank you, Miss Peggy Lee, for starting the fire.  God rest ye, gentle lady 
 This beautiful book is for every woman who is seeking insight, perspective and wisdom on life -- and isn't every woman?  Spragins gives us indelible portraits of women we admire and look up to, and the letters themselves are candid, open and altogether moving.  I thought I would give the book a quick browse, and found it impossible to put down.  The voices of these marvelous women stay with me.  A perfect gift for daughters,  mothers, wives --  a perfect book club book -- and a great gift for yourself 
 This album reminds me of why I miss 90s hip hop.  Ever since his guest appearance on Illmatic, AZ has been considered by me & some others as one of the best in the game.  Tight lyrics, strong production, you just can't go wrong with this album.  If your a fan of early Nas, Jay-Z, Biggie, and just 90s rap in general, this is a must have to your collection 
 "Mama used to say" was the reason I bought the CD.  I found the rest of the disc above-average.  For Junior fans - get it at a good price and enjoy it.  For others, borrow the disk from someone and give it a chance, you may end up buying it for yourself!  Four stars! 
 McCullough's biographies and histories are among the best available, combining superb scholarship with easy reading, and this history of the Brooklyn Bridge is superb.   While I was carrying this around, several people asked why I was reading it, and three immediate answers came to mind: First, because it's a great read! This is every bit as good as most novels, and more fun that most. Second, it's a wonderful study in character. When most of our news is filled with controversy and scandal, here are two men (father and son) who stood as exemplars of honesty, determination, courage and faithfulness. If you want someone to model your life after, I recommend either of these men - or Emily Roebling, Washington's wife and assistant. And third, because 130 years later, the Brooklyn Bridge remains one of America's great engineering feats, as well as a work of art.  The father, John Roebling, was a true genius. Arriving from Germany as a young man, he founded a city (Saxonburg), perfected the concept of suspension bridges, and built one of the great companies of the 19th century. Then in a tragic accident during the preliminary surveys for the bridge, he was injured and died a horrible death of tetanus shortly afterward.   His son, Washington, took over work on the bridge and devoted the next fourteen years of his life to seeing it through. The details of the construction, by themselves, make this an amazing read!  This is one of those books that  may not come up as a topic in most social situations, but it'll make you a better person and you'll like yourself for having read it. It's not a casual weekend read, but it's well worth the effort. Highly recommended. 
 This advice for writing serial romances, alternately attributed to Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens, and Charles Reade, is epitomized in this 1860 novel by Collins, a story of thwarted love, a marriage of obligation, claims on inheritance, the victimization of women, and, most of all, engaging mystery.  Collins, often credited as the father of the mystery genre, creates a fast-paced story of Victorian England, revealing much about Victorian society and its values--the role of women, the laws governing marriage and inheritance, the social institutions of the day, the contrasting attitudes toward the aristocracy and the lower classes, and even the level of medical care and the treatment of psychological illness.  When drawing master Walter Hartright is on his way to teach Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie at Limmeridge House, in Cumberland, England, he meets a "woman in white," a young woman who knows Limmeridge House well because she was mentored by Mrs. Fairlie, Laura Fairlie's deceased mother.  The "woman in white" is Anne Catherick, who looks just like Laura, but who is an escapee from a nearby mental asylum.  Upon his arrival at Limmeridge House, Walter immediately falls in love with the beautiful Laura, but she has made a deathbed pledge to her father to marry to Sir Percival Glyde, someone Anne Catherick despises and blames for her own incarceration.  Throughout the novel, Anne visits various characters to offer help in combating Sir Percival and his cohorts.  The story unfolds through documents held by a variety of characters, each of whom tells the story from his/her own point of view.  The reader develops sympathy for the innocent and beautiful Laura, respect for her homely but bright half-sister, Marian Halcombe, sadness for Walter Hartright, and hatred for Sir Percival and his friend, the Italian count Fosco, with whom Sir Percival is in business.  Sir Percival and the count need financing, and it is Laura's inheritance that is at stake.  A series of consecutive disasters, along with arguments, revelations of abuse, the fear of exposure, and the contemplation of murder by Sir Percival and Count Fosco, draws the reader irrevocably into the action.  The characters are sympathetically drawn, with Collins showing an early awareness of the influence of psychology on behavior.  The descriptions of nature, presented realistically and in  minute detail, build suspense, as Collins creates parallels between nature and the details of plot.  As is usually the case with romances, chance plays a huge role in the unfolding action, creating cliff-hanging suspense which contributes to the excitement--and pure fun--of this seductive novel.  The conclusion, involving a subplot unrelated to the primary action, resolves issues conveniently.  The almost-forgotten author of twenty-five novels, Collins was one of the most successful authors of Victorian mysteries, and he is gaining new attention as a result of reprints of this novel and The Moonstone.  n Mary Whipple  
 "Putting the Days to Bed" is like the sun: it shines and burns in equal measure and it's necessary to sustain life.   Each of the eleven songs are meticulously crafted and range from insanely catchy ("Teaspoon" with its vampy horns) to punch-in-the-gut aching ("Would you say that I/ was the last thing you want/ to remember me by" from "Seven"). On "Hindsight" singer/songwriter John Roderick matches Dylan ("Are you still training for the big race/ by hoping the runners will die") and Roderick's vocals soar and invite throughout the entire disc.  Unfailingly melodic, jaunty and kinetic, "PtDtB" is a big ball of wonderful. Rock it and then rock it again 
 Teaching high school poetry is tough--Emily, Walt--the classic poets scarcely inform the world of the average stoner/slacker/skater high school kid.  This book will help break through and open the world of poetry to those who really need it.  During five years of teaching at an alternate public high school, I bought half a dozen of these, for other teachers, for especially promising students, to replace copies boosted from the classroom.  It's "school inappropriate" in many ways--raw, profane, real, gross--it takes real balls to use this book in public schools, but the kids will love it.  
 I was pulled to this title via news of the Adrian Tomine-written introduction. The material there and in the prodigious Optic Nerve artist's interview with Tatsumi (also included) bolster an already astounding collection of short stories in comics. Tatsumi's male protagonists wreak of the the unlikeably distanced and misanthropic worldviews of Charles Bukowski's work, but the salient simplicity of Tatsumi's stories within scripts of several pages apiece is Hemingwayesque in its poignant and open-ended "conclusions." This is a book for lovers of adult manga, R. Crumb, Tomine, Harvey Pekar, or really any other realm of colorfully personal comics narratives. Fascination with selfishly disdainable male characters can only bring one further into these stories--ranging from tales of mutilated factory workers to Western military presence in Japan. All of them, however, orbit around the plights of men who can't relate, can't get ahead, or just plain can't like themselves in a crowded Japanese urban environment 
 This battery, if purchased from North East Power and Battery, is not the Canon BP-945, but an equivelent.  If you are looking for the actual one from Canon, I suggest buying it straight from Amazon, not from North East Power and Battery 
 Having read many books concerning Islam, including the Quran and several publications from Muslim sources, I find this book as good as they come.  It is honest and balanced, answering questions from original sources without being either caustic or compromising.  The author writes authoritatively from both inside and outside his "birth religion", comparing and contrasting his subjects even-handedly, but demonstrating that apart from interesting coincidental items their character and integrity are at opposite ends of the religious/political and moral spectrum.  He leaves his readers in no doubt that one was a man who began with ambition and employed force to promote himself and his religion, while the other is unique in the strictest sense of the word in His character, love, power and supreme position.  Who's who comes through clearly and convincingly 
 I found this book to be better than I expected!  Cassie the main character is well wriiten!  I really enjoyed and couldn't put the book down 
 The test of a good book lies in its readability, more so in the case of a non fiction.The author's narrative style is simple and interesting and hence very readable. As I read through the book I felt as if I was travelling with the author through this life journey of hers. What makes  the book acceptable is the fact that the author does not make any judgement  about the cultures that she has to be in. Her attempt to combine the best  of both the worlds is the main attraction in the book. I agree with her  totally that the need of the hour is holistic approach to any medical  intervention. Coming from India I do understand the gap in the modern  approach to 'cure', namely the 'healing'. I wish many non native Indians  would read this book and benefit from its facts.I wish the doctor all the  very best in her present endevour of popularising the holistic approach  among the modern medical world 
 I whole-heartedly agree with other reviewers. This book is a treasure in the midst of competing texts that simply do not offer the quality of Kelley's textbook.  This book does what others simply fail to do. Provide comprehensive, *practical*, and evidence-based medical management guidelines. Whereas most standard texts may provide such information about disease entities, Kelley's also recognises that patients most often present with diagnostic problems (such as hematuria or tremors) and thus devotes much attention to these. Each of these presentations is examined in terms of differentials (not just a list - you are given perspective and told what to look for in different subpopulations that present with the same complaint), then workup, treatment options, and followup considerations are explored. Facts aren't simply printed for the purpose of memorization (as is often the case in other texts); they are contextualized and presented in a manner that is useful to your goal of providing thorough and effective management options to your patients. I would also recommend this texts to medical students, as it is far easier to absorb information that is clinically and practically relevant rather than memorize those lists and flow diagrams (which at first glance may look concise and easy to study, but in the long term are actually difficult to remember).  Dr A.M 
 Those familiar with the work of Charles Pellegrino know that his writing always drifts from the distant past to the present to the distant future, connecting disparate circumstances together into a coherent "big picture" by way of entertaining discourses on paleontology, archeology, biology, and astrophysics, to name but a few of the fields Mr. Pellegrino has worked in. In "Her Name, Titanic", the disparate events in question are the sinking of the ocean liner Titanic in 1912 and its discovery on the ocean floor in 1985, as well as subsequent missions to document the Titanic's wreckage more fully. "Her Name, Titanic" presents previously unpublished information about the sinking of the Titanic in the form of fictionalized narratives and direct quotes from survivors, based on newly discovered (at the time of writing) diaries and communication logs. There is much discussion of the technology and accomplishments of deep sea exploration, including  interviews with Bob Ballard and other members of the teams that discovered and explored the Titanic wreckage. I didn't like "Her Name, Titanic" as much as I usually like Charles Pellegrino's books. This book actually focuses on one subject more than most of his books do, which turned out not to be a good thing. I found Pellegrino's enthusiasm to be somewhat less infectious than usual, as the middle portion of the book bogged down with too much talk about deep sea submersibles. Of course, if this is your field of interest, you may find that part of the book fascinating. Titanic aficionados will be thrilled to read new accounts of what happened that night in April 1912. I give the new information 5 stars and the more tedious aspects of the book 3 stars, so 4 stars as a whole 
 This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could read it over and over.  Whereas many books about politicians are very dull, this one is the first one I found I couldnt put down. John Adams personal letters and his descriptions of our nation's capitol at that time makes you feel as if you were there. For the first time for many people you can get a real handle on what the REvolution was all labout. I do desperately wish this book was available in my high school history classes in the 1940's. Every young person in school today should read this book in addition to their class history books. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed the dancing.  Macaulay Culkin seemed awkward; he should not have been in the movie.  A dancer should have played his part 
 Note the title carefully, this book is about the Game BUSINESS. It is not a programming manual, it is not on how to design games, it is about the business aspects of the gaming industry. It is written by professionals in that business.  This book is a collection of some twenty-six essays written by professionals in all aspects of the game business. They are broken down into five sections:   The Game Business Then and Now  Publishers and Developers  Startups  Bringing Games to Market  Managing Game Production.   The essays vary in quality and content. Some are much better written than others, some don't seem to have much in either quality or content. All in all, a professional in the gaming industry probably knows all this, but that's not who the book is for. If, on the other hand, you are thinking of starting a gaming software company, there's a lot here.   This is the second edition of the book, updated and expanded 
 Whether you enjoy cooking good home food for your family, or if you simply enjoy a great book to read, Laurie Colwin is your author.  I'm no chef, but I loved this book.  I felt as though Laurie and I had become friends, and I was deeply saddened to learn that she passed away in 1992.  She tells great stories, gives good advice, and never overwhelms you with instructions or information (quite the opposite, in fact!).  Her relaxed and conversational style of writing, and her reassurance that she wouldn't do it either if it weren't easy, encourages you to feel you too can make a delicious meal, bake your own bread, and still have a life!  Unlike Martha Stewart, who often makes me feel overwhelmed, inadequate, or ill-equipped... Laurie makes you feel like she's dishing with you right in your own kitchen, and is very candid about her shortcuts and lack of kitchen tools.  I wish I could have been friends with Laurie Colwin... but the next best thing is to read this book.  ENJOY 
 The book makes no discussion about the fact that in the case of incompatibility one should really get out of a relationship. It then is better geared to people already in a loving realationship. 
 This novel seeks to unmask what greed and desire can do to people, while commenting on society and its affect on women of the period 
 Those who enjoy BDB's lovely piano-based ballades from previous albums will want to check out Born in the UK, which gives a heavy dose of the heavy-hearted piano songs similar to Wildebeast. The lyrics range from the mundane, two lovers going separate paths, to the more provocative--struggling to affirm life in the presence of evil and suffering. If you like this type of music, you might check out the similar crooning from Magnet, Page France, Ronderlin, Midlake, and Radio Dept. 
 If a great art, no matter the medium, is judged on the emotions it can elicit from the audience, then Wally Lamb's "I Know This Much Is True" should go down as one of this generation's masterpieces.  I found it hard to put down.  I found myself thinking about it at work and looking forward to lunch just so I'd have 30 or 40 minutes alone with it.  The worst part of this book is when its over because you know you're done.  One thing I have to look forward to when I'm old and possibly senile is re-reading this work and having be all new to me.  Get it and read it, you'll find yourself finding all kinds of parallels to your own life in all kinds of surprising places.  I look forward to his next work 
 Larry Randers is your average successful Los Angeles attorney, whose life is falling apart. He has just been through a painful divorce, and all his possessions have lost their luster and value. After the events of September 11, 2001, Larry takes his dog, Zeus, for what is supposed to be a vacation at Juniper Tree National Park. Zeus has other ideas.  Zeus is not just a talking dog. He leads Larry on a spiritual journey that turns his concept of reality inside out. They meet a talking juniper tree, ephemeral Native American masters, and all sorts of other beings who tell a fascinating story.  According to various cultures, including the Mayans, Hopis and the Bible, a planetary shift in consciousness is coming soon. Approximately 70 million highly evolved beings called Wanderers, have agreed to incarnate on Earth to help with the transition. Part of the deal is that they pass through the Veil of Forgetting, to temporarily forget who, and what, they are. At least, it was supposed to be temporary. This novel is an attempt to reach the rest of the Wanderers, those who know that they are "different," but can't put their finger on it.  The famous saying says "When the student is ready, the teacher appears." I must not be ready, because I had a hard time "getting" this book. I do not mean to imply for a minute that this is any sort of bad book, because it isn't. It's a very interesting story, especially for those who know their way around the worlds of spirituality and metaphysics. I am sure that this book has helped, and will help, a lot of people. I am just not one of them.  
 Came on time and in great condition.  I use a lot of European recepies, so I stumble on a lot of metric measurements; so I am happy to know that this scale provides weight in grams/kilos/lbs/oz.  Very useful to me as I cook a lot from scratch 
 After reading this, one understands the high suicide rate in Sweden, especially in the 70s! Though that might sound like a joke, the peronality of Swedish pop culture and the serious, non-emotional vibe that prevailed in the Swedish 70s is obvious here. The amount of public ridicule this group endured in their own country and abroad while simultaneously battling through emotional issues internally, produced the most hilarious irony in pop music...the mega-happy ABBA sound. It would seem as if none of the 4 members of ABBA were particularly joyful people.  In fact in some cases, they seem quite egotistical and morose. I appreciate this book because people that have always seen them as shadowy nordic figures that make mechanical yet irresistable pop product, will now see their human side...if they REALLY care to 
 I have found the many of the same things to be true as the previous reviewer.  If you want a brighter Elixir, they also make NanoWeb versions with a lighter coating.  They do wear out quicker though.  Before I started using Elixirs, my favorite strings were D' Addario 80/20 Phosphor Bronze.  I could get 3 sets for the price of 1 set of Elixirs.  I really found the Elixir's price to be a bit of a shock, but used them for a few months.  On a whim, I went back to the other strings.  I never noticed how quickly they oxidized and went dead before!  I've gone back and stayed with Elixir.  I've also tried the D' Addario EXP and Dean Markley Alchemy coated strings.  They were okay, but I found the Elixirs looked and sounded better longer.  Downsides? The uncoated strings show wear spots and oxidize long before the coated ones.  Also, as the coating wears off, I've found the strings get "fuzzy."  Overall, I still end up changing stings a lot less than I used to.  One star deducted for the high price.    
 Once you've been to Ondaatje's Africa and secluded Italian villa, you will never be the same again. His character studies of how four damaged souls converge melds seamlessly with a poignant narrative of love and loss 
 Tells me more about wine than I really need to know, but it's nice to have it handy 
 Earle presents historical stories for several peoples who were in Bronze Ages at different periods.  For each, he weaves together anthropology, sociology, environmental impact, and economics.  For anyone who finds it difficult to imagine how there could have been "economics" prior to the Age of Industrialization, this is a very helpful book.   I used this book when teaching a course on Economic History, precisely because I wanted my students to appreciate what economics means and how it exists in every society, even primative ones.  Earle's accounts of Bronze Age Hawaiian chiefdoms or primitive Danish Bronze Age communities, etc. demonstrated this perfectly while making it fun at the same time.  (In how many Economics courses will you study about indicators of economic status and feather capes?) Anyone who thinks that he or she is interested in anthropology or sociology, but nothing so dry as economics, need only pick up Earle's book, to see how much fun economics reading CAN be. This is a very unique book that satisfies a niche in the field of economics exceedingly well.  
 I recently read Jack Uldrich's previous book, The Next Big Thing is Realy Small: How Nanotechnology Will Change the Future of Your Business, and I enjoyed it so much that I asked Amazon.com to alert me when his next book came out.  I was a little surprised when I received an email from Amazon.com telling me that his next book was about Lewis & Clark (I was expecting and hoping for another high-tech book.)  Nevertheless, I decided to give it a read (it's a quick read) and was thoroughly delighted with it.  In fact, in many ways, it was even better than his first book.  Uldrich is the rare business consultant--he understands that regardless of how good or exciting new emerging technologies are, they are worthless in the hands of businesses or organizations that don't have good, strong, capable leaders.  I strongly encourage any business leader or executive who is struggling to lead their organization through these technologicaly-challenging times to spend an evening with this book.  I guarantee you that it will be time well spent 
 Very Good.  I have learned a lot about managing challenging problems with challenging patients.Cognitive therapists in training can't miss it 
 Even though this is about 4 years old, it is extremely halarious.  I've been waiting to see a good stand up comedy. The first 15 min is just one hilarious hit after another. I love this guy 
 This album is delightful, provided you are already familiar with Pinback. Check them out if you are a fan of the west-coast indie-emo sound. 
 I was lucky enough to have found Brunner's Stand on Zanzibar a few weeks ago and enjoyed it so much I looked around for The Sheep Look Up. Wow. How could I have missed reading this classic from over 30 years ago? There are many great reviews of this book here on amazon that acknowledge both the relevance and power of Brunner's vision. It is a more depressing and horrific book to read then a typical genre book due to the convincing portrayal of our culturally driven hubris, denial and greed. The American public has a short memory when it comes to their own complicity with corporate and political atrocities and this book serves as a shocking reminder. When I first read reviews of The Sheep Look Up I was afraid that it might be too didactic or too much of a diatribe to be entertaining, but after the first hour or so I was hooked on its gripping human drama. It is a bit challenging to read; there are lots of characters (more like sketches), and Brunner floods the pages with a cacophony of text from press releases, radio announcements, conversations, etc., that takes time for the reader to assimilate. But unlike a lot of other apocalyptic tales, this one is worth your time 
 A very incisive title that bites right into the flesh of the problem. All the problems that matter are discussed here in this book and no stone is left unturned. Vivid examples and real life situations are used as cased studies and as examples on which fictional problems are projected and solved. This innovative way of detailing a complicated and cruel world has to be widely appreciated, along with the easy structure and understandable language. An overall excellent book with little or now flaws, a book that should be read by all that want to have anything to do with music promoting and marketing. 
 I first read this book in elementary school, wrote a paper on it in college and continue to think about it as an adult.  It truly has the mark of inspired work.  I love how it crosses cultures and gets to the heart of what it is to be a living being in our world.  As some of the other reviews may show, not all children will connect with the message here.  It can't be forced, but if it does happen, they will have something wonderful to carry with them through life.  
 Reading Pollack's book there are some conclusions that I came to.He makes a good case arguing why it would be dangerous for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.Not only have they been supporters of terrorism,they have also been directly involved in committing terroristic acts against Western countries,including the United States.Considering the track record of the regime in Tehran there is no way that they should be allowed to get their hands on an atomic bomb.  BUT!From my reading of Pollacks' book,the only way that you could guarantee that Iran would not develop nuclear weapons would be to remove the present government.That means either orchestrating a coup (which Pollack explains is unlikely to happen),or invading Iran and deposing the government by force.Given what happened to the U.S. in Iraq,invading Iran is not a likely option.The problem isn't that the US military wouldn't be able to defeat Iran's armed forces,the problem is that they'd have to occupy the country afterward.Iran is 4 times the size of Iraq with 3 times the population.Given that in the estimate of General Eric Shinseki you needed several hundred thousand troops to occupy Iraq (between 300 and 400 thousand troops)* you would need at least the same number to occupy Iran and probably even more.So we're talking about a force of several hundred thousand troops possibly even up to a million.How long could the United States keep a force that size in Iran?   Nor does bombing Iran seem to be the answer.Iran has over 2 dozen nuclear facilities (that we know about) scattered throughout the country.Pollack argues that you wouldn't be able to destroy them all in a sneak attack.Instead,any air attack would have to be sustained and conducted over several weeks-perhaps even longer.Of course the Iranians have their own air-defense system which, unlike the Iraqi one,is not in a state of disrepair.So if you were planning a bombing campaign,you'd have to take out Iran's air defenses first.This raises the possibility that while the United States attacked Iran's defenses,the Iranians might dismantle some of their equipment and move it to secret locations.As Pollack points out,in the end,even after you'd destroyed all of Iran's nuclear facilities you couldn't be guaranteed that you'd destroyed all of their equipment.  The bottom line is that there are no good solutions for dealing with the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.Any military option you consider is likely to create as many problems as it solves.Pollack's aim I think,in writing this book is to be upfront with the American public and warn them that there is no quick and easy answer.  * PBS Frontline.James Fallows quoted in "The Invasion of Iraq".Interview conducted Jan.28,2004.Available at www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/invasion/interviews/fallows.htm 
 I love Gerber Onesies!  They do tend to run small, but they were the only ones that fit my 7lb newborn.  He is now 6 weeks and about 10lbs and still wearing the newborn size.  They are thin and light weight, and my pick of all the newborn size onesies I currently own 
 One of my faves. Friedman was one of the best. Also read THE ROAD TO SERFDOM by F. A. Hayek.   As for Reviewer T.A. Turner: the good news is that your lobotomy IS reversible. There are a lot of brilliant ex-Marxists about these days. Reading Thomas Sowell for starters just may restore your mind. Of course, if it's your heart that's the problem....  Putting forth a man like V.I. Lenin who said:   "It would not matter if 3/4 of the human race perished; the important thing is that the remaining 1/4 be communist"   ---as an paragon of "compassion" is truly pathetic!   Yeah, the "compassionate" followers of Marx, Trotsky, Lenin, Mao & Pol Pot have thus far "liberated" by mass murder between 95 and 150 million souls. Purges, Pogroms and Killing Fields!  No other political party in human history has shed so much blood in the space of a single century. And Mr. Turner's colon is is knots over a Goldwater cartoon! Give me a break 
 Not quite up to the standard of his previous book on the famous directors he interviewed, it is nonetheless a charming complement and animated by the same quiet excitement.  Bogdanovich is a great film director--when he wants to be--but not quite a great writer, and I found that while I could read three or four of these personality profiles in a row, that was my limit before they all started to blur.  So it is a book to be savored not devoured.  It is produced on the patented Knopf film book model, everything luxe and overstuffed, with dozens of photo illustrations and an exquisute care about the presentation.  I always think these Knopf books are like a film buff's pornography, for it's all about the pleasure of sinking into them.  In this case, we get to glimpse close-up a handful of Hollywood's greatest stars, among them Cary Grant, James Stewart, and Henry Fonda.  Tighter close-ups involve Bogdanovich's own directing of Audrey Hepburn (sad story), River Phoenix (sad too) and Boris Karloff, the first star in any of Bogdanovich's movies.  This might have been sad, but Karloff emerges eerily in control of himself and his image.  The puzzling one is Sidney Poitier, and the story of his collaboration with PB  on "To Sir With Love Part II" is one of those head0scratching stories.  It might almost be fictional, a praody of Hollywood swallowing its own tail.  You can't believe they made a sequel to the original TO SIR WITH LOVE, and then that it came and went without a single trace, except this scrap of memoir, is startling proof that sometimes we truly do cast our pearls before swine.  Some buried Caesar indeed as Omar Khayham used to sing in his desert tents to the stars.  The chapter on John Wayne is perhaps the book's greatest success, and it is interview-based.  But he is not always the world's most incisive interviewer, and his conversation with Marlene Dietrich reveals nothing new, because apparently she did not want it to.  I did like the raw come-ons Ryan O'Neal, Bogdanovich's companion during the encounter with Dietrich, made to her.  "I dream about your legs and I wake up screaming," he leers.  Dietrich replies, "Me too. 
 Anna symbolizes the block that prevents Sandro and Claudia from confronting the lovelessness between them.  When Anna goes missing, Sandro and Claudia try to love each other but with troubled results. There is a grandeur to this film that I've found in no other. Antonioni's film language is startling.  The manner with which he reveals the psyches of his characters, especially through cinematography (his own brand of expressionism) has never ceased to amaze me.  The story seems simple enough, but the film landscape in which Antonioni places his characters reveals how complicated and agonizing love can be.  Buy it now 
 I'll be honest...I had to force myself to read those first few chapters.  It wasn't what I thought it was going to be, but then as I read on, the book turned to the story of the lead character's mother and that's what this book is really about.  You will be shocked at the hardships this mother went through in China and the daughter finally learns where she really comes from.  A good read after the first few chapters.  Read the whole book. 
 In a way I don't care because the one giant problem the US government has is massive debt.  That issue is tackled in the book "Empire of Debt" which is sold on Amazon.com.    However, I pretty much agree with everything written in this book.  But, I know most of the short comings with our courts and laws.  I was sitting in a law class and we were covering evidence and illegal interrogations.  This case dates back to the '60s.  A man did a kidnapping.  They knew the girl was murdered.  So, as the officers were driving the man to jail they said to one another "she deserves a good Christian burial rather than being eaten by magpies".  The suspect broke down and showed the body to the police.  The courts threw out the dead body as evidence.  The courts ruled that using guilt in getting a confession was cruel and unjustified.  So rather than letting this brutal murderer out of jail the state made an appeal.  The case was re-argued in front of the same court members.  In the exact same case the courts ruled that the finding of the body was legal for use as evidence because of the proof of a "methodic search".  The lawyer who was instructing us on this series of cases made a "pulling it out of their mouth" motion.  The chilling conclusion swept the room.  The law is anything the courts say it is.  We live in a judicial fiat.  This book is informative to the people who don't know much about Federal law.  However, it's a little dry to those of us who sat in evidence classes and seen the results of judicial fiat.  I always wonder why some grief filled parent does not take revenge on an elitist judge.   A good leftist lawyer could get them off.  
 We finally broke down and spent the money on the Jumperoo and were happy we did.  We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he'd jump for hours on end if we didn't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day.  The Jumperoo has sturdy construction, and the 4 settings are useful.  I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it, but he's been fine.  He doesn't play with the toy attachment.  I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame 
 Before this book, I never knew black people owned black slaves in USA.  Very enlightening 
 Villa's brilliant analysis of Chicano/a struggles over space and identity in the conquered Southwest shows us how studies of Mexican American culture can retain their political commitment in a post-ethical universe of  globalized consumerism and cynical academic celebrities. .His readings of  visual and written texts are a fascinating synthesis of aesthetic and  historical knowledges.  Que viva Barrio-Logos y Que viva nuestra raza de  bronce 
 Both Amazon and the book cover say this book is for ages 9-12, and that's the first mistake, in my opinion.  I can't imagine a child over 10 enjoying it.  Younger children, especially those whose parents will read it to them, are a more likely audience.  The surprises and scary moments aren't going to impress older kids.  That doesn't make it a bad book, it just makes it more appropriate for a younger group.  Serious, sensible Mary Rose kept pointing out gas stations to her father, but she was out-numbered.  Both her father and her younger sister, Jo-Beth, are the sort to leave things for the last minute.  That was how the girls ended up on the side of the road in a snowstorm, waiting for their father to return with a full gas can.  Jo-Beth suddenly realized that she simply had to get to a bathroom, too late to go with her father... and that was how the girls found themselves locked in a scary library in a blizzard overnight, with lifesized dolls that seem to watch them and a bird that talks.  When the power goes out and the moaning from the second floor begins, the fun's just getting started!    Help! I'm a Prisoner in the Library! is too cute to compete with the likes of Goosebumps for the older set, but the pre-Goosebump kids will enjoy this one, especially if Mom or Dad will read along with them on some not-too-dark winter's night 
 I grew up on Johnny Cash's music, and this CD held great memories!  It arrived in perfect condition as well.  No disappointments here.  
 Having never worked at a Starbucks or otherwise, I only knew that I liked boutique coffees more than Folgers, et al.. Trusting the products lines of the local gourmet Kitchen Store, I tried many of their machines on display, noting ease of use as well as the final product. In many cases it came down to the obvious, personal taste and the particular "roast" being used. Trying to spend my $4.00/day specialty coffee money on a machine that would appeal to design, ease of use, reputation, functionality and most of all the coffee it ultimately produced made the JURA/Swiss made extremely attractive. I realize nearly $2000 for a coffee machine seems a little crazy to many, but you do the math. The short list included the slightly more expensive S8 with the dual heating elements for shorter down time, but the touch control LED won out for me. No looking back, I've been extremely pleased with the F9 and the automated promps are a "no-brainer". 
 I like it a lot.  You should read it because it is insightful 
  I'm "glued" to this book...there's so much to learn - it truly teaches the    art of baking and explains things clearly. It also makes allowance for those of us who  use our KitchenAid mixer to knead the dough, as well as those who utilize a food processor. He covers all the bases. Only drawback are few pics. Otherwise, it's a great book 
 Sorry you never kept a scrapbook of the Jets 1968 championship season and Super Bowl III win on Jan. 12,1969?  No problem! This books reproduces the articles and photos of that magical season as chronicled by the NY Daily  News including many "backpages" of the original newspapers. A  must for every Jets fan, those who remember and those too young to have  been there

 as a longterm BS fanatic I like the greatest hits albums realy well, however my biggest disapointment still is the lack of concert DVD's from Bob Seger and the silver bullet band. Nowadays you can buy many concerts from rock legends of the 70ties and eighties, however not from one of the best Rockbands of the last 25 years.I surely hope that soon a live concert will be released on DVD so that fans all over the world, who had never had the occassion to see BS live can enjoy his performances. 
 Although this story churns slowly and with a writing style that many of us are not used to, it makes up for it with a great, chilling story that sticks with you after the last pages are over.  This is one of those books you have to read in the quiet to concentrate on each word, but it is all the quiet that can make this book scare you.  James' obviously did a masterful job on the story, with his cliffhanger ending, because to this day, people are still giving their interpretation of it and what it means.  And this story was published over 100 years ago, in 1898.  Any author would LOVE to have people still talking about a book like that, for better or worse.  I love the characters throughout this story, and you begin to wonder what exactly is going on - is she seeing ghosts?  Are the kids seeing ghosts?  Has she lost her mind?  All good questions and at the end, you still might be scratching your head, but it is still a satsifying conclusion that lets your creative mind decipher it all.  In conclusion, this book is a pretty slow read considering it's only like 100 pages, but once you get half way, you're not going to want to put it down 
 Well, I have had these cards for a while and I love them!I mean I have thought of 5 combos and have won duels with all of them. If your a fan of warriors I recommend you buy it. Plus all you have to do is add a few elemental heroes and you have a mini Jaden deck 
 This is the one that, no matter how many other books you've read about the Brontes, is the best ever. The writer of this book doesn't hoard her knowledge, but shares it in such a way that the reader will be amazed that so much information has never before been made available to us common-folk. This book allows the reader to interpret, rather than tangle through spider webs. 
 In taking a "Survey of Jewish History" course this fall, which is a broad subject, a broad and sweeping primary textbook was needed.  In the short space of 263 pages, Scheindlin covers equitably the history of world Jewry, balancing coverage of religious and sociopolitical elements.   Although accurately described as a secular book, Scheindlin is a practicing Jew and the book is certainly not irreligious.  In most cases (esp. premodern situations,) Scheindlin approaches an event or a conflict as a neutral observer, a historian documenting causes and effects.  Importantly, he explains the way Jewish societies around the world conceived of and reacted to their circumstances, without actually adopting their views in his writing.  This allows both Jew and non-Jew to feel comfortable with the book. Anyone who faults the book for its lack of detail misunderstands the point of the text and the feasability of what they are asking for.  What Scheindlin does with stunning success is give an interesting, accurate depiction, albeit with broad brushstrokes, of the forces that have shaped Jewry throughout the ages.   (I especially recommend the chapter on the Holocaust as riveting and awe-inspiring.  Scheindlin, in his understated tone, evokes the horror of "Shoah" (destruction) in a way that impresses even veteran readers with its vividness. 
 *What Americans Know About Politics and Why It Matters* is an important book in that it reveals how informed voters have more stable, consistent opinions and are much more resistant to irrelevant information (such as commentary in the media and campaign rhetoric, sound bites, and photo ops). It also reveals that informed voters hold opinions that more closely match those of the Founders of the United States -- including personal responsibility and limited federal powers -- than do those who are ignorant of the issues 
 I've read a few cycle books over the last couple years. I found it to be relaxed & a good read. The book was filled with some usefull information & answered a few questions concerning traveling on a bike 
 Listeners familiar with SMILE CD are aware that it's Brian Wilson's vindication as one of few genuine artists to emerge from popular music phenomenon called(BLUES had a baby and they named it...)Rock'n'Roll. After transcending Fun/Fun/Fun epoch of The Beach Boys(perhaps America's greatest touring group)Wilson's PET SOUNDS legend began.GOOD VIBRATIONS promised emergence of stellar American composer to match Copeland,Gershwin and Berstein.Then came relatively brief era (ars gratias guitarists)of flash guitar soloists[Hendrix;Clapton;Beck;Page;Santana;ending with Knopfler~Roger McGuinn--like Dylan--remains poet minstrel,no mere axeman.]where Wilson's work was dismissed as "kid stuff".Few musicians recognized Brian Wilson had transformed the recording studio into an INSTRUMENT of"infinite"possiblity;and had employed magnificent vocal and instrumental harmonic layering in radical fashion unappreciated and inimitable.(With writers like Van Dyke Parks he began constructing worthy lyric-literature.)Psychotic crash came.Drugs;intra-battles with Dad,Mike Love & Capital quenched the creative wick;Wilson seemed destined to remain Beach "Boy"para-gone.   Hints found in hymns like 'TIL I DIE brought a new legion of listeners and musicians(THE WONDERMINTS)to the rescue.The rest is  history.His wife Melinda and men like Darian Sahanaja and Jeffrey Foskett brought Brian & his music back to life culminating in SMILE. It's experience to challenge listeners and reward all but the most close minded. In this DVD video even the skeptical can enjoy a performance of popular music to rival classical works of by-gone masters transcending "THE CONCERT"show as art.You don't have to like it,but you MUST admire its verve and joyeous daring. Reviewers have discussed the DVD package;extras;and techinical quality.Unconvinced might recall observation by Dylan regarding Brian Wilson's deafness in one ear: "He should donate the good one to the SMITHSONIAN."SMILE~DVD is triumph of musicianship, techno-artistry and HEART.Amidst dreck commonly applauded(in lit. --cf:Da Vinci Code--music;film;painting)this "road-not-taken"of accessible,wondefully happy music is Ars Populi to make all but most jaded pseudos SMILE.          
 Rebecca Brown's THE GIFTS OF THE BODY really cast a spell on me, with its sober delicate style, and its no-nonsense but very humble approach.  It is incredibly hard to write about the emotions involved in taking care of people who are sick, but Brown does this by allowing her narrator to remain almost anonymous, and the only way she is revealed is through what she does for people, the simple yet startlingly intimate services she performs for people--from giving baths to cleaning kitchens to just being there to have a meal with them.  These acts of kindness, although performed by someone who is paid to be there, become glimpses of hope, just glimpses though, which makes them even more poignant that extravagant "heroic" narratives about "Saving Lives."  The narrator is not saving lives, as much as helping people to stay comfortable as the ravages of disease take them past comfort into a terrible region of pain.  The sentiments in this book are toned down almost to a purity of spirit:  there is deep feeling, but not of the variety most people are used to.  The depth comes from the frankness and business-like accuracy of the narrator, the way people come and go, the why finally she just has to quit for a while just to stay sane.    This book is amazing, and should be read by everyone, but especially by people who work with people who are disabled, sick, who need care 
 You know it kind of bothers me when folks label others. Especially when the label minimizes a person's worth.  Ask just about anyone to describe Richard Pryor and most likely you'll hear - he was a funny dude, a comedian.  While of course both are very true it's also an incomplete and unfair assessment of Richard Pryor because he was much more than that.    Along with being the quintessential stand up comedian, he was an incredibly talented writer, actor, cultural scribe and comedic visionary.  But, one of Mr. Pryor's most overlooked talents was that of Master Storyteller.    When Richard Pryor talked about events from childhood through adulthood or shared an observation it was more than just a bunch of funny anecdotes strung together. He carefully, skillfully recreated the moment, the mood, the scene and the context of that story.  You weren't just hearing a simple recollection of his experience; he actually took you there and was almost able to witness it firsthand.  Richard Pryor tells his stories by bringing together special elements and ingredients and expertly mixing all into an amazing experience.  You can say it's like watching a tapestry being made - all the parts big and small, no matter how inconsequential that they may appear to be individually, combined with a master's touch you have a fine work of art.  This 1979 release of Richard Pryor in Concert is a wonderful film that illustrates those talents and more.  Seeing this movie again made me realize how nice it was to have someone so talented as Richard Pryor to entertain us and make us laugh until we wet ourselves, but yet sad that he's gone and there will probably never be someone as talented or as remarkable again.  
 Diet books, articles and doctors are soooooo boring--not this one. Finally we get weight loss advice from someone nice to look at and listen to and --Eureka!--someone who cooks. Letha Hadady's book Feed Your Tiger and this Amazon Short "Feed Your Tiger: Lose Weight and Love It" have made a healthy diet and lifestyle both possible and entertaining. What a break for people of all ages whether or not they are overweight 
 Laura Ingalls Welder's biography is a great book. I recommend it for every body because it is a passionant story, she had lived a hard life and was courageous during it. This book is an example to show us that we can be happy without money. The third reason of my recommendation is that it is a relaxing book. You should read i 
 My mother bought a copy of this title for me to give to her future grandchild. I was so inspired by it, that I want to give it to all of my friends now. This book has delightful drawings and a wonderful message. This book is fun to read as an adult and a child. It is so important that children and adults are surrounded by positive messages like the one this book has to offer. I recommend it for everyone 
 The boots arrived packaged in their original packaging and individually wrapped inside.  These boots will never disappoint...they are fun, warm, comfy and stylish!  Dont forget to spray with silicon before taking them out 
 Bought the book for a class and have already given one copy as a gift and recommended the book to several others in leadership positions.  Great read for leaders in any type organization.  As a matter of fact, if you can motivate your people in a "for-profit" organization the way Drucker speaks of in this book, you can't help but be successful 
 Bethany Dillon has one of the BEST VOICES I have ever heard!  Her music grabs your heart, and doesn't let go.  What a truly AMAZING TALENT! 
  Catherine's book and her many articles that I've read have opened my world to web marketing, SEO, better customer relations and even helping grow my business by 45% this first year. I've even change my way of interacting with others in a new and refreshing way which I've been sharing with my staff, and associates.    I've been in the Ballroom Dance Business and Real Estate business for over 25 years and decided a few years ago that I was going to develope a web site and started doing my homework.   Through my research I found Catherine's book and since then I've read it many times.  Each time I go back to it, I find something new that I can add to my web site or a strategy that I can adopt for my web site marketing. There are only a few books I continually refer back to and this is at the top of the list!  Namaste, Matthew D'Ercole : 
 Earthquake Days: The 1906 San Francisco Earthquake & Fire in 3-D is an impressive photographic spectacle about the historic San Francisco Earthquake and is quite like no other treatment of the subject. The vintage black-and-white photographs have been treated so that they appear in 3-D with the aid of the accompanying viewer! The photographs are quite vivid to the naked eye as well, and the accompanying text by California-born historian David Burkhart recounts the historical debacle captured in the tragic images. In addition to the photographs of the city's devastation, Earthquake Days includes vintage newspaper clippings, sketches, cartoons, and the like concerning the disaster. A truly unforgettable visual presentation of a sad event in American history. 
 If you asked me whether I thought I could solve my baby's poor sleep habits without using the cry-it-out method, I would have said, "Impossible!" But I followed Dr Tobin's suggestions and within three nights my eleven month old was sleeping through the night. I wish I read this book when my baby was born! I've already bought this book for all of my friends 
 This is great table and chairs: solid, real and very good quality beech. My kids (3 and 7 years old) love it. I ordered "two days shipping" and I had my order two days later. I would recommend this product with my pleasure 
 All concepts of "Backless" are expressed in the "Brown" cover design. EC's vocal tone is kept "flat." All of the songs are "whispered" by EC who sits on the sofa under the lamp. My personal favorite EC's album is "No Reason To Cry" because I can listen to his best vocal performance. In "Backless", there aren't EC's some special performances but I never feel tired of listening to "Backless" though I have already listened over 100 times. This is magic of "Backless. 
 Rather, it is about obsession to destroy all that is meaningful.  The central character here is not the Jeremy Irons character, who is really more of a pawn, it is Juliete Binoche's Anna. Her embodiment of the role allows her unworldly, captivating presence to anchor the storyline; one does not even need to know how she was damaged to intuit it.  The other main character here is Binoche's dead brother; the origin of the sibling's destructive relationship is displayed through the character of Binoche's mother, Leslie Caron, who gives a brilliant performance appearing addled and unaware, yet anything but...she is the original damaged goods in this film  There are so many layers driving the finality. Louis Malle's direction leaves every subtlety before the audience. This is an example of the best art has to offer 
 For those of you waiting to see Pan's Labyrinth, this film serves as an excellent introduction to  Mexican director Guillermo del Toro. There are a number of common themes including horror, youth, civil war, the supernatural, etc. Not particularly horrific, but suspenseful and entertaining.  
 It's easy to fall in love.  However, it's definitely not easy to stay in love while we want to be ourselves.    My significant other and I have been together for a little only over 2 years, but we've been having trememdous trouble communicating, which has been a major cause for our constant arguements and conflict during the course of our relationship.  I ordered probably almost five "relationship/communication" books on Amazon.com in hope of solving our problems.  With the four out of the five books, I probably only read through the very beginning of it.  With this book, as I started reading this one which seemed pretty short in lenghth, I wasn't too hopeful either.  All I was interested in was "finish the book and don't waste the money."  As I finished Chapter One, I was totally hooked.  I proceeded to the next and next chapter and couldn't stop.  I found out so many answers to the source of our arguement only from the first 20 pages.  When my significant other came home the same night, I did a little experiment that I learned from the book so far with him who was already exhuasted from working late and feeling cranky.  Surprisingly, it really worked.  Not only did we express our negative feelings to each other but also gained understanding for each other.  I was so excited and surprised!  All of a sudden, I realized the major reason to our misunderstanding and resentment towards each other.  This book is fantastic!  The author who is a psychologist talks a lot about his experiences with his clients and his past and current girlfriends.  It shows that he truly understands the difficulty to cope with the problems in a relationship as a normal human beings like the rest of us, which is really important and also what makes his viewpoint convincing and powerful.  In other words, he can relate to us.  I highly recommend this book to those who are in the same situation like I do with my significant other 
 Cute Christmas board book with squeaky Rudolph.  My 20-month-old son couldn't make the Rudolph squeak on his own though.  But he did like the sound when I would do it 
 The Green Mile is the first Stephen King work I have read and like an illicit drug I'm hooked on the first hit. I'd heard King was a good novelist before but I was faced a serious dilemna over the fact that I would've acquired insomnia if I had read any of his more morbid tales. Still filled with the supernatural but not so much the macabre elements of Stephen King, The Green Mile was my compromise and an excellent compromise at that.  Mainly set in 1932 at Cold Mountain penitentiary's death row the story is about a man who is sentenced to death for the rape and murder of two young girls. But as the head prison guard, Paul Edgecombe, soon finds out his newest prisoner is much more than a six foot eight black convict who can hardly string together a sentence. So much more that Edgecombe is soon convinced that John Coffey (like the drink, only not spelled the same way) is innocent of the horrible crime he is accused of commiting.  King spins his tragic tale with vivid imagery, powerful metaphors and suspenseful foreshadowing provoking not only sadness but also equally strong feelings of anger. He builds the tension gradually and this may turn off some readers but this same technique heightens the enjoyment of the action near the end of the story.    Ultimatley, The Green Mile while slow paced, is a heart rending story of an amazing man with an even more amazing gift and will always be a timeless literature classic 
 A much better read the The Last of the Mohicans, this book is actually presented in understandable language.  And while trivial at times, this novel presents a clear and interesting picture of 17th Century colonial life and is an enjoyable read 
 "Crossfire",a film noir, from 1947, deals with the subject of HATE,specifically anti-semitism in a powerful way.A Jew,Sam Levine,is killed and Insp.Finley,played by Robert Young, investagates and concludes that a just discharged GI is the culprit.But which one,Robert Mitchum,Steve Brodie,or Robert Ryan,or perhaps one played by one of lesser known actors?The acting,screenplay,direction,and photography is fine,but the subject matter HATE is most MOST relevant item.America is at a crossroad,in its history,and I'm afraid its leaning in the WRONG direction.Gloria Graham,Jacqueline White, and Paul Kelly also appear.Even better than the film,is the commetary by noir experts Alain Silver and James Ursini with audio inserts by director Edward Dmytryk,of Hollywood Ten fame.The three do an excellant job in describing the political climite of the times.There certainly wasn't any lack of political conservatives,in hollywood back them,or a lack of informers either.Both director Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott(also Hollywood 10) went to prison,for contempt of Congress,refusing to answer HCUA questions perting to alleged Communists in the film industry.Dmytryk,after his jail term named names.Also included on the DVD is a featurette "HATE IS LIKE A LOADED GUN".The film rates 4-stars.The extras rate 5-stars.Maybe its bcause I'm a political leftist that I love noir 
 She gives us thru this particular masterpice a good idea how the clasic music has to be play 
 I listened to the Unabridged Audio version of "47", narrated by the late, great Ossie Davis. It was a wonderful experience.  The story although aimed toward young teen audiences, is not too simple for adults to enjoy.  This story is a heartfelt introduction to slavery for today's youth (to whom many this history is forgotten.)  Kudos to Mr. Mosley for taking on such a tough subject; and for the foresight to aim it to a young audience.  On another note, Ossie Davis did an outstanding job with the narrative; I will always treasure this as one of his great works of art.  -- P. Walker-Williams, PageTurner.net 
 See my notes on volume 1. The enthusiasm continues unabate 
 Overall it's a good product except for two things:  1. the USB is way too short, a little bit over 1 foot. LaCie, what are      you talking about? it probably costs you only one dollar to add some      extra length. The whole point of an external hard drive is its     portability and a short cable doesn't give you that. 2. USB interface, dc power, and power switch are put all one side, but   the LED indicator is on the other side. Again, dear designers, have     you ever tried to work with your own stupid design? Do you know how    awkward that is? 
 Hartshorne is by far the most clear and compact of all introductions to algebraic geometry. I agree with what most of the other reviewers have said about the book. It is absolutely amazing how the Grothendieck et al. approach has provided us with tools that we almost take for granted, whereby everything seems precise and crystal clear. AG has definitely made a profound influence on our philosophy of mathematics.  Lee Carlson is absolutely right about exploring the literature for geometrical motivation and different perspectives. Throughout his book, Hartshorne does not reference enough to the Italian and Weil literature (NB these were definitely not the only early protagonists!). (However, he does inform his reader about this in the intro.).  Here are some classics for different homological perspectives (which as he mentions are essential for the budding algebraic geometer to read)   Godement-Topologie Algebrique et Theorie des Faiscieux  (???) Serre- Faisceux Algebrique Coherents (Oeuvres I) Grothendieck's Tohoku paper    All of them are definitely still worth reading and are probably the best introductions to sheaves and categories. In fact, at the moment I'm reading Serre's FAC and am having a wonderful time. If you don't know French, then learn it! The French is very easy and all a non-french speaker will probably need is a small dictionary.   It is my opinion that one should should explore the literature as soon as possible and not get bogged down by the countless no. of other introductions. Algebraic geometry is a huge and central subject that one cannot afford to waste time with the basics.  To find other modern classics, I think Hartshorne's reference is superb. If you really want go back in time (but not too back), then check out in particular Jacobi's CW and Baker's Abelian Functions : Abel's Theorem and the Allied Theory of Theta Functions (Cambridge Mathematical Library). (Obviously the litarature abounds in both directions of the 19th Century)   A great overview and reference to the 20th Century history of algebraic geometry is Dieudonne's little book `History of Algebraic Geometry' (worth the rediculus pricing). In particular, Serre's philosophy in introducing cohomology is discussed in the book, which I found very interesting.  Great further reads are (leaving the arithmetic story [e.g. Elliptic Curves] aside) :  SGA, EGA (in french too!)  The 1974 AMS Arcata, which shows a lot of the directions AG is heading.   Lang or Mumford- Abelian Varieties (both are great.  Mumford uses schemes, but Lang touches arithmetic).  Milne- Etale Cohomology.  This is a very good text that will lead the reader to Deligne's Conjecture de Weil I & II.  Serre- Algebraic Groups and Class Fields.  Contains different approaches to the Riemann-Roch Thm and discusses goemetric class field theory.  Griffiths and Harris.  This gives a different approach to algebraic geometry. It's more geometric and touches upon many concepts that originated from (introduced by) de Rham and E. Cartan (e.g. Currents, differential forms etc.)  Mumford- Lectures on algebraic surfaces. Shafarevitch et al.- Algebraic surfaces. These are special topics and the books are 'raw' in the sense that they are 'straight from the horses' mouths'.   (...)  The reader should also be aware of the new and surprising relationaships AG is having with the world (lee carlson's review gives an idea) and number theory. In addition, one of the two 2002 Fields medalists (V. Veovodsky) got this recognition for his deep and insightful interplay between Algebriac Geometry (motives) and Algebraic topology (homotopy, K-theory).    Hartshorne's exercises are extremely instructive to the point of absolutely crucial because of the scarcity of examples in the book.   For those self-studying, a Google search will probably provide one with solutions to some of the exercises in the chapters 
 If you want to listen to the best of Pulp (in my honest opinion) then this would be it.  The music is stunning, unlike anything you've ever heard before, and jarvis' voice is so SEXY.  The lyrics are outstanding and the music itself evokes good feelings.  You will not regret buying this album..  I recommend you all listen to "Lipgloss" "Babies" "Do you remember the first time" and "David's last summer".  You will love it 
 Great book for any one looking for the basics or a bit more. Well put together, though I could have appreciate more illustrations of drums mentioned 
 If you take a look at Rage's rating for all four studio albums by customers on Amazon.com, they're all 4 and 1/2 star rated. That was how good this band was. Although this page is for Renegades, I just want to comment on Rage's music on the whole. Doesn't it seem that most rock groups nowadays sing about relationships, heartbreaks and the likes? And every rock group vocalist seems to have that high pitched-punk rock voice? Well, Rage Against The Machine was different. They had things to say, they projected their views through their songs. They were one of the most powerful and influential voices on many many political agendas. And hey, even if you don't agree with what they have to say, you still have to appreciate these guys on a musical level. I have all 4 studio albums and listen to them very often until today. In fact, I'm listening to Renegades right now. No other group has longetivity like this band.   Everyone in Rage knows what to do, and how to do it. When they create music, it's not planned...it just IS. Zack de la Rocha is the ever energetic vocalist, he definitely puts the Rage in RATM. I believe that his voice was the perfect one to go with the group, although I do respect Chris Cornell and think he's a talented vocalist as well but it was de la Rocha which harnesses the power and the momentum. Tom Morello is one of THE most gifted guys around when it comes to playing the guitar. His creativity in creating sounds I never knew a guitar could create, astounds me everytime I listen to their albums. The squeaks and bleeps from him sound like something a DJ with a turntable would do. Bassist Timmy C complements Tom's sounds to create something even better. And Brad Wilk is exceptional on drums. Watching them live is the ultimate experience, especially their open air shows. It is definitely a wild and thrilling ride.  To conclude, I just want to say that if you're reading this and still contemplating whether to fork out your cash to get this or any other Rage album...please do. To be honest, at first I just downloaded their albums but they were so good i bought all 4 albums. They are well worth it and you'll find yourself not just casual listeners to Rage, but a hardcore fan of theirs 
 Reviewed by Irene Watson for Reader Views (9/06)  There are many books as well as theories on high blood sugar and diabetes; however, I have yet to find one that gives as detailed and concise information as "The Sugar Solution."  Even though full of information, this book is very reader friendly, not using medical terms that a layperson cannot understand.  It was a real pleasure for me to find all the needed information in one book.  I have insulin resistance and thought I understood much of what was going on.  Not.  After reading "The Sugar Solution" I feel so much more informed than what my doctor was able to relay to me.  Insulin resistance is a precursor to Type II Diabetes and unless looked after it will create health issues.  The editors detail the importance of creating a balance within the body and give easy to follow examples of food intake to maintain sugar balance as well as maintain desirable weight.  Overweight issues often accompany insulin resistance.  Blood sugar problems can cause other major illnesses within the body besides diabetes.  The editors cover metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, pregnancy diabetes, as well as childhood diabetes.    The editors of "The Sugar Solution" detail weight-loss strategies, making healthy choices when eating out at restaurants, indulging in sweets and adding supplements to the eating plan.  Of course, as with any maintenance plan exercise is of utmost importance. The editors present a 10 minute a day strength training regime that anyone can endure.  They even present a 28-day lifestyle makeover that is easy to follow.  Better yet, they even add over 60 recipes that are interesting, easy to make, and of course healthy.  "The Sugar Solution" is a book to keep as a reference and a book to read for information.  Most people don't realize they consume 5 pounds of sugar within a month, sweeteners have more than 50 names, and, half of Americans have insulin resistance.  Reading this book the reader will not only learn how to prevent onset of diabetes, but will learn how to effectively maintain a balanced body if already diagnosed with a blood sugar related syndrome 
 As the title says, this is a very complete book about woodworking. In it, they tell you about wood, how to design projects, the different tools and how to use them, and finishes. The second part of the book shows 40 projects with step by step instructions on how to put build them. And the color photographs and drawings are beautiful and show a lot of detail. If you're only going to buy one book about woodworking, this is the book you should get. What more can you ask for in a woodworking book 
 I feel that CM really excelled in this second book of the trilogy. While I thought that "Pretty Horses" was quite wonderful, "The Crossing" really works its way into one's mind and soul. Character development, scene description, dalogue are superb. One of the best books I have read 
 I taught myself to knit from books when I was a teenager. Now that I'm in my 50s I've knitted for many years, but still didn't know some of the common "tricks of the trade" I might have learned if I had been taught by an old pro or if I had taken classes. This book fills in the gaps and gives me lots of ideas about how to work around problems. It also increased my understanding of some technical details of knitting that I would never have figured out on my own. Easy to read, well organized, and a useful reference book to keep on hand 
 I have always considered myself a bit of an audiophile.  I appreciate and enjoy quality sound reproduction in both my music and in my movies.  The Bose Companion 5 sound system delivers sound quality well beyond my high expectations for sound.  The price tag is pretty steep, but I decided to go for the surround sound capabilities offered in the Companion 5 system to augment my 30" Apple Cinema Display for an immersive movie-going experience on my Mac.  If connected and set up as per the instructions, this sound system delivers the performance as advertised.  Connection is by a simple USB plug.  After that, a quick trip to System Preferences in OS X requires a few set up changes in the sound panel and that is all there is to it.  The first time I played music from iTunes I opened my equalizer and adjusted the settings to my preferences as well as the bass settings knob on the acoustimass sub woofer.  I have owned several sets of speakers including Klipsch and I can easily attest that the Bose Companion 5 is superior to all of them.  The first movie I tried out was "Saving Private Ryan".  From the DVD options menu I selected Dolby 5.1 audio and then I cranked up the volume and watched the Normandy invasion scene.  It was simply incredible.  Several times I was turning and looking behind me because I thought my dog was knocking something over in the room; only to realize that it was the sound of bullets ricocheting behind me.  Awesome.  Of all the Bose products I have owned, I have found them all to deliver superior sound as advertised.  If you can get past the sticker shock on these speakers, and make sure that you've adjusted the sound settings on your computer as well as the equalizer settings in your computer's music player and the bass settings knob on the back of the acoustimass sub woofer, I can pretty much guarantee you're going to be in for a very impressive audio experience whether it is music or movies 
 Even a few years after it's release, Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" still sends a strong message to the reader and exposes the fast food industry for what it really is... a group of very large and very powerful marketing companies... not a purveyor of good food--or nutritious food for that matter.   For many years, food additives and techniques have been the dirty little secret of the industry, but not these things are starting to surface.  The book takes you through the processing warehouses and chemical plants that the industry uses to "make" the foods served at these restaurants.  It opens your eyes to practices done to cut costs and sacrifice your health in the process.  I've recommended this book to many of my clients and many are reluctant to read it at all, probably because of the emotional attachment they have to their favorite fast food.  Since this book came out, there are so many more studies and reports on what is in the fast foods then there ever were before.  Reports including additives, trans-fats and other inflammation causing ingredients are helping the industry clean up it's act.  This doesn't mean that fast food is good for you, it just means that Schlosser has done an excellent job at bringing attention to an industry that wasn't challenged as strongly as it should have been.  I personally haven't had fast food for over 5 years, but--even that far removed--as I was reading this I felt sick to my stomach.  Read this book and you'll never step foot in McDonalds again.

  "Brian I got you something."        "What is it?"     "It's a hatchet."   "Oh thanks" All those people who love survival and wilderness books you should try reading Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. Hatchet is about a boy whose mom and dad just suffered a divorce. Brian flies to his dads for the summer. The pilot suffers a heart attack. He loses control of the wheel and Brian of course  tries to fly the plane but he  knows  that he needs to crash it so he crashes it into the lake.  While he's  trying  to survive he might just have to use that hatchet. If you love survival and wilderness books I would be sure to read this one. I gave this book 5 stars because I think the main characters and the setting are so real . So I recommend this book for everyone! 
 Oh boy, This Doctor is no Sh-t. This doctor knows how to play his Hammond-bro, and sure knows how to build up a solo too. Buikding up a solo? He is Jimihendrixing his organ.

This is jazz music straight from the heart, and even your mother will confess: our Doctor speaks an international tongue of jazz and soul music staight from the heart.  Enjoy 
 Having worked for many years in the navy, reading books has occupied a great deal of my time.  The first occasion on which I read the book tattoo, I was struck by the sheer depth to the charachters that enabled these american individuals in an alien culture to my own, to be brought to life and appreciated by myself, an english sailor.  I have read the book many times since and will continue to do so in the future.  Along with Orwell's 1984, it is my favourite 
 In a chapter titled "A Child's Anger", they mentioned this as "the most difficult part of parenting" And it is. It would have been nice if they have expand a bit than what was written. Instead, the chapter becomes an advertisement for the book they've previously write. I don't mind advertisement, but when presented this way, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth 
 Art Williams started out as a high school football coach, earning $10,700 a year.  But he didn't stay there for long. He believed in himself enough to take a chance and be a winner.   That chance has paid off amazingly. Today, A L Williams is a billionaire.   In 2005 Forbes magazine ranked him #413 on the list of The World's Richest People with a net worth estimated at $1.6 billion (He is richer than Oprah Winfrey). So, if you want to really know what it takes to become a winner then.....reading this book should be enough 
 This book was utterly full of suprises.  Man, how one little fish has altered and played a role in so much political and economic attitudes towards the sea and its treasures.  The book also stands as a cautionary tale of what can happen when a natural resource such as cod are recklessly exploited to the point of having the inability to recover their numbers.  As a marine biology teacher I was faascinated with this book and plan on having my classes read it to see how the ocean world affects life on land 
 I agree with the idea of fighting cancer with nutrition. However, I would like to note that the cancer-fighting nutrient most proven to date is selenium. A daily supplement of 200 microgram of selenium, has been shown in a large placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study -- the most prestigious type of scientific study of nutrients and drugs -- to cut the death rate from cancer in half.  Specifically, a large group of people who were given each day a yeast tablet enriched with 200 micrograms (mcg) of selenium had only half the number of deaths from cancer over a seven year period as a similarly large control group who were given a daily yeast tablet containing no selenium. Yeast tablets enriched with 200 mcg of selenium are readily available at pharmacies as well as health stores across the U.S. for about $5 or so for a bottle of 50 to 100 tablets -- only 10 cents or less per day -- I do.  The results of this dramatic study were published in the medical profession's own journal: The Journal of the American Medical Association. Nevertheless, most doctors pay no attention to the results. Think about that, selenium (at 10 cents per day or less) has been shown in a large clinical study to cut the death rate from cancer in half and nobody tells the public about it. Incredible! In my opinion, as a research chemist, everybody in the U.S. should take supplemental selenium every day.  Other good cancer fighters include vitamin C, vitamin E, CoQ10, and lycopene 
 Hearn, Lian. Grass for His Pillow. Penguin Group: New York, 2003 Borders Books $13 Realistic Fiction     A continuation of the story started in Across the Nightingale Floor, the second book in the Otori series, Grass for His Pillow, follows the journeys of Kaede and Takeo after they are separated to fulfill their destinies.  Themes of love and tragedy work together to make this book dynamic and interesting.  Recommended age 16 and up for violence and some sexual content.     This book is a great read.  The story is told from two different viewpoints, conveying the story in two different situations.  Sometimes the viewpoints overlap as Kaede and Takeo interact with each other, making the story more rounded and complete.  Hearn's thorough research of feudal Japan has made this book historically realistic, and the incorporation of super human powers adds that fictional side to the story which makes it engaging to read.  The use of fictional elements allowed me to imagine stealthfully sneaking past guards and tricking people into believing something that never happened.  The deceitful nature of the characters pulled me into the novel as there are things I knew that other characters didn't.  This created dramatic irony as one of the viewpoints would know the truth of certain events and tell the other viewpoints something else, yet I as the reader knew the whole story!  The dynamics of the characters as well as the valid portrayal of feudal Japan made this story very intriguing and I would recommend this book to those who love history and adventure novels. 
 What a find it was to buy a used copy of this book in India. I purchased it at a little book store in the mountains - well out away from all the big cities. I was kind of amazed that it was there on the shelf for sale. I spent almost two months on my own "spritual Journey" around India and traveled over 6,500 miles.   What Sara writes about and feels is kind of what all first timers to India find or must think. The longer you are there the more you begin to absorb the culture and understand the people. It is a cultrual shock no matter how much you think you are open to yoga, Hindu religious beliefs and the people. There is just something so special and different there that you find in person. The author captures much of that energy in her book.   I would recommend that anyone going to India buy this book and read it on the flight over there (You will have lots of time to read many books on the airplanes - that is one very long flight! 
 As the owner of Toni Roman's LearningSpanishVideoReviews web site, I am more than happy to have this opportunity to post my reivew of this wonderful resource for learning Spanish.  I am guilty of "borrowing" a method of learning Spanish from another Amazon reviewer. Although I have just started his or her method, I am finding it very fun. And if I am finding it fun, in the long run it'll prove to be effective because if I'm finding it fun to learn, I will stay motivated enough to keep studying and practising, and that's how we all learn by studying and practising. In any case, Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Verb Tenses has been a very important part of this method. I call it my five-step action plan but here's the method:   1.) Vocabulary Builder: Everyday read either  1001 Most Useful Spanish Words or Easy Spanish Phrase Book. These books will  help you increase your vocabulary. They are also easy to read and very cheap. Both books are also very small so I always keep one or the other in my purse.   2.) The Foundation: You can use any of the popular comprehensive courses to serve as your foundation. Like the other Amazon reviewer, I chose Learning Spanish Like Crazy for this since I found that the Spanish in LSLC is closer to the Spanish that you'll hear Latin Americans speak. I also found that LSLC uses a method that will have you learning Spanish quicker than other courses and developing an accent that is almost like that of a native speaker. LSLC is kind of  expensive but it is worth the price.   3.) Reinforcement: The third step I also learned from the other Amazon reviewer. And  this may be the most important step in the process.  Whenever I am driving I'll have a CD in my CD changer from Learn in You Car Spanish and I'll also have a different CD in the CD changer from Mark Frobose's Behind the Wheel Spanish. That way anytime that I am driving I'm listening to a different teaching methods and hearing different Spanish speakers. Sometimes I'll also alternate with one of the Learning Spanish Like Crazy CDs because that's also a learn-in-your-car course.   4.) Implementation: Of course, you'll still have to practice what you learn with native Spanish speakers.   5.) Grammatical Reference: The first four steps are not my own "invention." The first four steps I picked up from another Amazon reviewer. But I noticed that her method lacked something very important: A reference or guide book for Spanish grammar.  That's where the Spanish Verb Tenses and Spanish Pronouns and Prepositions come in. Both books are very helpful and full of exercises that cover all of the important aspects of Spanish grammar. In the alternative, you can also use The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice to learn the Spanish grammar component. 
 In Vol. 2 we get more of the same from Yoko Kanno which is a good thing. 17 tracks from Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex, 2nd Gig.  Among those tracks are extended versions of Get 9 and Rise, which really gets the heart pumping and the spirit moving.  Any fan of Yoko Kanno or any fan of Ghost In The Shell or any fan of anime in general needs to grab this CD, new or used 
 I see a lot of critics of the Ornish diet suggested in the book; however, it certainly seems as if there is a lot of data available to document the results and support the promotion of the Ornish diet.  However, I would strongly suggest reading both Dr. Dean Ornish's book on reversing heart disease and Dr. Julian Whitaker's book on the same.  I think that the Whitaker book provides a much more practical view and also displays what may be a good diet (and life-style, etc) for (1) a healthy person that wants to prevent possibility of heart disease, a "preventative" approach, and (2) a person who has heart disease and needs a "reversal" approach.  That said, Dr. Ornish's book is an eye-opener and does cause a concerned reader to focus on the level of discipline and focus that a "reversal" diet and life-style requires 
 George Breahm has written a very concise book on the fiction and folklore that encompasses Harry Potter. This book does not  cover any new aspects of the HBP Book 6, but Breahm gives a very easy-to-read and detailed review of the first 5 books in the series.   For even more INSIGHTS, CLUES and MYSTERIES, I also recommend to serious HP fans to read the newly released ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence as it is a great guide to the HBP Book 6, Movie 4 and the new mysteries leading into Book 7. Authors Breahm and Lawrence are to be applauded for their works.   
 I had to read this book for a Media Ethics class and I must say that it was one of my favourite books!  Salant teaches readers about the workings of a newsroom and the struggle to do what is right with the news through funny annecdotes and interesting stories.  Any aspiring journalist MUST read this, and anyone just looking for a good biography would do well to read this.  (Actually, EVERYONE should read this as journalism and the media are a strong presence in all our lives, and this is a fun way to learn more about it. 
 This is my favorite film, bar none.  MPI Home Video is releasing this title on DVD 5/15/07, according to MPI's official site.  In addition, as of this writing (Feb 07), this stellar film is showing in theatrical re-release in as many as 30 American cities.  This film has everything an epic should have: a first-rate cast, beautifully-written screenplay, spectacular (and mostly historically accurate) settings, even solid humor.  I've been waiting for this to be released on DVD for years 
 Ancient pagan and modern Christian symbolism, by Dr. Thomas Inman (1869)  Dr. Inman has provided us a classic on the history of fertility cults and the Christian adaptation of its symbolism. This book is well illustrated, and while there are a few points I don't agree with, and a few points he overlooked, I'd say that after 137 years, this book is still at least 85 to 90% accurate - which is better than most books written during any period.   Inman bases many of his ideas on Richard Payne Knight and Godfrey Higgins, both of whom contributed excellent research that is still pertinent for any student of mythology and theology today. Other researchers that came after Inman that I also recommend to the reader for deeper understanding, are: Clifford Howard, B.Z. Goldberg, Sir. James George Frazer, Hargrave Jennings, Wilhelm Reich, Bronislaw Malinowski, James DeMeo, etc. Especially important to consider with this work, as well as the other above mentioned authors, is the complete support for John Allegro's contentions of Christianity being based on fertility worship as he argued in his 1970 publication - The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross - to which he received universal condemnation.   A few of minor problems with this book: Inman actually believed that the pagan fertility symbolism "adapted" into Christianity was foreign to Christianity, instead of part of it's original foundation pre-council of Nicea. From my years of study, I find this idea completely baseless (though I know many will disagree). As well, Inman is of the time when anything associated with human sexuality is considered "primitive," "dirty," "gross," "disgusting," "uncivilized," etc., rather than being the beautiful cause of creation that we are all here in existence because of. This is something the "heathen worshippers" whom he wrote about clearly understood, that he couldn't grasp himself, or at least made himself appear so as to remain politically correct. His repulsion to human sexuality, his inability (even as a medical doctor) to illustrate, or discuss in full, the human anatomy, even in pencil drawn illustrations, becomes frustrating. He censors the book in many places, saying that to show the human anatomy is just to uncivilized. To discuss it further, well, that would degrade what it means to be civilized. Finally, Inman, like B.Z. Goldberg, believed that sex was the only origin of religion. The topics of archaeoastronomy and intoxicating substances are only discussed briefly, when in fact they are as much the (interrelated) foundation of religion and mythology as fertility worship.   Regardless of these flaws in Inman's work, the book is a 5 star production and an absolute necessity for any student of the ancient mysteries, theology, mythology and archaeology. BUY IT!  
 I bought this movie on the basis that I am an Artie fan, and I have no regrets.  This movie turned out to be really funny, but only if you like Artie's sense of humor 
 This biography is a psychologically compelling, fascinating portrait of Anne Sexton the person.  I wouldn't call it a relaxing read, but if you are interested in Anne Sexton or in a rather mysterious mental illness this is for you.  I've been telling many friends about this book 
 (This review is for the Criterion Collection release of this dvd -- not for the Image Entertainment release that many other reviews here refer to.)    "Bicycle Thieves" (as it is wisely retranslated from the Italian for this new Criterion release) is one of the few "perfect films" -- by which I mean a film that is in its own way just as it should be, lacking nothing, the kind of film where even apparent missteps tend to contribute indelibly to the overall impression of a film in which nothing could have been changed without damaging the film.  Take, for example, the scenario that instead of an unknown day laborer in the role of Antonio, de Sica had gone with David Selznick's suggestion of Cary Grant (which was a condition for the film getting funded through American studios).  I have no doubt that this would have remained an interesting film, and that Grant would have done an admirable job -- but it would have been a totally different film and would have lost the fragility and vulnerability and delicacy (combined with hardness and objectivity) that make this film so precious.  We can all be grateful that De Sica chose to wait for an Italian investor who allowed him to make the film the way he and Zappatini had planned.  Without giving away anything of the plot, I will say that the conclusion of the film is one of the most powerful I have seen -- and carries an emotional weight that is earned rather than manipulated, and that can be compared only to a very few films: Chaplin's City Lights and Kiarostami's Close-up are the only films that come to mind.  De Sica strikes a very delicate balance between realistic depiction of the harsh realities of life in postwar Rome, and a humanistic vison of the resourcefulness of individuals in the face of hopelessness and the enduring power of empathy, forgiveness, and love.    The film looks better than ever on this new Criterion edition -- it seemed to me that a few shots were a bit washed out but I can only assume that is due to the condition of the available negatives.  Spots and dust and other imperfections seem to have been removed entirely, and the subtitles are quite good and easy to read.  The film alone would make this set an essential one, but the booklet (containing some excellent essays, including a very illuminating essay by Andre Bazin) and attached documentaries (one on neorealsm, one on screenwriter Zappatini, and one on De Sica) make this set as a whole like a master course on one of the undisputed masterpieces of cinema.  
 This book is a masterpiece, transporting the reader back into the momentous and tragic years of the 1930's.  It catalogs the different currents of events in Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Japan, the United States, Britain and France, packed with revealing details, anecdotes and biographical sketches of the key personalities.  Of the dozens of books I've read on the period, this is clearly the best.  Although long, it is easy to read and hard to put down; I expect to read it again 
 I'm amazed to be the first one reviewing this exceptional work. It has considerably clarified my views on militarism-pacifism and power relations between individual and group. Not only the author's ability to synthesise knolwedge of diverse fields (politics & national security, culture & history, psychology, religion...) but his lucid thinking and fluent use of language really bring matters home. Sometimes I asked myself whether "Out of Weakness..." is a professional academic account of extremely complex and controversial issues or a poetic parable much to the like of Indian chieftains' famous orations. Obviously it is both - something that one does not come across very often - as it reflects the synchronization of head and heart (thinking and feeling) in it's best. The latter in a sense being the subject matter of the whole book - how anxiety and rage is produced and regulated in (inter)societal context, how it is supressed and what are the compensatory mechanisms of this supression (narcissism and paranoia); and how the latter bring about and breed on war. And last but not least, how this self-perpetuating situation might be overcome 
 This is a big dumb action thriller, and I mean that in the best possible way.  Sure, it's not Die Hard... However I don't think it's fair to compare every Bruce Willis movie to one of the greatest action movies ever made.  It has more than it's fair share of excitement and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep me occupied.  The opening car chase is top notch.  There are quite a few excellent character actors who turn in great performances here... Look for Tom Sizemore, Robert Pastorelli, Andre Braugher, and Timothy Busfield (as well as his spindly little girl legs).  It's not going to change the world.  It's not going to make you forget Die Hard.  It's a fun thriller... especially with a couple friends, some popcorn, and a few beers.  Worth a rental!  
 The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is not spiral bound, which would make it much easier to use. Otherwise, it's an excellent learning aid, especially the CD that comes with it. The songs included are easy enough for a beginner, but the CD demonstrates what can be done with the same song when you get to be a better player. Plus, you can hear what they're supposed to sound like, instead of just reading the music. The music is in Nakai tab, so it's quite easy to learn and use. Highly recommended 
 This is a book that could serve as a wake-up call.  ... .  Warner grounds his arguments in contemporary politics and offers an intervention worth reading. Even if he doesn't change your views, you will look a little more carefully at fund-raising mail from mainstream gay organizations.  It would be nice to see this analysis extended to other issues, but the marriage debate serves as a boiler plate for other arguments 
 I am actually quite surprised at the vitriolic criticism directed at this book in a lot of the reviews I have read, but what I have noticed is that it has come from mainly those of Indian descent which I actually find quite amusing, oh and before anyone even goes down the road of saying "what do I know about India and Indian traditions?" I am actually half Indian, have been to India on many occasions and not just for holidays so my right to be quite amused is a genetic God given right in my opinion!  I actually liked this book a lot, it was warm, frothy, gentle, sweet, well written, and at times quite funny it also in many ways hit home in some of its observations, because I have met families like Anju's, in fact I have a family on my father's side like Anju's!  Whilst reading this book, which I did in one sitting, I enjoyed it that much I was quite surprised at how much it mirrored some of my life and that of close Indian friends living here in the UK and even in India!  The plot is simple enough, Anju is unmarried at 30 and heading for spinsterhood, her wealthy parents love their daughter but they desperately want her to get married, her mother's flippant comment about "I don't want you to be happy, I want you to be married" is actually quite funny, well it made me laugh, my father pretty much said the same to me and like Anju I felt frustrated, annoyed, and exasperated but in the end our families only want what they think is best for us, and Anju sees and even understand this, she does her best to comply with their hopeful wishes to find a husband but oh my God look what she has to put up with in the way of potential suitors!  By escaping to New York to study Anju manages to hold back the tide of unsuitable suitors but she too wants the dream of a nice marriage, she sees her best friend's supposed perfect marriage through less than rose tinted glasses, she pretty much see most people's short comings but it she who is pitied by those watching her because she is not married.  This is a fairy tale with a spice filled difference, and the scene describing how Anju bribes the Astrologist to tell her parents that she will find a husband but not necessarily in India is absolutely hysterical, I almost fell out of my wheelchair laughing, not to mention a truly poignant moment when Anju realises that one of the guys she actually likes is in love with an English girl who is not "suitable wife material" because of the colour of her skin.  Girls, guys, we all know this happens even now in the supposed enlightened 21st century!  All of Anju's dilemmas have been suffered by many an Indian girl both in India or abroad, we are bound by the loving but sometimes harsh family ties that bind, and most of us ultimately want to please our families even if they drive us to distraction.  The characters are believable and very human and the story is an absolute treat that needs to be looked at in the context of the subject matter.  Basically Indian families want their daughters to marry well; happiness is not obligatory but would be a bonus but for Anju finding the right person is what matters and sometimes you have to compromise and meet in the middle if at all possible.  Oh and the reason I am quite amused by the critical reviews of the Indian audience of this novel is because of how righteously indigent they all sound, don't you think, the audience doth protest too much here? 
      A book both boys and girls will find enjoyable, as stated by parents I have surveyed.  Round as a Mooncake presents shaped items children come across when living in or near an Asian community, or if they have Asian friends.  This book does an excellent job introducing words and terms to children from a time-rich culture (i.e., mooncake, name chop, lucky money).  The illustrations capture one's attention.  The colors of the images presented are rich and vibrant.  There are enough well known objects children recognize to be comfortable with if not familiar with some of the new terms (i.e., pizza, window, cell phones.  The glossary is an added bonus, introducing resources for children 
 This is worth buying, if for no other reason than John Elephante's (The lead singer for Kansas in the 80's) song - "Young and Innocent,"   That song is only released on this album as, far as I know 
 Quill and his cats move into Ms. Cobbs house after they find out she dies.  They move there to try to find out why she died. Tis book was written very well.  I liked it because it was suspenseful at some points but in other times you knew exactly what was going on.  I recommend this book to any older teenagers 
 I love this toy. My baby cousin who is 21 months old was over and just played with it. Nothing ever kepps her busy for over 10 min. but this toy did. The toys are very hard to find 
 I did like this book. It was very easy to read and the step by step crafts where easy to follow. The recipies were a surprise to me and the ones I tried were very good. I am thinking about preapering some of the features  for my family 
 This is a very good book.  It let you know what your standing really is with God.  It has great examples of what the author is trying to express in each chapter.  This is a book that I would recommend to every christian that wants to understand who they are in Christ 
 When Bob Sheehan passed away, Blues Traveler reinvented itself with a new bassist and the addition of Ben Wilson on keys.  I can't imagine them now without this line-up.  As good as they were before, this new lineup suits them very well and seems to have allowed them to really diversify their range of expression.  Bridge, their first album with this new lineup, was AMAZING, one of their strongest records, and Truth Be Told is a solid follow up. The songs aren't as catchy as on Bridge, but they really grow on you.  They are complex, yet very lyrical.  And there is still space for jamming.  The new Blues Traveler is distinct from the old one, and this new CD proves that they are evolving well in this new configuration.   Blues Traveler is one of my favorite bands and I love what they're doing now 
 This is an outstanding book for those folks in manufacturing who are starting out on their "Lean" journey. The book teaches the uninitiated an original thinker's way of recognizing "waste" in manufacturing, and often, how to deal with that waste. Taiichi Ohno took a "shipload" of this book with him to Japan in the '50s and made sure that every Toyota engineer read the book. The rest is history as to how Toyota packaged this information for the rest of the world, including the United States, in its now famous "7 wastes of manufacturing." You will enjoy the book and learn what an outstanding visionary Henry Ford really was 
 The Deluxe Top & Side Entry Checkbook Cover is a well made leather product. It has the "feel" of a sturdy long lasting product. The only down side I find with it; is the size. It is very large. This may be a good thing to some as there is plenty of room for deposit receipts , register etc. For women it really isn't a big problem if they have a pocketbook with ample room. It isn't a "feminine" item by any means. It is designed more for men. Though it will take the room of a whole pocket to carry it. Being a woman myself, I really don't mind the fact that it isn't feminine looking. I don't plan on using it for fashion. I just want a checkbook cover that won't fall apart in a years time and one I can keep more than a few checks in. For my needs it is working out fine. I wish it was a tad smaller, but then there wouldn't be all that room. You always have to trade off one thing for another in almost anything you have. All in all this is just what I wanted.   
 A wonderful, haunting story that ultimately gets to the heart of what  fantasy--and stories--are all about 
 I love Victor Conte. You know, the way you love the bad guy in a great movie? You don't actually love him, but you love the character, the kind of "best actor nominee" thing.    Two San Francisco Chronicle reporters lay out their case against Conte and his Giant client, Barry Bonds, as Bonds passes Babe Ruth and eyes Hank Aaron for the all-time home run record (Josh Gibson and Sadaharu Oh?).  Conte himself is alleged to be the source for much of the material.  The investigations continue: in spring 2006, Bonds' ex-girlfriend, Kim Bell, was allegedly asked by the FBI not to cooperate with the investigation Major League Baseball is doing; Greg Anderson, Bonds' trainer, was jailed in July 2006 for refusing to testify to the grand jury.  The authors present extensive evidence about the use of steroids in track and field, provided to Olympic athletes by Conte under the cover of his nutritional supplements company, and the increasingly sophisticated efforts to mask such use.  But it is the Barry Bonds allegations (along with the accompanying details on other Major Leaguers, and efforts to explain Mark McGwire's glory as Bonds' motivation) that sell the book. This book makes Bonds look much worse than I thought it would, and I was no fan already. The reader learns, for example, about his being a "control freak" with his teammates, women, staff and "friends." My own judgment is that the authors easily surpass "preponderance of the evidence" and probably "beyond a reasonable doubt", even if they don't have video of Bonds with a syringe labeled "The Clear."  On the other hand, there is no video, and no (public) record of Bonds ever failing a steroids test.  The authors try to explain why.  In appendices, the authors detail the Bonds' remarkable statistical achievements from age 35 to 39, alongside those of other greats who by that age are in decline.    They got Al Capone on tax fraud, Alger Hiss on perjury, Martha Stewart on obstruction of justice and O.J. in civil court.  They may never get Bonds on steroids, but whether or not he breaks Aaron's record, these authors have written Bonds' epitaph. 
 Okay, let's cut to the chase - if you are here, you are here for a reason.   Save His Soul, definitely stands out from the rest of the Blues Traveler  albums.  Although not necesarily for the best, the album rings of a  undefined, inquisitive nature.  It feels more of an ¨attempt¨ rather than a  natural offspring, but nonetheless, still rocks and excites the listener.   Trina Magna, Whoops, and Go Out Side & Drive are the principal driving  forces off this one, while the harmonica on ¨Fledging¨ is simply beautiful.   Some of the songs though are better live - Love and Greed - NY PROPHESIE -   for example, and ¨Love of My Live¨ is grows more valuable with each  listen.  Overall, much more focused delivering the point of J.P. through  writing, but essential, to me, nonetheless 
 I hope you enjoy the excellent poetry of Aleister Crowley as much as I did. I was able to read huge chunks at a time I liked it so much. The first day I read it I read about half the book. Extremely blasphemous poetry rivaling even Lord Byron and Edgar Allen Poe. Even though he is controversial, Aleister Crowley is the all time icon of the occult. Besides that, he is an under-rated gothic icon. On occasion, whole books of Crowley such as this could be looked at as gothic. Crowley is the creator of the Thoth Tarot, and tarot has a large gothic following amongst non-Christian goths. Crowley is definately a love it or hate it persona. Satanists told me Thelema is anathema to the Satanist. These "satanists" are pretenders to the throne. Crowley is the original occult icon; the rest are imitators. I have seen it and it could be argued ever other occultist plagarized Crowley...because he is the original. Just like Lafenu was the original vampire writer. Crowley is has been getting popular. 
 I pick up any sequel to Peter Pan with much skepticisim, however is this was the first that has been officially sanctioned I figured I would give it a go.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It holds very true to Barrie's tale, McCaughrean is clearly familiar with not only the original work, but Barrie's life and his other writings (I caught at least on allusion to his other work).  It also has a sort of wistful sadness that I have encountered in the non-Pan writings of Barrie's that I have read.  What was great about this was how she found a way to bring back the characters that are essential for any Neverland tale, instead of creating a whole slew of new ones.  And she tells it in a way that is very much Barrie, of course the way to get to Neverland is the fly, and to fly you have to be a child--how do grownups like Mrs.Wendy become children again? I love it!  And it has some very interesting outcomes.  The Darlings have been having dreams of Neverland, dreams so vivid that when they wake up they've brought part of it back with them (water from the Mermaid lagoon, Indian warpaint, etc).  Knowing something must be wrong they resolve to return to Neverland and help Peter Pan fix the problem.  They return to Neverland and the longer they are there the more they forget about why they are there, thus a series of adventures happen.  Including meeting up with some pirates and a Traveling Man, Ravello.  He is probably the jewel of this book, with him the plot drives further and the reader wants to turn more pages.  Peter as his arrogant self can only inspire so much.  In addition to Ravello there is another great new character, Firefly, a male fairy--and very hungry, everytime he pops up I found myself laughing at something.  I loved the illustrations on the inside, like black cutouts that used to be the chapter pages in older children's books, very appropriate--also like shadows (Very important).   There are a few minor quibbles I have with the book, 1) she states that one cannot fly without a shadow--yet Peter flies in at the begining of Barrie's book looking for his shadow--thus, he can fly without one. 2) I'm not sure how much I like the big reveal of Hook's past, while it does seem to fit in with what perhaps Barrie spoke of for him...it seems to make him less piratey.  That being said, I really enjoyed this book, it will be a great book to read aloud at bed times or for a gift for a child, the reading level isn't super advances so probably 3rd or 4th grade 
 I used this text for 2 semesters of Organic Chemistry. I thought it was fantastic, with very colorful, helpful electrostatic potential maps. It showed clear reaction mechanisms and gave a summary of all learned reactions at the end of the chapter.  If you need to learn Organic chem, McMurry is the way to go.  EDIT  It's now 2006 and I wrote that review in 2004. McMurry is an excellent guide to sophomore organic chemistry, and it leads well into more complicated texts, such as Dougherty's Physical Organic, March's Advanced Organic, or the dual Carey Advanced Organic tests. When I started grad school, I had to take the ACS Diagnostic test in organic chemistry and I aced it, largely from the material that I learned from this book 
 Patty Loveless' "Mountain Soul" remains a modern classic 5 years after its original release.  On "The Richest Fool Alive" she croons soulfully.  She goes country gospel on Ralph Stanley's classic "Daniel Prayed" with Ricky Scaggs' counterpoint vocals and furious mandolin making the track jump alive.  On Melba Montgomery's "Out of Control Raging Fire," Travis Tritt joins Patty for harmonies that seem to float like smoke up to the clouds.  The bluegrass gospel "Rise Up Lazarus" is a lovely melody that will place you in the Little Brown Church of your childhood, "Go forth John & Paul, spread the gospel to them all, Give them courage to believe & they shall be released."  "You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive" is moaning country blues, an epitaph to folks who knew about hard living and getting by.  This is an incredibly strong set with no weak tracks.  Patty's singing is soulful and moving.  Bravo!   
 Having read several of Ford's other novels previously, I pretty much got what I had expected and had hoped for.  No need for outrageous plot twists, chase scenes, or bawdry dialogues.  The disintegration of this family showed me that people never stop growing, learning, and succumbing to not what is expected but what feels right at a particular point in one's life 
  What is wonderful about this book, is that the thesis is very academic, as is the thinking behind it, but the book is marvelously accessible to the general reader!  Shapiro's thesis is that the public events of 1599 (The Irish Rebellion, the fall of Essex, the fear of a second Armada, and the nearing succession of Eliz. I - of which it was treasonous to speak) and the events in the personal/professional life of WS (the new theater, the loss of his popular comic actor, the unauthorized publication of his poems and the aquisition of his family coat of arms) joined to make WS not just a talented playwright, but the best of all times.  Shapiro uses WS text and to illustrate his points. He shows one of the unauthorized poems side by side with the version WS eventually published.  The later one, with very little change in words has tremendous change in meaning, rendering the first, a sloppy and cynical sentiment, and the second a seasoned and honest tribute.  Similarly he takes lines of the 1599 plays, to show us their relevance to the times.  Among the simple things that we moderns would never note is in Julius Ceasar, Brutus, asks about the calendar.  Moderns would relate this only to the soothsayer's prediction about the Ides of March, Elizbethans to their calindrical confusions with with the continent in not having the (Papal) Julian calendar.  The descriptions of the times are wonderful.  He speculates on how book burning, the climate of fear of a Spanish attack, childhood memories of churches losing their stained glass windows and a trip home could have influenced WS.  We see WS browsing in bookstores and riding to Stratford.  Shapiro speculates on how much of the fall of Essex was known to WS and the general public.  This is an amazing book. I'd love to take a course from Prof. Shapiro!  Thank you to the author! 
 For a small plug in device, the germ guardian circulates a large portion of air through the UV light area, and germs are killed. You can smell fresh clean air immediately. The fact that the UV kills many kinds of bacteria, the cold and flu virus, and serious bacteria such as anthrax, I find this impressive and it really works well. Fifty dollars well spent to prevent illness in the home 
 This is a first-class David Mamet film of indirection, understatement and cool emotion. A young cadet at the Royal Naval Academy has been expelled for stealing a five-shilling postal order from another cadet. He swears to his father that he didn't do it and his father believes him. At that point Arthur Winslow (Nigel Hawthorne) becomes determined to prove his son innocent. He is rebuffed by the Admiralty because, as part of the Queen's government, the Admiralty can do no wrong and cannot be sued. He engages a famous solicitor, Sir Robert Morton (Jeremy Northam), who agrees to take the brief. Morton eventually succeeds in bringing the case before the House of Commons on a petition of right, where even the lowest of the Queen's subjects can have the opportunity "to have right be done." All this takes years. The Winslow family suffers ridicule and financial distress. Arthur Winslow's daughter, Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon), a prickly and intelligent suffragette, sees her opportunity for an advantageous marriage evaporate. His son is forced to leave Oxford and take a banking job. His wife sees so much of the security of the home vanish in the costs of the case. The case, based on a true happening, finally is won.  Mamet's screenplay is based on the Forties play by Terence Rattigan. It's a solid piece of work that keeps the story moving and concentrates on the characters. The interplay among the characters is excellent, especially between Catherine Winslow and Sir Robert Morton. The dialogue may be on the surface exquisitely courteous, but underneath runs unexpected currents that are a lot of fun to witness. Northam's Morton is smart, secure, successful and not at all sympathetic to suffragettes. But it gradually becomes clear he rather likes intelligent women and that the end of the case may not be the last Catherine Winslow sees of him:  Sir Robert Morton: You still pursue your feminist activities?  Catherine Winslow: Oh yes.  Sir Robert: Pity. It's a lost cause.  Catherine: Oh, do you really think so, Sir Robert? How little you know about women. Good-bye. I doubt that we shall meet again.  Sir Robert: Do you really think so, Miss Winslow? How little you know about men.   It has always seemed strange to me that those who like Mamet almost never mention this movie, yet it appears to me that this is one of his most solidly directed and written films. It may be that, like Scorsese's Age of Innocence, it just doesn't fit into preconceived notions of what the director's films should be like. At any rate, this is a clever and satisfying movie, and very well acted 
 Christopher Titus is easily the best argument for a person being able to pull themselves out of a rough childhood and making something of himself - and if you don't know why, you're about to learn.  Titus has made a career out of laughing at his life and his family: his clinically insane genius mother, his verbally abusive drunk father, and of course his own hijinks . . . and now he's bringing his children into the mix.  Not as the target of his wit, but as the catalyst for his new material.  It's a world gone mad following 9-11-01 and he's got a brand new daughter to try to protect while trying to hold on to his marriage (a battle he'd sadly lose, though not at the time the CD was recorded) and his sanity.    Titus takes you through his hilarious views on President Bush ("Our President"), the white race's feelings of guilt towards the other races ("Whitey"), his boneheaded mistakes as a parent (the "Incident" tracks), his time touring Iraq with the troops ("Our Troops" through "Sgt. Pepper"), his views on the Catholic church's child abuse problem ("P***phile Crucifixions") and the loss of his his father - and the amazing way his dad wanted to be sent into the next world.  Through it all you never get a sense of despair or worry, just a good-natured guy trying to slog through one challenge after another and finding the humor in every situation.  Is it better than "Norman Rockwell is Bleeding?"  I don't know.  It's just as hysterical, only with a new focus.    Bottom line, it's not another one of those comedy albums with a bunch of lame observations about the little oddities of life - it's a witty jab at the big issues in life and the little children who get him through, and it's a gem.  Do yourself a favor and give it a listen 
 This is one of the most shocking books I have read.  It proves what Gary Webb has been trying to tell the American people for years.  That the CIA sponsored contras were little more that a organized crime unit that funneled narcotics. Read this boo 
 This book has great historical information on the Scalamandre family and brand in addition to fabulous room photos 
 oh... it's so hard to watch a David Lynch movie. Why? b/c it's so good and awful gut wrenching all the same. Willem Defoe is amazing, yet again, in another movie. And may the Lord with all His bounty give praise to the mother and her boyfriend. For those two are surely among the underpraised in at least my life and I as I look Your lives as well. Hype and Yipe and your own Hyenaes. As that mother made me wish for my own forthcoming I shall fornicate upon your's. I just don't like the sex in this movie. Every else is great. The Jack Nance part, the "can I use your head" part, the weeping beauty at the end, and all the Twin Peaks cameos you didn't want but have now seen.  "There's fire on the mountain. rising in the air" as I write this. I work on an oil rig and find David Lynch to be a soft sanctuary to those who thought through birth a life once given is often left forgiven. A mound of praise for a fellow hope ally, but maybe not.... maybe we are not....  God bless, Nick Ra 
      I agree with most of your reviewers--Laughlin's book is not Nobel    stuff.  But give a point.  It shows a laid back theorist who has    earned his prize already, and is easing into another perhaps more    important area of physics.  In amongst his vignettes of personal    life he is pointing ahead in the understanding of our cosmos.     All "beyond physics" scientific progress emphasizes emergence.    Take for instance the guidance of DNA in evolution.  I would in-    clude also the precise definition of the forces of nature. Any-    body out there with ideas to help this concept along?       
 Although Dales books are quite old the concepts he introduces remain tried and true. I have read another of dales books  "How to win friends and influence people" And they are both fantastic. This book in particuliar i see as being of great value to anyone who has ever struggled with public speaking.  
 I lent my copy to my master class art teacher 5 months ago.  She keeps begging for more time with it.  I'm just going to buy a second copy, and let her keep the first.  Do you need to know any more 
 Hi my name is Maegan.I read a wonderful book called Half Magic.It is by Ed Eager and illistrated by N.M Bodecker.It is a fictoin fantisy.The charicters are Carrie, Jane, Mark, Martha, Merlin, Ma, Ms.Bick, and Mr.smith.The problem is their wishes get out of order.A interesting part is when the cat half talks!I think you should read this book!  
 This is a great CD with some good oldies. Bought it for a couple of the included titles but liked all others. Worth buying if you like italian flavored oldies 
 A well researched and documented book by a smart guy with a real passion for his subject and compassion for the people impacted. His book YOUR DRUG MAY BE YOUR PROBLEM might be a good running start to get up to dealing with this sizable thing. It is an outstanding gift to patients as they are never told this stuff nor are their lved ones 
 I began reading this book with trepidation, because I worried that a book about the Marines and basketball might be a little too masculine and juvenile even for someone who tends to enjoy books with that character, but I was pleasantly mistaken. This is a great book--not just good, but great--about a career Marine who has established himself as a hero in war, leader within the Corps and one of the most bombastic, foul mouthed and party-hearty personalities anywhere, but a man who has no idea how to alter his personality at home. His family, which dutifully follows him around the South, admires his professional abilities and follows his orders almost without question also live in terror of the man who rules with an iron fist and absues them emotionally and physically. Bull Meecham is truly one of the great characters and personalities from any fiction I've read.  The other members of the family, however, are also just as valuable and interesting in this book. Bull's son's attempts to be a man, his wife's attempts to rear her children with Southern charm and grace despite their father, the oldest daughter's attempts to be an independent woman despite both of her parents. The Great Santini goes further, however, and explores racism in the mid-century South, the power of sports in youth culture, the troubled existence of military families, etc.   Pat Conroy is a beautiful writer who creates lifelike characters, produces huge laughs and equally large tragedies, and never lets a dull moment slip into this book. This is one of my favorite books I've ever read and will highly recommend it to anyone I meet. 
 This is a great book and it gives you so much inside knowledge and information of what the family really went through 
 Any Movie that ends with "Nessum Dorma" is cool - period.  Think of the longing, the sweetness, the power of the song itself and you get some idea of how this movie will kick you in the gut when you least expect it.  Bridges is awesome in his role -- totally unselfconsciousness, completely believable, absolutly wonderful, and Streisand is strong and brave in hers -- so what's not to love? All those who hated it, watch it again.  All of you who haven't seen it, watch it.  If you've got a speck of romance in your soul, and a song in your heart, you'll get it.  
 This is Tupac's debut album and the rawest, very lyrically good with three singles Trapped, If My Homie Calls and Brenda's Got A Baby. My favourite famous song would have to be Trapped where he talks about jail etc however Brenda's Got A Baby and If My Homie Calls are amazing songs with great beats etc. In the non famous song's Soulja's Story has to be my favourite with his soulja voice and great beats. Other great songs are Young Black Male, I Don't Give A F***, Violent, Words Of Wisdom, Something Wicked, Rebel Of The Underground and Part Time Mutha.   This is a good album to get to start your Tupac collection, listen to Tupac when he started in the rap scene. You will not be dissapointed 
 Most every classical guitarist should own at least a couple of the famous Noad books. "The Baroque Guitar" is one of my favorites, because of the composers and materials chosen for the book, particularly the Bach and Sanz pieces. As another review stated, this book is good for both instruction and performance, as the pieces in it are certainly worthy for the stage, and the duets are a nice touch, too.   Any classical guitarist that goes through this book will definitely have a good knowledge of the great classical repertoire that is available, and to have it all in one book is a nice feature. Noad's books are always well organized, however I frequently do not agree with his provided fingerings, as there are other fingerings that would make more sense, but that is a minor issue. The tunes included make up for that. One of my absolute favorites to play is the beautiful Bach "Sarabande," originally written for violin, but reproduced here in accurate fashion. Other tunes to check out in the book are the Bach "Double," Sanz's "Canarios," and the featured duets for two-guitars.   Overall this is a great book and is highly recommended. The only thing I would suggest to the buyer is don't be afraid to figure out and try some alternate fingerings 
 I usually wear a size 9, but went with an 8, and it fit great. My feet an so nice and warm- but not sweaty! Best slippers ever-  I wore them all weekend 
 White Point seemed like the kind of place anyone would want to live as long as you could get rid of the people.  Fascinating how the author, Tim Winton, chose to populate a beautiful coastal town with mean and nasty people.  Makes you wonder as you read the book if the harshness of eking out an existence in White Point, with the intense heat and the demanding fishing industry, results in harsh people.    I must confess that of the two protagonists, Georgie and Lu, I empathized more with Lu.  He was a man with real, heart rendering pain in his life; an Australian Job.  Winton seems to take Lu to the edge of death in order for Lu to bury the dead and return to the living.  As a counterpoint, Georgie, a nurse surrounded by the pain and death of patients, loses her desire to really live.  She moves in with a widower because she pities him.  What she doesn't realize is that he invited her because he pitied her.  Pity, they realize, is a poor foundation for a relationship.    When Georgie and Lu meet by accident, it sets in motion the events that will transform and heal them. 
 Great examples of innovative building skins with good details. Highly recommended for architects and architecture lovers 
 This is one of Hayes's first "instructional" books  on ninjutsu, and it does a good job teaching the "basics."  Hundreds and hundreds of great pictures saturate most of the pages, making it an  easy-to-follow guide for beginners.  Still, it's hard to learn simply by  following Hayes's movements.  The reader ought to have some understanding  of the fundamentals--ideally through  lessons from a certified Bujinkan  instructor--before putting this book's techniques to use.  Nonetheless,  it's a great one to read and to own.  Hayes, of course, is more than  qualified as an instructor.  I own almost all of his literature, and I  enjoy reading them over and over as a reminder for the basics.  It still  feels like I gain something new every time I read one of his books--an  excellent complement to ninjutsu classes 
 This book is a nonstop adventure that will have you asking for more.  It moves at 90mph and that is just after reading the first chapter.  Crichton has always used science to concieve his ideas and bring them to life and Time Line is no different.  You will be convinced these chracters are having an experience that knowone could imagine.  The trip back to early Europe is filled with extreme detail making this a learning experience on the way.  If you want a good thrilling ride of a book check it out 
 I absolutly loved this movie. An unlikely friendship is at the center of this wonderful movie that quite frankly had a surprisingly magical ending. In an upper class neighborhood in the state of Kentucky, a young man (Rockwell) who landscapes for the snobby residents befriends a 10 year old girl (Mischa Barton). She is the daughter of one of the most well known couples (Christopher McDonald & Kathleen Quinlan) in the neighborhood. The unlikely friendship becomes quite the upset once it's discovered. Everyone thinks that Sam Rockwell's character is trash. He lives in a rundown trailer down a gravel road thats near their upper class estates. No one understands the friendship that Trent and Devon have. Devon likes Trent because he's different and they have a little something in common. LAWN DOGS is funny, touching, and just a very satisfying movie. If you've just watched this movie I would like to request that you read Roger Ebert's review on LAWN DOGS, the highly respected critic totally missed the point of the movie, he gave it one and a half stars. Note that he asks 'why this?' & 'why that?', thats the whole point ..WHY?. The film allows you to draw your own conclusions. LAWN DOGS is a very underrated film 
 This book (series) keeps my attention like a John Grisham book.  The writing style is easy reading and it keeps me glued to the books.  I couldn't wait to get to book five to find out about Amanda and her true alliance.  I am glad I started reading this series after all the books were published so I can just keep going from book to book without a lull 
 Tod Friendly, a doctor living in the US, dies.  Somehow an alter ego of Dr. Friendly is born during his death and proceeds to live his life backwards.  He watches people walk backwards and talk backwards as he lives Friendly's life in reverse all the way back to his birth. We find out that the good doctor hides a horrible secret in his past-He was a Holocaust Doctor who experimented on Jews and others at Auschwitz during World War 2.     Amis uses this unique approach and it works well until the very end which I thought got a little too mystical for me.  It is a short book (I agree with others who say that any longer and the backwards-in-time trick would've been a bit much) that is at time hilarious and powerful.  Reading the section about his experimentations on the prisoners in Aushwitz was horrible, and the irony of the whole situation (since the doctor's alter ego is watching it backward, he believes that many Jews were actually brought to life by the death camp) is not lost at all.  I highly recommend it 
 While not quite a masterpiece like Moral Animal (1994)- ultimately, the writing is too diffuse and meandering- NZ is the more ambitious work.  Wright takes a macroscopic view of human society, describing quite convicingly how the "arrow" of civilization is leading to greater complexity and networking- to a "global village" perhaps as the media pundits predict.  The debateable thing is Wright discusses the long-term benefits of disaster, human conflicts, and war in particular.  Certainly, war ultimately brings different groups together and leads to technical progress: in that sense, WWII was a "great" thing- it led to the near unification of Europe into 2 sides (divided by the Iron Curtain) after centuries of discord.  Even the Holocaust was "positive" since it led to the decline of anti-Semitism and racism. (People today forget how socially acceptable it used to be.)  So are we getting better in every possible way :)  And yet, on an individual level- from the timespan of a human lifetime- why should any of us care about that 
 This book is a must read.  As a Jewish girl who grew up in an Arab country, I had to study the Arab view of history.  This view was never questioned.  The Prophet (and even non-Muslims were forced to say Peace Be Upon Him, but I won't), killed an entire Jewish tribes, and Arab children are taught that this is only right.  The teacher said "they deserved it".  When I meet Israelis and Frenchmen, they question their past.  Arabs do not.  Particularly interesting is how the author shows continuity across centuries, and he takes us all the way to Gamal Abd el Nasser.  I have a lot of respect for this historian 
 In Long Day's Journey Into Night, O'Neill gives readers a tragic/comedic/suspenseful play which portrays a loving family experiencing the hardships that some family's must face throughout their lives. The play takes place during one August day in the 1900's in the Tyrone's summer home. A day that's outcome would change everything.  One of the main reasons I believe the play was written so well is because of the connection to O'Neill's real life experiences. All of the characters in the play actually reflect O'Neill's real family, with the exception of Edmund who is really Eugene himself.   Although the play is clearly meant to be dramatic, O'Neill offers some comedic relief to lighten up the mood at times, mostly from the 2 brothers (James and Edmund). I found it also very suspenseful the way O'Neill led on that something was wrong with the mother (Mary) but the reader doesn't receive any information on what exactly it is until one of the last acts, which for me made the play very interesting because I wanted to keep reading to learn exactly what was going on. I found the play very easy to read also because of the scene description at the beginning of every Act therefore, in the unfortunate event that you have not seen the play (like myself) the description helps you imagine exactly what the scene would look like.  I also found the play very refreshing in the sense that it was not completely full of happiness and love, the family did not sail off into the sunset and live happily ever after.  O'Neill delivers a very heartfelt tragedy, the play was written to be dramatic, with the mother's morphine addiction and her fall from rehabilitation, and also Edmund's sickness. However, with all of these obstacles the family must overcome the family clearly continues to love one another unconditionally. The reader can see how obvious this love is between the parents and the children, husband and wife and the boys to one another. Readers can see this because O'Neill wrote about something he knew much about, and wrote it from his heart. In his dedication to his wife O'Neill writes, "I mean it as a tribute to your love and tenderness which gave me the faith in love and enabled me to face my dead at last and write this play write it wish deep pity and understanding and forgiveness for all the four haunted Tyrones." So it would seem as if O'Neill forgave his family which gave him the strength and courage to write one of the best stories I have ever read 
 In compilation of his articles written over a period of 20 years, Twight provides a harsh and bittering look to an extreme alpinist's , a punk's, and a man's world who keeps losing friends, year by year. One can really figure out inner development of Twight, who sought more and more complex, unrepeated routes every year, which have been crowned by 63 hour ascent of Czech Direct on Denali. On his way to alpine perfection, Twight sees experiences near death situations, success, loss of friends, breaking up from intimate ones, the trust amd the alchemy of partnership, dysfunctional family, etc.. As his rage gets calmer, but the passion gets deeper, he shaves more and more of his attitude to alpinism for perfection, just like a samurai who keeps fighting not anymore for war, but the way of the sword and inner peace gained looking for it.  The book, which can mean much to any alpinist or a climber, may present an interesting account to read for anyone on armchair 
 I remember when I bought this album, as I drove away listening, I turned back immediately to return it because the 1st song struck me as way too syrupy, and I was immediately disappointed.  I kept repeating it as I drove back, and ended up listening to the 1st three songs a couple of times, and decided to turn around again and give it a chance.  I am not one for syrupy, sentimental music, but the thing about this album, is that Teenage Fanclub is obviously trying to make a well recorded album, bucking the low-fi trend at the time.  It's funny that a rock band would have to defend, or isn't cool because, they are trying to write, record and perform as well as they can.  If you can look past that, this album is perfect from start to finish, a totally professional A+ performance 
 Yall should get this album if you haven't heard it yet...BIg Daddy Kane was one of the greates mc's of his time and ever...This is a classic album that set the blueprint for a whole lot of other rappers to follow  Great album , get i 
 The features you need, the advice you want, the examples you'll refer to again and again: that's what you'll find in this book. The experience and insights that the authors bring to this book have made it one of my favorites among computer books in general and my total favorite among Photoshop books. I recommend this edition of the Bible to anyone who has already used most of the basic features and wants some expert advice to move them on to the next level. The "Professional" tag is appropriate, but you don't need to be an expert to use the book: that's where it takes you. Don't expect this book to baby you and for every single button and dialog box to be covered, because this is a book focused on the features you use for more advanced projects, and the work that pushes the edge of the design envelope. If you're looking for coverage of everything in the Photoshop menus and tools, get the main CS2 Bible, the one that's like 1500 pages. If you want to learn specific stuff to take your work to the next level, the Professional Edition is the one you want. 
 Some of his last cd's have sucked but this is true REK going back to his roots in south Texas music, I only dislike one song on this cd, (we had a great night on stage in Shiner and on his bus) whatever, I think it's a great CD and I recommend it to all my Houston friends.  Viva San Antonio! 
 The most significant contribution of James Davison Hunter's Culture Wars resides in the controversy and extensive scholarship that followed the publication of his book.  In this work Hunter examines the discourse and  methodologies of contempporary social movement organizations, and arrives  at an interesting conclusion: while denominational differences may have  declined in the second half of the 20th century, significant struggles  within the realm of religion remain.  The main divide that the author  focuses on is that between the "orthodox" and  "progressives."  While the author does an admirable job of making  connections between politics, religion, and social movements, his final  anaylsis seems a bit simplistic.  Hunter suggests that most of the current  debates within American public culture can be expressed as struggles  between two monolithic groups.  However, other authors who have responded  to Hunter's work have taken issue with this point, arguing that in terms of  attitudes toward economic justice, the alignments that Hunter describes do  not hold.  In general, Hunter has provided an accessible, provocative  account of contemporary conflicts in the public realm.  His conclusions  about what these conflicts mean for the future of American democracy are  also quite insightful.  The main limitation of the work is that his  analysis may be overly simplistic, with not enough attention paid to the  nuances of the debates that he describes 
 I did not read this book, but purchased it for my niece, who will be delivering twins tomorrow.  She raved about it 
 If animals could talk, they things they would say! But they can't talk - or can they?

 A few years before this movie came out, a movie called "Tommy" came out. This movie took the concept album of The Who's "Tommy" and transferred it to the big-screen, using only music and absolutely no dialogue to further the story along. I never turn off a movie, no matter how bad I think it is. Except "Tommy." In reality, the film wasn't bad...It just annoyed me. There was a huge lack of entertainment going on. I wasn't expecting much from The Wall, but I've heard so many good things about it. I had to see it. Let me say, I haven't heard a lot of Pink Floyd stuff. I've only listened to four albums (Umma Gumma, Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother, and Wish You Were Here). Yes, that's right. I haven't even heard The Wall album. This film is simalar to Tommy in the fact that Pink Floyd's music plays throughout the film. The difference is, there is some dialogue in the film although it doesn't move the plot along at all. The other difference is, this film has amazing visuals and is fun to watch. The movie's plot is basically a rock star named Pink (Bob Geldof) sits watching a war movie and begins to remember his childhood. Blended in is memories, fantasies, and a bunch of other [...] that results in one trippy movie to watch. But, as I said, the visuals are what keep you watching. The movie's metaphors (especially the title one) are very smart, the script is by Roger Waters (although I don't know how a person could write a script like this). If you're a Floyd fan/arty kinds of films, check this out for sure. All movies, in my opinion, are forms of art...But this film is actually like a work of art. Anyway, if you're just a moviegoer looking for some entertainment on a Saturday night...This isn't the movie for you.  GRADE: A 
 Forgiveness is one of the keys to surviving loss and pain. It is something we do for ourselves. To release hurt is to our own advantage. To hold it  will kill us. This is a wonderful book and an important tool for living 
 This is one of the most well-known and most frequently recommended breast feeding book.  It has lots of facts, and I conferred the book for help many many times (I had much difficulty with nursing).  However, while breast is best, and should be encouraged, books shouldn't idolize it as the only acceptable way.  I felt that the book was unrealistically positive about the nursing experience and that if you latch correctly, it won't hurt and nursing will be a blissful experience.  Most women that I know who have nursed will agree with me when I say that even if you latch correctly, nursing is very difficult and books like this doesn't present a realitic picture of how difficult it is.   I also couldn't find anything about what you can do if you are having difficulty pumping-- which makes me think that the book discourages pumping (i.e., nurse every and all the time) and it won't discuss any practice that it discourages.  Surprising number of women have difficulty pumping, although NO ONE TALKS ABOUT IT.  Another example is supplementing with formula-- book says supplementing is the beginning of the end of nursing and that's all it says.  Basically, it simply says to just say no to any formula or pumping 
 I read this book in 9 hours cover to cover last night, and as usual Nikki has produced another page turner.  This book was just as good as the original.  I'm ready to see what's next for Miss Richmond, VA!  
 "Let Fury Have the Hour" by Antonino D'Ambrosio is a thrilling book that engages as well as entertains.  D'Ambrosio has put together a book that brilliantly places Joe Strummer, a ground-breaking musician and committed activist, as a model of what he describes as "creative-activism."  The book's structure is wonderfully laid out, as D'Ambrosio builds from Strummer's early days with the Clash in the first section Let Fury Have the Hour, which includes essays by D'Ambrosio, Greil Marcus, Lester Bangs, and Sylvie Simmons.  The following sections, "The Rebel Way," "You Can't Have A Revolution without Songs" and "The World is Worth Fighting For," are highlighted by some of the most original and challenging writings on art and activism, and certainly about Strummer and punk music.  Standout essays include Charlie Bretsch's "Always Paying Attention" and Amy Philips' "A Brother in Revolution."  Two essays by D'Ambrosio really captured my imagination with writing that is wholly original and passionate.  These include "You Can't Have a Revolution Without Songs," which discusses Strummer as a political folk musician in the tradition of Caetano Veleso, Victor Jara, Silvio Rodriquez and others.  The second is "White Riot vs Right Riot," which looks at punk, anti-racism and Strummer's commitment to racial and cultural justice.  And it seems that D'Ambrosio has a line to every actor, musician, artist who has ever been influenced by Strummer as there are interviews with Tim Robbins, Michael Franti, Jim Jarmusch, just to name a few. The book is perfect for Strummer/Clash fans as they will l learn something new through D'Ambrosio's unique approach to various subjects--Strummer, punk, the Clash, political activism etc.  And essays will enjoy the essays from the likes of Billy Bragg and Chuck D, two pieces that deeply moved me.  "Let Fury Have the Hour" is excellent for young people, who will learn the importance of fusing creativity with a sense of social justice.  It will be inspirational for artists, activists and everyone in between as the book is comes at a important time.  As D'Ambrosio writes in the introduction, "echoing a favorite expression of Strummer-the future is indeed unwritten, how we write it offers us all a grand hope and a compelling opportunity. 
 I've owned my Pur dispenser for two years now. I certainly recommend it as a cost saving device. Our city water tastes terrible, but I'm too frugal to spend $1 per bottle at the store [and throw all of those empty bottles in the landfill!]. I only have to replace the filters twice a year. My total cost for about a gallon of filtered water per day for the last two years is $2.50 per month, including the dispenser.   I am notoriously clumsy, and I've dropped the lid a few times but aside from a few minor scratches my dispenser looks the same as the day I bought it. The plastic hasn't discolored. When I purchased it I was certain the lever would break within the year but the spring is still tightly wound and it is leakproof.   The flavor of the water is far superior to many bottled water brands, which seem slightly bitter to me. One can find less expensive filters online. I strongly recommend this product 
 This edition includes three of Sheridan's most famous works.  "The Rivals" and "The Critic" are both fine plays, but the best by far is "The School for Scandal", a droll farce which lampoons  gossip-mongers.  The high point of the play is the famous "screen  scene", in which one character after another takes refuge behind a  screen to eavesdrop.  The humor is sharp but never bitter, and the  characters are wholly believable.  It is easy to see why this play is still  being performed after two hundred years 
 Yancey strikes again.  This time he presents a very down-to-earth portrait of Jesus that forces the faithful to think more about Jesus' humanity than we are often comfortable with.  Jesus was after all a real person who lived in a real world -- a Jewish world.  I love it when Yancey makes me think about things I don't really want to -- but need to.   He did it again! 
 As a 17 year old high school student, I knew next to nothing about jazz before reading this book. John Szwed did an amazing job introducing such a vast musical genre in a simplistic and thought provoking manor. The history, key players, and different "types" of jazz are all discussed in this book. I honestly could not put it down. A must read for any musician 
 This book is definitely a great one to read.  It connects to real life girls who hate their looks, and makes you remember that there are other things more important than being pretty and popular.  It also made me want  to cry at times and then in the next paragragh or so it would make me  laugh.  It was very enjoyable to read 
 (No Major Spoilers)  Relic being my first Pendergast novel of the 'series', it holds some dear memories for me.  This is a stand-alone novel, filled with mystery, some obligatory gruesome killings in the New York Museum, and some potentially fantastic characters that are merely introduced here and kept rather flat, since action is the focus of this book.  That doesn't keep certain agents and writers from being quite awesome, though, and my appreciation for them is what the book left me with, rather than the focus of the action, which I found surprising for a thriller.  My experience has been that the average thriller only has characters to advance the plot and often doesn't bother to give them a real personality.  Yet in this book, there are intruiging and endearing characters who have a life of their own outside the action, and especially in books to come.  There are some great scenes in this book and the writing, as in all Preston/Child novels, has both wit and humor embedded in both description and dialogue.  The beginning starts out slow and might deter more impatient readers, but it does build up pretty quick if you give it a chance to.  This is a beautiful book, if not just for its own sake, for the sake of the characters it's spawned for the future.  Forget the movie, which incredibly cut out the best character in the book, and give this a try if you like mystery, investigative action, sci-fi realistically presented and the potential to enter an entire world of thrills and excitement, starting from Relic and not yet at an end, seven books later 
 I ran into "Zero To One Million" threee weeks ago at one of my mother's co-workers house. I asked to borrow this book from my mother's co-worker because I am a college student very interested in entrepreneurship. After reading this book, now am inspired to network harder in the entrepreneurial communites at my university and area to find partners for my potential venture.  Ryan Allis through "Zero To One Million" provides good instruction how to lay a foundation into building a successful company. Also, Allis explains how he got his foundation of being an entrepreneur and gives pointers on how to become a successful entrepreneur. Ryan does all of this while giving a background on how entrepreneurship affects each of us individually and why it is important for our country to continue to think entrepreneurially.  "Zero To One Million" is a gem for young inspiring entrepreneurs like myself and to others who feel they may neep help with advancing the sales of their business 
 Bill Finnegan is a real journalist. He is the kind that goes to place we only read about in news briefs in a paper's international section. The kind of places we'd rather not know too much about.  In this book (more like a collection of four books) he stays stateside and tries to find out about what the future holds for the youth of America.  From poor rural farmers in the Big Piney region of east Texas to kids stuck in the violent racist/anti-racist punk rock scene of southern California, Finnegan sticks himself into the lives of his subjects, living with them for monthes at a time.  He tries and I think succeeds on gainging insight into what it is like to be raised in working class America.  The book is heavy, and can be a bit of an emotional drain but it leaves you armed with perspective 
 While the "Almighty" in the title goes against my grain given the book's freedom-loving, deist, and most human of subjects, this biography is well worth reading. Professor Davidson writes in a light style, which pays fond homage to that of this great figure of the Enlightenment.  Another good book on Voltaire came out in 2004, "Voltaire in Exile" by Ian Davidson. If you want a full life biography, go with "Voltaire Almighty". If you are mainly just interested in Voltaire's later life and work in advancing human rights, go with Mr. Davidson's worthy effort. Or, read both and compare 
 By 1971, Grand Funk Railroad already had five LP's under their belts.  In retrospect, it turns out to be the ideal point in time for compiling a live GFR album. 'Footstompin Music', which would emerge as a #29 hit several months after the music from this disc was recorded, was being previewed on the tour.  While the liner notes quote lead vocalist and guitarist Mark Farner claiming, in 2002, "The song stays the same", none of these songs will ever again be played with the verve, sincerity, and energy they possessed as newborns in 1971.  And to give you some idea of where the band was at in that epochal year, four of them are from an appearance at Shea Stadium (with Peter Frampton, Steve Marriot, and their Humble Pie co-horts doing the opening honors), and five from the Funk's backyard of Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan.  As such, we're spared some of the band's more commercial numbers ('Some Kind of Wonderful', 'Walk Like a Man' and 'Loco Motion', which charted well in 1973 and 1974), and indulged in their primitive hard-rock beginnings.  The only loss would seem to be a rendition of the band's only #1 national hit, 'We're An American Band', which premiered in 1973.  'Live - The 1971 Tour' presents a wicked cross-section of sonic obliteration that was Grand Funk Railroad's forte.  Even songs such as 'I'm Your Captain/Closer To Home' (a #22 hit in 1970) and their cover of The Rolling Stones' 'Gimme Shelter', which feature some more subtle moments in their studio incarnations, are given heavy-handed treatments here.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, and indeed in a place like Shea Stadium it may be a necessity, but by the time 'T.N.U.C.' (with it's laborious Don Brewer drum solo) and the cover of The Animals 'Inside Looking Out' roll around, you may find yourself signaling Shea's umpire for a time out.  Even the catchy chorus of the encore, 'Into the Sun' can't temper the mega-decibel onslaught.  Nearly every number on the disc features some appealing aspect, defeating the notion that GFR lacked diversity.  'Paranoid' opens with a dark, forboding texture, and plies us with a wicked wah-pedal lead from Farner.  'Hooked On Love' is actually a suite containing three distinct segments, a mid-tempo jaunt serving as the intro, a barreling up-tempo bridge, and the nearly falsetto "hooked on love!" vocal coda.  'T.N.U.C.' (a mysterious acronym to this day) is a take-no-prisoners rockfest, featuring testosterone-laden lyrics such as, "I know what you're tryin' to do... ain't gonna happen...".  'Get It Together' is mostly instrumental excepting the engaging "got to get it together" mantra as the coda.  The opener, 'Are You Ready?', is predictably every bit as fast and furious, and BRUTAL as the remainder of the disc.  The album opens with the familiar Richard Strauss composition that serves as the opening theme for the Stanley Kubrick masterpiece, '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  The music conjures up images that are both primitive and futuristic... a perfect analogy to the blend of music served up by GFR.  Like other three-man-band's of the era, such as Cream and West, Bruce and Laing, the emphasis was on the power of rock, and the recording technology of the era is just barely capable of containing the wattage being generated here.  However, with the entire tour being recorded, you can bet an abundance of quality recordings served as the pool these gems were gleened from.  The recording (glorious in full 24-bit digital remastering) comes nicely packaged with a twelve page booklet detailing GFR's career and these particular tracks, and numerous period photographs and other artifacts.  Best of all, since the disc has been picked up by BMG Direct Marketing, the price has been driven down to the $6 bare minimum.  You can't ask for much more from a musical typhoon, whose echos are still surely reverberating somewhere 
 As a parent of twin four-year-olds boys, I am grateful to have found a book that gives me straight answers, without making me feel guilty. Dr Tobin has given me a tool---the 3Rs---- that I can use anytime, anywhere with any kind of problem.  I am going to buy this book for all my expecting friends 
 I read about these three in some magazine (Essence?) while I was in a bookstore cafe. I went upstairs to browse the book and ended up buying it. I'm so glad that I went to that bookstore just to browse around or I would have never known anything about it.  I'd heard of these three from another magazine I subscribe to but never really knew what their deal was.  It was very interesting to read about three young men who grew up in the inner city projects of Newark, two of them exposed themselves to crime, all of their manhood was tested, and two went to jail/juvenile hall. But with all those pitfalls, each one of them had a personality that would not let each other fall down.  One was an activist, the next was a serious hard worker, and the third an optimistic motivator who stayed out of trouble.  These guys were so good for each other. It was interesting to read about their sides of the story in a conversational tone that showcases their down-to-Earth personalities, their mild secrets that the other two will enjoy reading, and even a couple love interests would probably be flattered too.  I think it's really cool that they gave back to their community.  My only bone to pick was that only one of them explained his first in depth experience with being a doctor and having a "situation with some blood."  I felt kinda cheated that I didn't get to hear the other two in telling about their first challenge as doctors/dentists.  I also wanted to hear Rameck's side of the rap career story. Somehow I felt like Rameck's story was still slightly closed, but either way, great book 
 When the radio played Sugar Ray's "Every Morning" at some point last June, it had been nearly two years since I'd last heard it, and that was definitely a good thing.  After over-exposure to the song in high school, my ears needed a break from it.  Pop hits tend to get overplayed, and that song was no exception.  However, after those 24 months of separation from old Sugar, I realized something: When I don't hear his songs five times a day, I actually like them.  I enjoyed listening to "Fly" in its day, and songs like "Abracadabra" had me tapping my foot to the beat as well.  For the first time, I realized that Sugar Ray's music might actually fall in my category of preference.  I figured that it was time to invest in an album, so I went to a local used CD shop, and got not one, but two Sugar Ray albums for $2.  In the process, I also learned a little something about Sugar Ray.  The albums I bought were Floored, and this self-titled one.  I just happened to listen to Floored first.  It wasn't what I expected, to say the least.  The Limp-Bizkit-inspired style and crass lyrics blasted into my brain like a bucket of ice water at 3AM.  Now, I know that some people prefer such aural punishment, and I'll admit that a few of the songs were clever, but let's just say that I wasn't prepared for the rage.  That wasn't quite the mood I'd expected the CD to emanate.  Needless to say, I was a little hesitant to put this second album into my stereo.  So I didn't.  Thankfully, I put it into my computer instead.  I was once again surprised, and this time, for the better.  I actually stopped my work to listen.  Was this the same Mark McGrath?  Enjoying the music thoroughly, I listened to the first three tracks before I returned to my work.  With the conclusion of "Under the Sun," a sense of relief came over me.  The Mark McGrath who had written the soft songs I'd come to love had not died, but lives!  But besides being refreshing, this album was just plain excellent, and I would put list it as one of my favorites.  It's one of the few CDs where I like all of the tracks, which all blend together well and flow nicely from one to the next.  The lyrics appear well thought out, and as an added bonus, the final track is one of the best songs on the album (in my opinion), ending what I would consider a great CD on a pleasant note.  So while I'm thankful that I'm no longer ignorant of Sugar Ray's history after having listened to Floored, I'm much more grateful that afterwards, I still had the bravery to try this one out.  If you're a Simple Plan or Good Charlotte fan, I have a feeling that this CD will fit right into your collection, but I'm additionally confident that a large variety of people will also enjoy it.  Sugar was meant to be sweet, not bitter.  I definitely support the band's change of style, and I hope that you will, too, and buy this album.   
 two points that have me disappointed with this item are: the color of this loveseat is actually a lot darker in person than depicted in the picture.  also, i recieved this loveseat without any of the required hardware or tools to put it together.  it was left out of the package so i had to go to the hardware store and figure out and buy my own to get this thing together.  aside from those two problems, the loveseat is actually very solid and comfortable to lounge in.  i like the nice suede-like fabric 
 I can't recommend this book highly enough. As a leadership coach in Silicon valley I often help women managers and executives to become better leaders, and this book speaks directly to two of the biggest roadblocks to women's advancement: communication and confidence. These women are shocked at how closely Mindell understands their work challenges. The book takes highly volatile, challenging workplace situations and offers suggestions that immediately actionable 
 Harville Hendricks has written an excellent book that gives couples necessary information that will strengthen their knowledge of themselves and ways to improve their marriage. It's an excellent resource for couples who can use a "shot in the arm" for their marriage as well as those whose marriage is in trouble 
 i enjoyed this book a lot.  i just spend the past five years clearing my debt of over 10k and i ordered this book after i dropped it all down to zero.  so i would've enjoyed this book moreso if i'd read it BEFORE i got my money straight.  but most of what she said in the book confirmed what i'd done on my own so it was nice to see it all in writing.  i'd reccommend it to anyone in debt problem as a starting point 
 The Biographer's Tale, from 2000, is one of those books A. S. Byatt seems to produce as a break from her "Frederica Potter" series. (I suppose one shouldn't call The Virgin in the Garden, Still Life, Babel Tower_ and The Whistling Woman the "Potter" series -- might cause confusion!) It's an enjoyable novel, fairly short, fairly amusing, with a number of surface similarities to Possession, but a very different overall feel.  Phineas G. Nanson is a very small Englishman, a graduate student in postmodern literary theory. (I say very small -- his description of himself is not specific, but I don't think he is meant to be a "dwarf" or "midget" or whatever the correct clinical term is -- rather, a very short, slight, man, perhaps 4'9" or 4'10".) One day he decides to chuck that branch of study, and a professor suggests as an alternative a study of biography, or, specifically, the three volume biography of Sir Elmer Bole, by Scholes Destry-Scholes. This biography turns out to be indeed fascinating, and Bole himself an incredible person, a Victorian polymath, who among other things married two women, a somewhat typical Englishwoman and a Turkish woman. Nanson decides to try to do a biography of Scholes Destry-Scholes. But he runs into trouble quickly -- Scholes is long dead, or at least disappeared, he isn't even really named "Scholes Destry-Scholes", and very little is known about him.  At this juncture the book seems ready to become a spiraling mystery built around curious small facts, and an elusive subject. Nanson discovers some papers left at his publishers by Scholes, that appear to be sections of contemplated biographies of other famous people, real people this time: Carl Linnaeus, Francis Galton, and Henrik Ibsen. But these prove problematic as well, as much of these accounts turn out to be invented. Nanson digs deeper, and at the same time gets a job, working at a curious travel agency run by a couple of gay men. The travel agency concentrates on unusual tours, thematically linked -- which corresponds fairly well to the inventions of Scholes re his subjects. Nanson's other diggings lead him to meet two intriguing but different women: a Swedish ecologist, or more specifically a bee expert, whom he meets at a museum dedicated to Linnaeus; and a radiologist, the niece and closest surviving relative of Scholes Destry-Scholes.  The rest of the book swings to "autobiography", as the subject becomes not Bole, or Scholes, or Linnaeus, Ibsen or Galton; but rather Nanson, in particular his relationship with the two women he has met, and his difficulties and successes at his new job. It's all pretty interesting, and fun, and generally unexpected. Some of it -- much of it -- has a distinct air of unreality. Byatt is always prone to fantastical writing even in her most mainstream stories, and here she is certainly brushing against the border of realistic fiction with -- what? I guess that's part of the question -- a question naturally posed when we consider a fictional biographer with an assumed name writing about a fictional person, but also writing about "real" people, though making up stuff about them. And so on -- consider the radiologist's art pictures -- X-rays presented as art -- are these bones the real people? Or Francis Galton's composite photographs ... or Henrik Ibsen's ideas about character ... or Linnaeus' classification schemes ... in many ways this is a "light" book but it is also an obsessively intellectual book (as usual with Byatt), and a fascinating read 
 This is a fun 80's surf movie, it sort of started the craze of surfing is cool again. There are some great shots of Hawaii's north shore and some surfing giants from the past co-staring 
  Its a small compact microwave with an attractive black finish that hides finger prints better than the white magic chef that I had before... This unit actually holds more food than it looks like it can and considering how UPS tossed it over my gated fence leaving it on my front lawn in the RAIN all day until I got home from work that night instead of leaving it at my side door like I've told UPS a hundred times to do, this little microwave has to be unbreakable...    It defrost and cooks food quick and efficently, the rotating device in the microwave is durable and stable... My only complaint would be with button placement but I'm getting used to it.. 
 this book is a collection of talks. It gave me facts about Buddism and ideas about personal growth and non-traditional, non organized religioous spirituality. the Dali Lama is one guy who has it together, period 
 Borges possesses a very universal mind, as anyone who has read him knows.  For this reason his poetry is also relatively translatable.  It contains almost every important poem, with conjectures being his most famous.  The translation provided is fairly good, although there are several instances of misjudgement, or that is my opinion anyway.  For instance, one work title El enemigo generoso (the generous enemy) is translated into english as The generous friend.  While I certainly can appreciate the irony of this translation and its potential irony, i think borges, as an incredible mind, should be left to decide these matters for himself.  Unless the cover first lists the translatorsnames.  Nonetheless Borgespoetry is overshadowed by his shortstories (Ficciones and El Aleph), and I recommend all to read this book.  Great diversity, and a very original min 
 This book is a stand out in the annals of efforts to show why trying to equalize everything ends up as a failure and a morass of crudeness and mediocrity. Unlike many conservatives who just take the secular culture and the ACLU to task this book is actually thoughtful, balanced and not trying to bring back the good old days of cardboard piety. Instead it argues for a call to excellency and standards and a renaissance of deeper, classical learning rather than a preoccupation with fads and pop psychology. It shows that if you throw every whim, every garbled nonsense and every passing crisis made personal philosophy into the same pan you don't end up with a melting pot but a politically correct wasteland without brilliance and diversity. It isn't an indictment of liberal advances rather than an outcry for forfeiting the dumbing down of the citizenry and that goes for the one track minded fundamentalists as well as the grudge bearing self-worshippers of every stripe 
 In my opinion, this cd offers a pretty good mix. I like how Johnny Vicious seperated the cds into Main Floor and Underground. While I get the feeling that not too many people like the Underground cd b/c it doesn't really have many words, it's still a pretty decent cd..it's more like something to unwind to after dancing up a storm. Main floor offers more of the popular songs you hear playing in the clubs, although Jerz-E clubs take a while to play songs like these (i.e. Forever by Dee-Dee). :( Many of these songs are repeated on other popular dance cds (like Louie DeVito's DanceFactory), but still its a good choice for a dance cd 
 New Forms won the Mercury Prize in the most abundant year in techno music history. That year being 1997. The Mercury Prize is given to the top electronica album of the year, so obviously that must mean that New Forms is one of the all-time great albums electronica has to offer right? Barely. Although disc 1 has the highlights: "Brown Paper Bag", "Let's Get It On", and "Morse Code", disc 2 maybe the best drum-and-bass cd ever recorded: a consistent onslaught of vocal-less soundscapes that keep the listener interested. Although the songs were written by Roni Size, the songs on disc 2 have an improvisatory feel to them, there's even a track called "Jazz". Disc 2 is ingenious, it is like Roni Size has a whole drum-and-bass opera in his head. But Reprazant deserves a lot of credit as well; the touches they put on every song are subtle and satisfying. "Brown Paper Bag" might be the best drum-and-bass song ever recorded and is a touchstone of tempo changes and intensity. It is truly a breathtaking ride of a song. The filler on disc 1 prevent New Forms from being an absolute masterpiece, but still recommended 
 In Media Scandals, Lull and Hinerman have completed one of the first consolidated scholarly approaches to the study of a common cultural form: the scandal. The essays utilize a variety of methodologies and produces,  from a communication perspective, a rich orientation toward scandals--how  they work, why they occur so often, what we can gain from them. For lay  audiences, this book forces us to reach beyond the good/bad  dichotomy--scandals are neither good nor bad, and perhaps not even a  reflection of the moral quality of the characters involved in them. This  book would serve as a fine textbook in a cultural studies course,  especially for its attention to the rhetorical aspects of the media scandal  form. As long as we have a commerical news media, and as long as we expect  superhuman behavior from our public figures, we will have media scandals.  This book is the right step toward trying to help us understand them 
     This latest Aerosmith is a must have for all Aerosmith fans. 
 Tolkien knows how to weave a captivating story!  You'll want to read the entire trilogy.  He sets the standard that many recent authors have tried to copy, but he is the master story-teller 
 I had to read Mosse's book for a graduate seminar on the Holocaust and found this to be absolutely fascinating. Not only does it show the progression of philosophies withing Germany from its roots in Romanticism to Volkish to what would ultimately become Nazi ideologies, but it presents the material in such a way that it becomes understandable exactly how this transition in thought could happen. Though the book is written as a scholarly history for scholars, it is fairly easy to understand, especially in the format in which it is presented. The first section focuses on the roots of Volkish thought and how they progressed from Romanticism in the late nineteenth century to Volkish in the early twentieth century which in turn lead to the Nazi ideals presented by Hitler to the German masses in the 1930s, a perversion of the Volkish. His second section examines how Volkish spread from small groups of idealists into the University system through literature and art, and through this infiltration of the Universities, as well as the German Youth Movement, expose its philosophies to a wider German audience than it had enjoyed before the first world war. The final section addresses Hitler's rise to power and the ways in which Hitler was able to manipulate Volkish and its intrinsic anti-Semitism to a radical degree to serve his purposes. Highly recommended for those interested in the Holocaust and/or Philosophy. 
 I noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3&1/2 stars and the others all had 5. I felt a need to speak up.  We bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three.  We lived in an apartment with a small back patio.  It was perfect, not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play.  He played for hours!!  Now 5 years later, his little brother loves it and my first son, almost 9, still plays with the little one in it.  It still looks brand new, nestled under the tree in our big back yard.  It's really great just smaller than the others. We have since given this for every two year old birthday present we've bought! I highly recommend it 
 This movie was Bette's best performance since "The Rose".  Definitely worth seeing and having for your DVD library.  The pain she went through when she decided she wanted to give her daughter up to a better life was just amazingly unselfish.  I would have given it a 10 if there were 10 stars!  I only wish the Divine Miss M would make more movies like this 
 This is one of my favorite childrens books.  The illustrations are fabulous and it's a story with a lesson.  When all else fails, use common sense.  I love reading this book to my grandchildren.  There is so much detail in each page it keeps their attention. AAAA 
 Artisanal cheese is cheese that has been hand-crafted in small batches according to time-honored techniques, recipes, and traditions. Domestic production of quality artisanal cheeses is on the rise. With the recent opening of the Artisanal Cheese Center in New York, more folks have the opportunity to taste and buy local and European traditional farmstead cheeses - which is wonderful!!    Max McCalman and David Gibbons, who co-authored the widely acclaimed "The Cheese Plate," have just come out with the extraordinary "Cheese: A Connoisseur's Guide to the World's Best." McCalman is renowned as one of the world's experts in artisanal cheeses. Cheese is his passion and he has dedicated himself to helping others understand and enjoy its unique pleasures. Mr. McCalman, America's first restaurant-based Maître Fromager, is also a Garde et Jure as designated by France's exclusive Guilde des Fromagers - credentials which basically mean the man knows a lot about cheese, and experts, gourmands, trust him to make choices for them! Over the past decade he established the critically acclaimed cheese program at New York City's Picholine Restaurant. I have dined there on more than one occasion and their lavish cheese cart is a wonder. When I saw this beautiful cheese encyclopedia last week, I bought a copy for myself, and one for a dear friend who I know will treasure it. This is an extremely useful guide which makes a wonderful addition to any cheese lover's library.   Approximately 200 of the world's best cheeses are included here, with information on buying, storing, tasting, and serving. Detailed notes are provided on producers, taste and appearance, stages of ripeness and seasonal availability. The main section profiles cheeses, listed and arranged alphabetically, and includes gorgeous photographs, detailed, evocative descriptions, wine parings and a numeric rating scale.     Max McCalman is also a Maître d' Hotel and Sommelier who has spent most of his career in the food and hospitality industries. He also serves as a consultant to the trade and is a lecturer and teacher at the Institute of Culinary Education, the Culinary Institute of America, New York University, the DeGustibus Chef's Tasting Series, and The New School. He has been featured on the Television Food Network, the CBS Evening News, the Cable News Network, and Martha Stewart Living Television.   Highly recommended! ENJOY! JAN 
 The Steve Miller Band really dominated the '70s with their rock songs. They are surprisingly catchy, especially the landmark Fly Like An Eagle, which has a cool groove, yet rocks also! Countless rap artists have sampled this song and Seal did a wonderful remake of the song in 1996. But songs like The Joker, the catchy Swingtown that Ford used in their car commercials once, Jet Airliner, the country-tinged Dance Dance Dance, Threshold (the lead-in intro to Jet Airliner--most stations still play both songs at once, a rare and chance taking move), Jungle Love (which Malcolm In the Middle used in their commercial once), and countless others. Miller didn't want to do this project at first, but he could not believe the contribution that his band brought to American music in the '70s. His phenomenal guitar playing dominates the songs and his band had one of the best rhythm sections in rock bands. This is a dynamic release that you'll want to play over and over again! Probably inspired many artists to put out greatest hits albums when their careers were running dry of hits--his band had the right formula to making one rather than what the record company thinks 
 I saw this play done by a small group of high school students the past year and it is perhaps one of the best plays I've ever seen. Edward Albee has mastered the art of Absurdest 
 I read this among a few other books, well worth reading.  here are the pros and cons.  Pros: - written based on a real life story - Reader friendly and you'll definetly understand it  Cons:  - lays down a few techniques but don't expect much - not so much about technical analysis, charting or indicators - author tends to be brief sometimes and limited info is given  If you are new to trading, read it and do so only if you will read a few other books on technical analysis and charting as well as fundamentals. A bit expensive for its listed price of $60 but you can get at amazon for much less, especially since it's a small book.  remeber there is a lot to this game "trading" so educate yourself before you put your $$$ on the line and remember  " The trend is your friend except at the end" good luck and happy trading 
 A must have book for any Thomas the Tank Engine fa 
 Really nice black and white photos.  i bought the book for the Mark harmon photo "Mark Harmon 7.33".  I would have liked some smaller shots of other pictures that were taken during the shoots for the book on each page, maybe to see what was rejected 
 I started watching this movie by pure chance on local TV station when I had nothing better to do. And then I just couldn't stop. Brilliant movie but definitely not for everyone. This is not your ordinary thriller or drama, it's a surreal movie about obsession and loss as many others have stated. You'll probably like this if you liked weird movies such as Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, certain Wim Wenders movies etc.   I keep thinking about this movie from time to time, so now I'm off to order a DVD 
 This is the first volume of two covering the life and works of Charles Darwin.  I have read quite a number of books, both about and by Darwin, and this, without a doubt is the best of the biograhies as yet written to date.  If covers Darwin from the beginning, up through the voyage of the Beagle, and a bit beyond.  Extremely detailed and very well researched, the books reads as smoothly as any novel, yet it is truely a scholarly work.  It is one of the most detailed works of this sort I have read.  I read a review recently in a trade publication that stated you will go into absolute information overload with this one.  That is not far from the truth.  As to detailed research, the closest I can think of, off the top of my head, is Dallek's work on LBJ...even that does not come all that close.  Ms. Brown's style is wonderful, her thoughts well laid out.  The belief in evolution is neither here nor there when reading this work.  While it does indeed deal with his life work, i.e. "The Orgin of Species," it gives us more insight to the man, rather than the theory. Whether or not you are an evolutionist or creationist is moot.  Darwin's impact on our society and the way we view the world was changed with this man and we should know him and the society that created him.  To understand our current history, an understanding of this man and his times is absolutely necessary. I collect books about Charles Darwin, and this one now sets at the head of my "Darwin Shelf."  I highly recommend it and highly recommend you add it to your collection. 
 I didn't go into this liking baseball but I couldn't help but appreciate the game and its place in US history when finished.  I have used lots of clips from the series in class and students have enjoyed it and asked for more. I had to study more baseball history details afterwards because it really sparked my interest. Great Film!!!! Ken burns at his best.  
 in 1987, before I accidentaly borrowed this album from a friend, I never an idea about rock or metal,  but this great album changed my music taste completely.. 
 Another delightful mystery by Lilian Jackson Braun...Qwilleran is able to solve the mystery with the help of Koko, his Siamese cat. A famous rare bookstore located in Pick Ax unexpectedly burns to the ground and the owner is killed. Although he always joked about it, the owner leaves the bookstore to Qwilleran in his will. Qwilleran is thoroughly surprised and plans to build a memorial to him in the town library. Throughout the story, Qwilleran cannot believe that the fire was an accident. Koko confirms his suspicions by leaving a  series of cat-like clues. Koko eventually leads him to the suspect after he smells-out the biggest clue.  
 Lots of F-86 air combat video and a good cast 
 Exploring the issues that captivate the minds of men, really! ... easy and good reading from a pastor, with examples taken from his own life .. very honest and revealing -- I've read it and I've recommended it to several  other men, who have also enjoyed it. It was a good way to open up to each  other and really start discussing what really is on our minds 
 You probably never heard of "Elmer and the Dragon" and yet the story is a classic that belongs in every child's library.  What fun it was reading  aloud!  There are three books to the series that are connected but stand alone.  See also "My Father's Dragon" and "The Dragons of Blueland" for a set that makes a perfect gift for young readers 
 Barbara does a great job of pulling together a wide variety of soups that have never failed me from the simple country tomato, to the hearty beef stew to the hot and sour or the exotic Tom Ka Coconut Soup. The backstories and the basics lend to its completeness and character. This will be a staple in my cookbook library for life 
 Dao Te Ching (Dao De Jing) is such a good book. I consider this is one of the best three books I have studied.  The first two statements can be alternatively translated as:  The state can be stated is not the normal state. The name can be named is not the normal name.  
 I am a big fan of Ewan McGregor and have seen most of his movies.  I was hesitant to get this movie because the idea of money, trading, etc. seemed foreign and out of my league.  You DO NOT have to know anything about trading to get into this movie.  Ewan McGregor gives one of his best performances.  You actually feel extremely nervous and uncomfortable as he gets himself deeper and deeper into trouble. You kind of feel like you're going to get in trouble for just watching!  Great movie if you love suspense and a "must own" for any Ewan fan 
 When I first saw/heard The Jazz  Crusaders at a club in Houston in the late '70's they blew me out of my seat. And this CD had me reaching for my seat belt again. What a delight to hear free wheeling, swinging, bluey jazz from these guys at their rollicking best. Five stars to all. Wilton Felder's sax is gutsy, earthy, swinging and always honest. Wayne Henderson proves a trombone can swing and be smooth. Stix Hooper gives a lesson on how to drive a group and still stay out of everyone's way. Absolutely tasty drum work. His simply riding a cymbal is something to behold. And of course, Joe Sample it in top form on this CD. If you appreciate jazz solos that are inventive, creative and "go somewhere and then come back" this CD for you. No mindless noodling from these guys. Jazz like it was meant to be played 
 I am actually reviewing both Parts One and Two with this since they should be read together.The reason why I enjoyed these plays so much is because we see Falstaff in both of them.  He is my favourite Shakespearean character - big, bawdy, rough, a liar and a cheat, but again we know what he is right from the beginning, and Shakespeare keeps him so true to character.  These plays are a bit different from some of the other histories.  There are more comedic parts in them for one thing.  The plays are certainly used as a medium for introducing young Hal (who will become King Henry V).  We see him as a young man, and watch him grow and see the influences that his society and the people in it have on his development.  He doesn't appear to be growing up well according to his father because he is so irresponsible.  King Henry IV was not England's strongest ruler.  He was haunted by his guilt over the death of his predecessor, King Richard II.  In Part Two, comedy still plays a big role, and we still see Falstaff's influence on young Hal until the shocking moment of Falstaff's death.  The best part about Part Two though is the deathbed scene between old King Henry IV and his son Prince Henry.  The play leads us to "King Henry V".  Prince Hal does finally grow up and he becomes a very strong leader.  Actually King Henry Iv, Parts one and two should be read before King Henry V.  It is the correct sequence and we see Prince Hal grow and mature.       
 When I read this book (a personally autographed large-softcover version) I loved the funny parts, couldn't stop reading to eat my lunch through the exciting guide-building parts, and spent far too much time thinking and rethinking through the concepts of multiple dimensions that were rather frighteningly well created by the author.  The logical updates from the onset of newer technology by the time the author wrote this book work very well... his descriptions of computers and programming fit in charmingly well with the earlier books' general avoidance of such topics, leaving us to feel like it all works out well without any needed corrections to older technology flops introduced in the 1st book.  Random is great - very believable, I think I might have known her actually.  The Grebulons are perfect and did bring a smile to my face what with having lost their minds.  Trishia McMillan frustrated me with her inability to get good believable footage of the Grebulons - I can imagine this situation being quite possible.  The new guide is excellent - although you must read between the lines a bit to understand much of the concepts the author is presenting.  If you can think outside of the box then you will understand this book - if not, please don't bother.  It's not written for you I'm afraid.  Unless your box has infinitely long sides and one side is inside out... if that is the case then this book is most definitely right for you.  The ending simply floored me.  I was shocked, horrified, and quite upset about it for days to come.  In fact I listed to the author's reading of the entire 5 book series over the past couple of weeks on my 3 hour/day commute and found Mostly Harmless to be surpassed only by the first book in excitement, creativity and enjoyability, while truly causing shock and bewilderment.  The fact that this is the last book in the series for the rest of eternity is perfect.  Much as the author shouldn't have died unexpectedly, neither should the entities in the book have come to such a true, complete, end after their long circular ride through time and space.  However that's how life works and this whole situation just proves that the author was right about infinite improbability.    The odds against the trilogy of books and the author's life both ending so abruptly must be 2,312,495 to 1 against.. 
 This review is from personal experience.  I recently picked up a D200 to replace my D70.  This past weekend I took the photos for my sister's wedding.  I shot with full functionality using LCD review for every shot and was using the Nikon 18-200 VR lens.  Over the course of the wedding and reception I took 295 photos in Fine JPEG mode and reviewed them while shooting.  At the end of the afternoon, I still had battery life left and very likely could have taken 100 more photos.  Given the features and capability of the D200, I have absolutely no issue with that many photos.  I will pick up a second battery for a back up as soon as someone has some in stock.  And I could not agree more with the previous reviewer.  If you do not have personal experience with this product, there is no need to attempt to review it based on hearsay or something you might have read elsewhere 
  Leave it to high school English teachers, those frequent crushers of dreaming souls, to find a way to put young minds off this steamroller of a poetry collection. No rhymes to bore anyone, no meter, simply a transfer of pure mental energy. It took me a while to get into Whitman because I knew him thru a lot of boring teachers who tried to squeeze the very life out of these works and inject them with artificial, completely sanitized "meaning". This is poetry at its most raw. It does for the written word what Stravinsky did with music. It doesn't need dressing up and it utterly rejects the falsity of good manners. As Whitman joyfully tells us of himself: "I am not the least bit civilized!" This is wild stuff and it'll kick you sideways if you give it half a chance. Read it and then choose the right moment to sound your own barbaric yawp 
 This novel was heartbreaking, uplifting, enraging, and empowering. I read Mrs. Dalloway in college and couldn't quite yet grasp what was being said. I read this novel as a desparate housewife of a sort, and wept. I wept for myself, for women through otu the ages. I wept for my dying spirit, and in that realization I was able to find myself again. I suspect many women have had the same reaction. In subsequent readings I've found there are some problems with the plot development, but this novel is so beautiful and so poignant that it doesn't matter 
 I am an adoptee searching for my birth family and an adoptive mother of a 5 year old.  Sherrie's book went right to my heart and soul.  She is making me life outside my box and get involved in adoption issues.  I am writing a article for the agency I used to adopt my child, volunteering for camp, and getting the adoption issue message out thanks to Sherrie's Book.  Can't wait to get her other book and read it.  Keep writing to all who are touched by adoption, which I believe is a huge percentage of our population.  Our children are our greatest resourse and the future.  And to the reviewers who are offended by the religious messages, get a life.  God Created us all with a divine plan in mind and this is part of growing and living with adoption.  Thanks Serrie and keep writing for us all.  We need any and all things related to adoption for our families.  Bobbi Humphreys Herrick Arvada, CO USA

 good but could have been better  check out tys "The Music Business: How You Can Make $500,000.00 (or More) a Year in the Music Industry by Doing It Yourself! Volume II  
 Our son was excited to get this toy.  The only problem is that the toy doesn't do anything.  It appears that it is made to be magnetic, so that the boulders stick to the construction equipment.  However, this is not the case.  The boulders fall off of the trucks and serve no purpose.  Would be a lot more fun if they could stick to the trucks 
 Not a bad CD. Nice & Mellow to listen to, great for those rainy days or spending time with your sweetie 
 This is a great book for fans of Hellblazer - that's Hellblazer the Comic book. Forget all about that movie and harken back to Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis, back when folks were doing something with this character. John Shirley is a visceral writer who's prose is sharp and exacting, he tells a great romp of a story that leads J.C. thru a very current tale of war and horror. The reviewers that are bent on trashing this book seem to be  sychophanticlly dogmatic about their own misguided perceptions of the character. This novel would have made an excellent story-arc in the comic itself. It's a great read. Enjoy it 
 As other reviewers have pointed out, there are a number of excellent biographies out there covering the life of General Patton.  This short work though, does a wonderful job of compacting a very large amount of informaton into a short, readable biography.  The author is quite concise and the material very well organized.  For those readers not wanting to delve into a 1000 plus page work, yet are interested in this great generals life, this quite fills the bill.  The technical aspect of war is kept to a minimum, yet the author is able to convey the complexities of war quite well as well as the complexities of George S. Patton.  I do hope the rest of the books in this series are as well done.  Overall, recommend this one highly. 
 Richard Conniff's writing style is fun and easy to read.  And although some of the facts he pours into the book may be gross, it's so interesting you are riveted.  I think everyone-science lover or no-needs to read this book.  I couldn't put the book down until I was done.  Just to give you some extra info on what's in the book-he discusses many invertebrates such as flies, hagfish, moths and tarantulas, devoting a chapter to each invertebrate.  He includes his adventures with these creatures along with it.  Even the hardened scientist will find something new in this book 
 I'm A homeschooling mom, and I found alot of good information in this book. It covers principles of home education, areas of learning, theory into practice, resource information,and forms for keeping records. This book will show how to set up a wonderful christian learning environment for your child,and how to find materials and help, to make your home school succeed 
 I had to buy this book for my Quantity Foods course as a part of my Dietetics major. I actually liked the book, and I am going to keep it for later use. I thought the book was organized very well. Some of the charts in Chapter 2 and 5 that we used quite often were a little hard to find (because there are so many!).  It also presented a good overview of things you wouldn't think would be in the book, such as the school lunch program, etc.  I liked it 
 Great book! I enjoyed reading about a man who literally came from poverty  to be on of Hollywood's pioneer filmmakers. He was a rough man to work with  no doubt, but knew what worked and lasted in an industry that is hard to  last in! A. Scott Berg did a wonderful job of writing a respectful book  about this man 
 Wonderful comedy, Laurl and Hardy remain some of the best ever. Because these films were made in the 30's and 40's they don't have all the special effects that are used in films today, and of course their in black & white. None of this takes away from these films, the sure genius of Laurl and Hardy make these films worth watching. Unlike so many of the so-called comedies of today I find myself laughing continuely throughout these films. L&H are also able to create these great films without the use of profanity, sex, or violence. This DVD contains a very good selection of some of L&H's best films. A very good job was done digitally remastering these classics and I for one, am very glad that they have been preserved in this format. Some people may feel that these films are for older people to reminisce about the "good old times" but I would reccommend this DVD to all ages. 
 Works great with my HP OfficeJet 551 
 Nowadays Demons might be looked upon as merely an Italian cinematic curio or maybe just a typical - even derivative - example of the horror flicks that saturated the 1980s. But when it was first released in 1986, Demons upped the ante in the genre of the macabre, in terms of shock and gore. Unlike the slow zombies of George Romero's, these creatures were quick, but just as relentless. The sheer abandonment with which the demons went after their prey was stupefying to watch for a teenager like I was. There was an atmosphere of impending doom that was palpable throughout the film. I just saw Demons again for the first time in almost a decade, and while it's lost a bit of its luster for me, I still found it vastly entertaining. In my viewing of horror flicks, I don't look for detailed explanations, just a modicum of logic in an illogical genre. This film fits the bill. Demons is a mishmash of cheesy exposition, stilted acting, moist and  grisly demonic transformations, and prerequisite monster chases and graphic disfigurements. Not too shabby. In fact, it's the perfect dvd to throw in when you have sarcastic friends over.      The skimpy plot goes something like this: Complimentary tickets for a film screening are being passed out by a sinister man sporting a metallic half mask. Cut then to the dilapidated movie palace The Metropol and its smattering of movie goers. The screening begins and the movie being shown turns out to be  a creepy horror flick about demons being raised and overrunning the world. As the movie unreels, scenes in the picture begin to parallel the goings-on in the audience. Soon enough, demons are ravaging and rending their frantic victims both on the screen and in the panic-filled theatre, which instantly becomes an abattoir.  As I've said, in a by-the-number gorefest such as this, I tend to tolerate quite a bit. However, I do think the dead-end subplot of the coke-snorting hooligans who come in late to the picture is unnecessary. But it's a minor quibble. Demons  was the first collaboration between director Lamberto Bava and producer Dario Argento, and their combined expertise in the genre turns Demons into a slick, sanguinary monster classic, laden with moments of sheer blood and guts carnage. The professionally-done monster effects, while not up to snuff with our current CGI stuff, were state of the art back then. The hard rock/heavy metal soundtrack also adds to the effluvium of menace and immediacy. For a horrificly good time, this film is wildly  recommended!    By the way, the special features offer a pretty interesting film audio commentary done in part by director Lamberto Bava, who speaks in both English and Italian. There's also a behind-the-scenes segment and a theatrical trailer 
 This is a fun picture book for very young children.  Children are encouraged to identify the fish that has left its fishbowl in various colorful environments, e.g., in a pot of flowers, in a jar of candies, in a room of toys.  It's cute and will be entertaining for the youngest of children 
 As an avid disciple of strategy and leadership, I find this book a valuable companion to Porter and Sun Tzu.  Unlike many CI books which dwells heavily on the "tricks of the trade" and  "checklists", Liam Fahey's work provides the reader a set of  conceptual frameworks for appraoching the whole CI process.  This leads to  a better understanding of the competitive environment, its dynamics and  opportunities to win.   Mr Fahey's thoughts would make a great MBA course.   But until then, this book gives the reader a first-mover advantage over  those who are still in the dark ages of strategy and competitiveness 
 I loved this book. I think it is my all time favorite, though I need to give it more time to sink in.  In this review I would rather talk about an issue that deeply confused me when reading this book: there are two versions out.  My first copy, which I purchased new at a Barnes and Noble had 351 pages, my second copy had exactly 400. The difference is a chapter called "An Interruption" narrated by one of the characters, which was about 50 pages long, and goes from page 250 to 300. Many say that this passage severely alters the story, but I believe it is really just affirming that the book is fiction, and making a joke about the connections people make with the book and his personal life. I don't want to say any more because I don't want to spoil it however, I feel that it is not really an important passage either way.  This was especially confusing to me because I believed that all paperbacks had the alteration, however, they don't. Both say "Vintage Books First Edition July 2003" and both books contain a note that the text was altered from the original version; however both do not contain the interruption.  I do not know which version Amazon.com is selling as it claims the book has 368 pages while that number differs from both of my copies.  Either way this is a great book. I read it first without the interruption, and I think it may read best if you skip it, then read it at the end, as another Amazon reviewer suggested. It almost seems as if the tone of that part expects you to have read the whole story. However, it is not my place to question the work of a genius like Eggers so maybe we should read it the way he (eventually) intended. 
 Both of my kids reach for this, and some of the other DK books in this series, over and over and over. They love them. I believe these books have helped develop their language skills more than any other books 
 Not slick and glossy like the movie, which only covers a small amount of material from the book and that's been 'retooled' for Hollywood. This is a book of historical fact, not a novel written along a movie plotline. Still, it's good stuff, especially if you're from NYC, or care about the sociology of the 19th century. The author has another book of New Yorker magazine articles on the same topic (All Around The Town), compiled a few years after "Gangs". The All Around the Town stories have a more elegant, accessible structure, are more entertainingly readable than "Gangs", still "Gangs" is worth reading for the information I never learned in school while growing up in NYC 
 I wanted to buy this cause i watched it a few times and never finished it so i looked and it shows the COMPLETE COLLECTION for only $44 so boohaa but when i got my dvd it only is the 1st complete collection which was the bummer. it shows in the picture its complete and it also says it has 7 dvds which only has 4 so if you want this just cause its cheaper then be my guest but if you want to get the complete collection this aint it. 
 A must for any Suede fan because of the remixes that are available only on this cd. Not to mention Everything Will Flow is about the most beautiful Suede song since Wild Ones or By The Sea. Brett's vocals are as always gorgeous. Not only will Britpop fans enjoy this cd but club kids as well 
 This book is not as good as some of Grafton's other books but still has the same type of quality that she exhibits in all of her books.  In this one, Kinsey is asked to follow up a deceased PI in solving a 6-year old murder 
 Despite the title, this book is about understanding how to help people envision your ideas and thoughts.  There are many good concrete examples that illustrate methods for guiding conversations in a positive productive way for both parties.  Implementing the lessons taught in this book has improved my business and personal relationships.  I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to build his "people skills." 
  Henry is a man that suffers from Chrono-Displacement Disorder where he finds himself thrown to different times in his life as if the gravity pulls him to the past then the future with no apparent reason.   The time traveling experience centers on Henry and Clare's relationship. You see their struggle to live a normal life and their unending love for each other. It is a heartwarming story of remembrance.   Be prepared to laugh and cry when you read this touching love story.   
 The Dance Hall of the Dead is a well written novel that blends fiction with nonfiction.  The story mainly takes place in and around the Zuni reservation in New Mexico.  The story is intertwined with Zuni culture and presents references to Navajo and Archaic culture.  I am not very familiar with the Zuni culture, so i do not know how accurate his cultural references are.  I found this book to be an easy and fun read.  Although a little slow at first, the story builds on unanswered questions that will have you second guessing until the very end. Anyone interested in the Zuni, archaeology, or that enjoys a mystery/thriller should give this book a try 
 Anyone who has kids (I have four under who are 6 and younger) knows that parents don't have a lot of time to spend reading wordy explanations on how to do things.  For that reason, I loved this book when it was given to me and my wife as a gift when our first was born.    In about 30 mins or less I could see what I was doing/not doing right in order to "dial in" the right shots.  My father, who was a professional writer and photographer, has since regularly given me compliments on my photography of the children.   The only possible drawback to this book is it has probably helped lead to my taking more pictures than I can easily manage.  But at least there won't be a shortage of memories--and ones that look pretty good to boot 
 How I became Hettie Jones is one of the most candid and lovely books I have ever read. I am a fan of Amiri Baraka and I have done a lot of research on him so naturally this book would have been an inside look into  his life. Hettie Jones exhibits extreme courage and inner beauty in her  prose. I fell in love with her spirit as i read the book. Any woman, black  or white will be able to identify with the trials Jones ovecomes. I like  Jones because she doesn't compromise herself and loves who she is, flaws  and everything. Her artful language places the reader into each time frame,  making them become a part of each situation. I would recommend this book to  everyone who would appriciate the wise words of an open-minded, creative  and intelligent woman 
 The more I read about Lincoln the more I realize what an incredibly extrodinary man he was. No one book can cover all of the complex person Lincoln was, nor of all that went on while he was alive.  What this book does is paint a very complex picture of the man and his life. Every page is very well written and very informative. You just can't put this down.  One of the best books, not just about Lincoln, but also about the Civil War 
 I haven't seen this movie and I've never heard of it. The cover makes it look so interesting that I can't wait to see it. I highly recommend this movie to everybody 
 En 1983, Queen pasaba por un mal momento, con el fracaso de "Hot space", y el decaimiento definitivo en Estados Unidos, tanto por fans con por criticas especializadas. Sin embargo, Queen vuelve a la gloria, principalmente en Europa y America (excepto E.E.U.U.) con este magnifico album que fue "The Works". Temas como "Radio ga-ga", "I want to break free" e "It's a hard life" fueron grandes exitos del grupo. Otros como "Hammer to fall", "Tear it up" y "Is this the world we created" son temas totalmente inolvidables para los que conocemos a Queen. Otros como "Keep passing the open windows" y "Machines", temas menores pero no dejan de ser interesantes. Tal vez el unico punto bajo sea "Man on the prowl" ya que es una copia innecesaria de "Crazy little thing called love". Pero de todas maneras, un gran disco, gran regreso despues del traspie de "Hot space", tal vez algo menor que algunos discos historicos.  En la edicion de Hollywood Records, viene como bonus track, el tema "I go crazy", tema muy rockero y potente, que deberi?a haber estado sin duda en la edicion original 
 Parade's End is a large, multifaceted creation -- the sort of book that, while difficult at times to chew, grows in your estimation after some digestion. At the broadest level it is the story a man's passive resistance to social change, but such a summary doesn't do justice to a complex and often surprising work. It is also about control -- Christopher Tietjens and his wife Sylvia control each other in a deadlock that threatens mutual destruction, but neither will let go. Look for variations on the "control" theme ranging from military command decisions, to a man's paralysis to an unruly horse.  My one criticism of Ford, in fact, is that often far from subtle with his themes. In "No More Parades," for example, the phrase "there will be no more parades" becomes a refrain to the point where you want to cry out "Enough! I get the point!"  This critcism aside, I recommend Parade's End to any reader, and would offer the following advice: First, treat it as one novel; don't think you can set it aside for months between titles. Second, though Christopher Tietjens is the primary character, there are other characters such as his brother Mark who are much more than just supporting cast, even though they may disappear for hundreds of pages at a time. Don't overlook their development and how they react to the changing world 
 I found this book to be very helpful and complete. The humor and affection that the author shows for the area and kids in general was very welcome departure from the otherwise stuffy travel guides I'm used to reading. I found her insights about timing visits, local restaurants to check out, and walking tours to be very handy. Reading her guide was like getting advice from a helpful Mom. It's sold me on the Frommer Kids series, and I'm looking forward to using them on my next trip 
 This was my first digital camera that I have ever bought, and I am completely satisfied with it. Talk abt the resolution or the camera's feature. All of it is packed into one small sleek camera. I recommend this digital camera to everybody. And I would say if I would decided later in future to get another one. I would alwayz go for Canon. They are the best in making Digital Cameras 
 This is incredile writing, Masters ability to give his characters a voice that reachs ones heart and mind simply amazing. Ernest Hyde, is an excellent example of this as well as Amanda Barker,Yee Bow and many others. These are the names of some the voices that Masters sets free. There dry innocent voices are oddly humorous and this is what i find the most refreshing.This is free verse at its finest. 
 This was the second Tarzan novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  It picks up right where the first Tarzan book left off.  Jane is engaged to Tarzan's cousin and Tarzan is sailing back to Europe.  Will Tarzan and Jane end up together?  Of course, but there will be many obstacles before they get there.  This is a solid adventure novel, which fans of old time pulp fiction will enjoy

 A thriller that takes place underground. Visuals crop up from the movie as you read through this novel. Well written. The ending here is slightly anti-climatic as compared to the movie but still a gem 
 I have not try Proactive. The thought of buying something from an infomercial just doesn't sit well with me.  I, however, have tried many many products since my 20s till now (I'm 35). I spent thousands of dollars on expense department store's brands like Clarins, Seshiedo, Dior, Clinics, Chanel, and Prescriptives. I've also religiously go to my derma every three weeks for the past ten years to have facials, extractions, and chemical peels.  I tried perscription cream, oitments, pads, you name it (even thought of laser).  I have mild acne problem year round, and it only gets worst during that time of the month (that's when I'd run out and try new products).  Three days ago I bought the Zeno.  I'm going to return it.  It did nothing to me accept thought it would burn me.  I also bought AcneFree and today I went back and bought another package to put in my gym bag.  Three days now, I've noticed my skin cleared up! I'm amazed.  I'm not giving it a 5 star because my skin is not completely cleared.  I'll give it a try two more weeks and will update my rating if it improve.  So far AcneFree works for me 
 It was finally in 1998, that the Candian band Barenaked Ladies released their breakthrough record: STUNT. They caught the public's, radio's, and movie soundtrack industries' ears. The band was continuing their performance of light Pop/Rock with a slight Swing feel. Their sound was umistakenly what the public wanted to hear. Even artist "Weird Al" Yankovic did a parody of Barenaked Ladies' "One Week", and the song also landed itself a spot as part of the soundtrack to the film 10 Things I Hate About You. The track "It's All Been Done" landed a soundtrack spot for the film "Drive Me Crazy". All of the tracks rock and over all this is a very good record. It is easy to hear why Barenaked Ladies finally hit it big with this album 
 The synopsis ... Sam and Jonah Baldwin, father and son, have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer.  Seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of Chicago, they move to Seattle.  Eighteen months later, Jonah can sense that his dad is still sad; and, in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help guru on Christmas Eve to wish for his father a new wife.  Annie Reed lives in Baltimore and is engaged to Walter.  Their relationship, while loving and comfortable, is entirely devoid of romantic sparks.  When Annie hears Jonah's soulful plea on the radio, it's as if her heart has been touched by "magic" and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to Sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across "like 26 states".  The critique ... Sleepless in Seattle is a brilliantly simple film; that's what makes it so great.  To quote Nora Ephron, "It isn't a movie about love, it's a movie about love in the movies."  To emphasize this point, she incorporates various parallel references to "An Affair to Remember" throughout the film; but, Sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love (which, let's admit it, have been undeniably shaped by what we've seen on the silver screen).  The script is refreshingly candid, yet endearing and Nora Ephron's direction is impeccable.  Ross Malinger, cast as Jonah Baldwin, is the youngest and most notable talent in the film.  He does an excellent job of portraying THE quintessential eight-year-old; he's impulsive, moody and thinks he knows it all.  (I speak from experience here folks; I currently have a son that age.)  He and Tom Hanks come together flawlessly as father and son; so successfully in fact, that they would be utterly convincing off screen.  The chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks is equally amazing, which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene.  The supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes Rosie O'Donnell, Bill Pullman, Rita Wilson, Rob Reiner, David Hyde Pierce, and a young Gaby Hoffmann.  Families with younger children will appreciate the film's integrity; there is very little foul language ("God damn it" and " ... it scared the shit out of me ..." being the worst of it) and no "sexual content" to be wary of.  All around, this is a winning film.  One that I find myself watching over and over and over again.  The DVD ... For a 10th Anniversary Edition, the special features are few and rather disappointing.  You've got your basic director commentary, a music video ("When I Fall in Love" by Celine Dion & Clive Griffin), and a "Love in the Movies" Featurette.  This last piece is approximately 15 minutes long.  It features the director, producers,	actors and the hosts of Loveline: Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla (why they are included, I don't know) talking about "Love in the Movies."  There are some interesting interview segments with an Empire State Building Historian and some very beautiful shots of the New York skyline before 9/11; but there's certainly nothing here to write home about.  By far, the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio.  (And honestly, how exciting is that?)  This a DVD that you buy for the film alone.        
 I came across "Caddie Woodlawn" as I was making my way through all the old Newbery books.  I was pleasantly surprised at the gentle style of storytelling, and the author's knack for telling a good tale.  The book reminds me a lot of the Laura Ingalls Wilder series both in style and content.  The author is writing a semi-biographical account of her grandmother's life in the end of the 19th century on the midwestern frontier.  There are a few tales within the tale that are interesting as well.  The reader will not be disappointed.  It is definitely a must have for the young adult library 
 Whether you buy the original "A Christmas Album" or the new "James Taylor at Christmas" this is easily one of the best Christmas CD's you can find. 11 of the songs were produced by Dave Grusin, an accomplished composer and performing artist himself, "A Christmas Album" also features Natalie Cole, Chris Botti, John Pizzarelli and Mr. Grusin as collaborators.  The songs are as enchanting as they are laid-back. There are gorgeous pop-jazz versions of "Winter Wonderland," "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" and "The Christmas Song". There is also an engagingly simple new-age flavored version of "Auld Lang Syne", an Elizabethan flavored version of "Deck the Halls" (on the original ACA and on the special edition of JTAC) and a funk-blues version of "Jingle Bells". Dave Grusin and James Taylor make great partners, particularly on the gospel song "Go Tell It on the Mountain". While I like everything on this album, three songs stand out the most for me; the straightforward and graceful interpretations of "In the Bleak Midwinter" and "Some Children See Him" and the tropical-flavored cover of "Baby, It's Cold Outside". This duet with Natalie Cole is easily one of the best versions, right up there with Louis Armstrong & Velma Middleton's and Ray Charles & Betty Carter's.  "James Taylor at Christmas" includes the breathtakingly simple and beautiful cover of Joni's Mitchell's "River", produced by James Taylor and Charlie Paakkari, which manages to be sad and hopeful at the same time.  The same can also be said about "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," produced by Russ Titelman and originally recorded for the album "October Road". JT subtly brings out the pathos in the song without losing its essential optimism.  There's a reason this music has proven so popular in any version, these performances are just so good, you can enjoy listening to them over and over, even after the Christmas Season is over 
 I've seen the movie and now have had the chance to read the book. Recommended, done in Grisham style 
 Vasari's LIVES has lived for over 450 years, and it's easy to see why! From Cimabue to Titian, he covers (in this edition)over 40 artists during about a 250 year period! A great artist himself, Vasari spares no superlatives in describing the work and lives of these individuals.They are just about all "most excellent", and produced titanic painting, sculpture, and architecture. He claims (erroneouly, according to the editors) that one murdered his rival, and definitely was not a nice guy. But the rest are generally given the royal treatment. Oddly,Botticelli seems a tad slighted. The Big Three, Leonardo,Raphael, and Michaelangelo are practically bathed in the light of the devine!.Many anecdotes are mentioned, which give real life and sometimes fun to these Olympians. Plus, discussions of the progress and styles/ techniques which come full flower with these Big Three. 
 why are the xfiles so much money every one says... well lets see first off , every single show is reformated into wide screen mode making it cleaner and much more clear then you would see on tv , it also includes every single episode which is pretty much an hour per each show meaning there are like 20 hours a season , its like saying why are the sapranos seasons costs so much?  you pay to get great tv shows on dvd , if you don't want to pay the price they don't buy it , these dvds are for true fans only and who don't mind paying the price to get them 
 The Go Gos would have to be one of my favourite bands of the 1980's. This CD contains the unforgettable track "Alex The Seal". The last I heard Alex was performing at Waterworld in Florida. Belinda and the Go Gos Rock 
 Gogol's Dead Souls is a russian classic dark comedy of epic proportions.  Warmly recommended.  
 It's about the man who invented the sea clock thing and another guy trying to fix the original one. Good and edu. 
 Like so many chart toppers, Sheryl Crow came out with a great debut album.  She seperated herself from the rest by contiunually putting out solid albums.  However, I still believe her first album is her best and I don't believe she's had a bad album to date.  I bought this CD when it came out and here it is Fall 2005 and it is currently in my CD player as I write this; a timeless album you will not tire in listening to 
 Berkner manages to deliver a CD that I like to listen to even when my son isn't in the car with me.  The music is a mix of styles and tempos and there's not a dud in the bunch 
 The great thing about this movie is just how believable it is. Some people I have shown it to actually thought that Eddie and Cruisers were a real band and that the movie was a docudrama. The characters have faults and failings and are believable, the plot is classic rock'n'roll mythology, the music is original (mostly) and great.   John Cafferty and The Beaver Brown Band provide the real voice of Eddie Wilson and these guys can really rock. This soundtrack rates in my top 50 favorite albums to this day.  "What I want is songs that echo" says Eddie, and oh and they do. Both score and movie are still fresh and relevent today.  The only Rock'n'Roll movie I like better is Eddie Lives! (out now) together they tell one of the best R'n'R myths ever. Get both NOW! 
 Over the past year, I have purchased a number of professional resources on the topic of literacy instruction, including more well-known books by Patricia Cunningham, Fountas and Pinnell and Tony Stead. This book is the one I turn to most often for straight-forward, research-based information and guidance. Although I'm uncertain as to whether or not it is a requisite resource for teachers in training, I wouldn't be at all surprised if it were a staple in universities and colleges. It's not the "lightest" read at times, but it's concise, clear and offers exactly what the title promises 
 This isn't a book of poetry, it is a book of one poem, beautifully matched with work by Matisse.  I have now given it to two different couples for their weddings.  Words and pictures to make your heart soar, Cohen and Matisse seemed to be talking to each other with their art 
 As a mystery author with my first novel in initial release, I genuinely admire the works of Lindsey Davis.  In ONE VIRGIN TOO MANY, there is one corpse to few.  Falco, the first-century Roman sleuth in this fine series, returns from his African adventure with the resources to move his family into a more comfortable living environment.  When his brother-in-law stumbles across a body that disappears before it can be identified, it is up to Falco to solve the murder.  With his ironic view of the world and his snappy patter, the emperor's spy proves he is up to the task.  He discovers how the dead man is connected to a six-year-old who is in line to be a vestal virgin.  His dealings with a former vestal virgin nearly costs him his life.  ONE VIRGIN TOO MANY has everything we have grown to expect from the work of Ms. Davis.  Her imperial Roman setting is believable.  Her characters are intriguing.  Her plot is well-paced.  ONE VIRGIN TOO MANY is one of best in the Falco series.  I recommend it heartily 
 in the 90s Jones flashed on the scene as the new flavor of the month, with stories showing up in the new yorker & other publications & his first collection garnering mega-hype.  having said that -- rest assured Jones is the real thing. this collection is the polar opposite of the crap coming out of most writer workshops. rather than write more tedious stories about the despair of ordinary people, jones writes about the fringe, albeit a fascinating and stimulating one. the characters range from boxers who read schopenhauer to aging deep see divers to doctors in Africa. you will be stimulated, engaged, enlightened and addicted. the hairs will stick up on the back of your neck. read this 
 When the Wailers were signed to island records in 1972, this marked the beginning of reggae to an international audience. The Wailers were already famous throughout the Carribbean, but worldwide they were nobody's. Catch a Fire changed all that. This was packaged as a rock album and the original album sleeve was actually a zippo lighter and when you opened the lighter the record would come out. This artwork is not original. The sound tapes were actually overdubbed with rock giutars and other instruments to make this album appeal to an American and English audience.  The first disc is all the original Jamaican takes which are better then the overdubbed ones released originally to the world in 1972.  The original Mixes have such a feel to them, and you can really appreciate why this band was so big in the Carribbean.  The Wailers first album has a feel unlike any other Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, or Bunny Wailer solo album.  the three of them together were simply amazing and no vocal trio will ever equal how good this band was.  With the Barrett brothers on drums and bass and a young Tyrone Downie on the keyobards, this band was well on the path to stardom, and Catch a Fire was the start. If you have a music collection, you need this Deluxe Edition in your collection 
 I, like Kimberly, by chance caught this movie on television about 5 years ago.  I cried at the end and kicked myself in the head repeatedly for not taping it !!  I have since been searching high and low for a copy of it only to learn today that it is FINALLY available on DVD! I was ecstatic to learn this and am ordering my copy immediately.  The characters are realistic, you find yourself feeling what they are feeling. It is a hauntingly beautiful love story which brought me to tears.  I highly recommend it.  Ladies,(or gentlemen?)if you are feeling sentimental about someone, rent or buy this film, pop open a good Merlot or other libation, press "play" and enjoy!!!You will not be disappointed!! 
 This is one of those rare books that strives to be painstakingly honest, with no pre-conceived agenda.  I'm a very conservative, straight Baptist woman who also happens to be a physician AND to have many gay friends, whom I love dearly.  I have to say this one reference has been more helpful for me than any other source I have read--and I think I've read almost all of them!  This is such a difficult issue and so divisive for so many.  If everyone read this one book, I think that might not be the case anymore.  Rev. Sundby has stayed true to the Biblical passages, using the original Greek translations.  I think this book could be one way God has employed for healing relationships that have been troubled by the "gay vs. straight" controversy.  We're all sinners and we all need His grace.  Rev. Sundby deals with this beautifully 
 I liked most of this cd, but I don't know what was up with sticking a rap song at the end of a goth/industrial comp? I really like Alkaline Trio's cover of Lucretia My Reflection. 
 The sequel to Huntingtower features the lovable Scottish grocer Dickson McCunn together with the now all-grown-up Gorbals Die-Hards--or some of 'em anyway. A newspaper magnate is kidnapped...by young divinity students, for a joke.  Yes, you heard that right. The disappearence causes quite a splash in international circles, however, and when Die-Hards Dougal and Jaikie come across the magnate at a lonely farmhouse and agree to carry a message for him, Stuff Happens. Not the usual kind of thing one might expect from a book about conspiracies, revolutions, and the fast world of journalism, but enough to keep the pages turning 
 This track alone is worth 5 stars.  The rest of the album is ok.  But believe me when you LISTEN to the track, and how it applies to todays "illusion" of hip-hop its amazing how this 20yr old track is still kicking knowledge before you were in diapers.  A must have for all hip-hop enthusiast 
 Thomas Schatz does a remarkable job of diagraming the rise of the studio system in Hollywood. The book is remarkably easy to follow (compared to any of Andrew Sarris's works) and includes numerous photographs. He focuses most on the trials and tribulations of Universal Studios, Warner Bros. and MGM and their distinct, integrated studio styles (He mentions RKO as well).    Irving Thalberg, David O. Selznick, Daryl Zanuck and Hitchcock are featured prominently and rightfully so. Also, includes many of the  behind the scene battles between studios and directors/ producers.   There are some minor criticisms though. He almost completely ignores Paramount and Colombia. And the decline of the studio system is sparse compared to the rise of. But aside from that, this book is an enjoyable read and recommend it to anyone who is fascinated with early hollywood       
 I love this. Now my DVD's are in order and they fit perfectly 
 Ten years ago with the birth of my first child, I received 6 different books on baby care--all from the best sellers list.  Over the next 10 years each of them, at one time or another, was heaved against a wall at 2 am or tossed into the kitchen trash can.  Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care helped me to correctly diagnose croup in my 6 month old daughter, which led to a call to the pediatrician as opposed to a trip to the ER.  Dr. Spock calmly and reassuringly helps parents learn THEY are the experts about their own children 
 Are you feeling hungry today? Bullfrog Pops by Rick Walton is a weird, but cool story. The frog named Bullfrog is like Pac-man, always shutting and opening his mouth. Bullfrog mostly never stops eating in this book.  I really think young kids should check it out, especially 3rd graders.                                                                                                                                                                                                   The pictures may not be the best, but the background and setting are the best part of the book.  Bullfrog Pops has lots of great colors and does not have many words, so this book is good for young kids that love pictures. The way the letters are printed was unique and also the favorite saying in the book, "But, I'm still hungry!"   	The book's setting takes place in either Texas or Mexico.  Kids who love staring at tasty treats like pizza, and at all junk food, especially quesadillas --- you'll love this book. I also love the way the book tells you not to eat too much and not to be greedy about something.  I think it's a great book for youngsters.  In the middle of the story the town's people try to arrest Bullfrog.  I have to say it would be a terrific book to see, look, and checkout at a library near you.  The setting matches the book because the food all looks like there from Mexico or Texas.  It would be better if they came up with a Bullfrog two.  I recommend this book for all ages-rated E. The book is full of laughter and has good pictures and is cool.  If you ever go to a library, check out Bullfrog Pops for sure and make me proud. Oh and make sure you read it, ok! 
 Important lessons from this amazing book:   1. Less is not always more, more is more.  2. Characters can be complex. In fact, they must be. 3. Dubus' world is a luscious, richly painted place--why do other writers render their world in black and white?  4. Stories can wrap their arms around you and embrace you for days--even weeks. They can slow you down, in all the best ways. 5. Details--By the end of this trio of novellas, you will have been to another place. It's good to get away.  Get lost here. It's an important place to be 
 Digital picture frame has a very good display and is very easy to use I had purchased one some time ago and bought this one for a christmas gift. It is well worth the cost 
 I have enjoyed this series.  While there are several books they all seem to be a little different in story line.  I like that it isn't just drama all over.  My favorite books in the series have been the ones that are period stories, where you are looking at life in a different era, finding out about a current characters family history and how it all fits together 
 I've been reading Harry Bosch from day one and to this day he is one of my favorite authors (#2 on a list of 10). Here and there I had loaned a lot of my books to others, and for one reason or another didn't get most of them back. Seeing this made me want to read Michael Connelly all over again so I'm buying them again (and nobody borrows them this time!). I promise you will love reading Harry Bosch 
 All the essentials and more from Martha and the Vandellas can be found on this excellent CD. I decided this was so good that I eventually bought four twofers containing eight of their original albums plus extra tracks, but this collection will be enough for most of you.  Dancing in the street is, of course, by far their most famous song, but there is much more to their music than that. Among their other big American hits were Come and get these memories, Heat wave (superbly covered by Linda Ronstadt on her Prisoner in disguise album in the seventies), Quicksand, Im ready for love, Nowhere to run, Honey chile, Jimmy Mack and My baby loves me. Some of these were also hits in Britain and other countries.  Forget me not (a song inspired by the Vietnam conflict) was a hit in Britain, although it was only a B-side in America. Another Vietnam-inspired song, I should have been proud, appears to have been too sensitive for radio stations when it was released in 1970, so it was withdrawn and was therefore not a hit.  I've only mentioned a few songs, but there are plenty of minor American hits and B-sides, which show that Martha and the Vandellas were capable of singing the slower songs, but that what they were really good at was singing danceable, upbeat sixties pop music. If Martha cant inspire you to get up and dance, who can 
 Frederica is without doubt my favourite Georgette Heyer novel - and I like her novels very much! What makes Frederica so good? Simply that she has populated this book with wonderful characters, amusing dialogue, interesting historical setting and a love story which is gentle and fulfilling.  The basic plot is that Frederica, a rather managing girl with three brothers and one sister, all younger than her, is attempting to launch her beautiful sister Charis into society so that she can make a good marriage. Frederica enlists the assistance of her sort-of cousin, the Marquis of Alverstoke, in this - and he agrees to spite his sisters. Alverstoke is an uncaring, flighty rake who doesn't do anything for anyone else and is hugely selfish. Through his interaction with Frederica and her two youngest brothers, Jessamy and Felix, Alverstoke is brought out of his state of almost continual boredom and takes real responsibility for his adopted cousins.  The power in this story is the exquisite way in which Heyer portrays her characters. We are shown Alverstoke with all his faults, yet we also get glimpses into what makes him in some ways a good man - for example the honourable and fair way in which he treats his secretary, Charles, and in the way that he takes on responsibilities to his adopted wards in order to lessen some of the load on Frederica's shoulders. Although Frederica initially comes across as a woman without fault, as the story progresses we see her occasional blindness in dealings with her sister and her eldest brother Harry; Frederica wants Charis to make a good match but Charis doesn't want that for herself. As the story progresses Alverstoke becomes more responsible, more aware of the needs of others and more aware of the effect he has on them. He takes care to hide his interest in Frederica from society so that she is not teased about it. As for Frederica's feelings for him, we do not hear much of the story from her point of view but it becomes clear by things that she says that she considers him very important to her... until of course the end of the book when they become engaged and she discovers what it is to be truly in love.  There are many other sub-plots running along in the main story - the romance between Alverstoke's secretary Charles Trevor and Alverstoke's cousin Chlo Dauntry is one. The various men who offer marriage to Frederica because they see her qualities and the different way in which they are portrayed is great fun. But the central part of the book - the conversations between Frederica and Alverstoke - are a delight.  This is one of those books that you can read again and again and enjoy even more each time. Heyer has masterfully described the way that a bored rake, Alverstoke, can change his whole nature when he finally finds the right person, the woman who is a conversational match for him; I also think that her ability to gradually unveil the faults in her heroine, small that they may be, is also good - it's annoying to read books with `perfect' people as they are so unlike us.  Like all Heyer books, the historical setting, dialogue and description of places is perfect. This book is just a fantastic read in so many different ways - buy it 
 Am using the light for early morning and late evening trash hauling.  Heavy duty work.  Have tried several cap lights and this one works out the best so far.  The lights that fit on top of the cap do not shine where you are trying to look, and we have not found any other cap lights that are as bright as this one 
 The Martones have provided clear, graceful, & funny translations of Italian Renaissance tales in the tradition of Boccaccio.  Excellent introductory or background reading for the period, plus you may want to retell some of the stories to your friends!  Authors whose novellas are in the collection include Bandello and Sermin 
 I learned quite a bit about Bowerman, the University of Oregon track program, the running boom in this country, the Olympics and the history of Nike's early years. I pretty easy read that is full of history 
 This release was obscured when some DJ in California turned Red Red Wine into a coast-to-coast sensation just as this self-titled gem hit the markets.  Sales were slow and that's a real shame as this is easily some of Cambell brother's best song writing, full of catchy hooks and infectious rhythms that never grow old.  Buy, put it in your player, you'll be tapping your foot and singing along within minutes 
 I was drawn to read this book by Professor Fischer's recent appearance on C-Span, and was not disappointed.  It may be true as other reviewers have noted that he sometimes seems to stretch the facts to fit his theory, but I was amazed at how often as I read I said to myself, "Yes, I knew that, but now I understand why."  Fischer's thesis can explain why the Democrats could elect a Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton but not a John Kerry, and how the red and blue states got that way. There is always a danger in stereotyping, of course, but it helps if you know where the stereotypes come from and how much of them are valid--Fischer's book is a great help in knowing ourselves 
 An outstanding piece of kitchen cookware. It looks and performs exactly like All Clad for about 1/4 the price. It cooks exceptionally well AT MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURES THAN YOU ARE ACCUSTOM TO. Because of the aluminum center/core, there is very uniform heat throughout the pot, including the sides. The handles can get hot (because they are close to the body of the pot) while boiling with a gas stove, but otherwise are non-hot pad cool.  Don't believe the reviews about hard to clean, food sticks etc. It is &*(%. In my opinion these reviewers don't know how to use the cookware properly. If you are brazing/browning, use a small shot of Pam (I have tried al types of oils, but this works best) and make sure that the temperature ~ 25% less than  normal. Also, Bar Keepers Friend, as recommended in the users manual, is perfect for making the inner and outer surfaces shine. It is non-abrasive.   This pot is the perfect size for soups, large quantities of sauces, and roasts. It is more manageable than the 8 Q one that comes with the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro set. I use it more often than the larger pot.  Fantastic product and great value. I bought it for 1/2 price on Amazon in December 2006. 
 A welcome change to see things through a great poet's eye.  Brilliant comparisons of the cultures of two great countries Mexico and India, a  culture that died and a culture that still lives and is thriving 
 I bought this on a whim, after I'd previously picked up Fantastic Damage by El P and was interested in getting deeper into the Def Jux sound. That said, I thought at the time that El-P did the bulk of the production for his artists. This is untrue; Labor Days has no production by El-P; the sound is decidedly more organic - something closer to traditional hip-hop. Until this point, I've only negatively criticized the album, and yet, I gave it 5 stars. I should mention that, within a week of buying Labor Days, I went out and bought Float and Bazooka Tooth, the albums before and after this one, respectively. Because while it wasn't what I expected, I loved it anyway. Aesop's raspy, rapid-fire delivery, and his poetic, metaphor-filled content, in conjunction with Blockhead's and his own minimalist production, surely make this album a classic, and I will direct all of my friends who say they're seeking more intelligent hip-hop to this. I won't get into the track-by-track rating thing that I usually do; I'll just mention some of the definite highlights: "Daylight," with it's memorable bass-line, insightful lyrics, and equally insightful (yet surprisingly catchy) chorus, "Save Yourself," which addresses those hip-hop traditionalists who'd rather talk about their skills and diss the bling bling-ers than say anything meaningful, "No Regrets," in which Aesop tells a story about a girl who lived the dream she wanted to live, as opposed to dreaming the dream and complaining that it hasn't been realized (like most people do), "Battery," with a mournful, beautiful track that I could relate to, in the general terms of weariness with life (Aesop quote: "there's smoke in my iris/but I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids") and the "9-5ers Anthem," which also spoke to me, cuz I hate my job. Plus, it boasts one of the best beats I've heard in recent memory.  These are my personal faves; others probably would say they like all the tracks but these, but this is poetry; you either get it or you don't, and it's all subjective. Pick Labor Days up, and decide for yourself what you like. 
 With "Midnight At The Oasis" starting off the CD, you could think that this disc will be a wash. But, just a couple of cuts down, you will find "Radar Love" "The Night Chicago Died"  "Keep On Smilin" "Rock Me Gently" "Beach  Baby" and "I Can Help." My favorite on this disc is  "Life Is A Rock But The Radio Rolled Me," a look back at the  present and the past, done just a little different. One Bo Donaldson &  The Heywoods song is enough, so one could have been replaced by something  else. But, this is yet another gem of a CD showing the inconsistancies of  the 70's 
 Bend it like Beckham is an uplifting film that will inspire and uplift you. This is a smart, funny and thought provoking film with a likeable heroine you just want to root for. I urge every mother to give her daughter this DVD for a birthday, Christmas or graduation gift. I think they'll thank you for it. Bend it Like Beckham follows Jess, a young British girl of Indian descent on her quest to become a soccer player like her idol David Beckham. She strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional Indian parents who want her to conform to traditional Indian culture. I love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family. She perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream. There are a lot of funny moments in this movie; I don't want to give too much away THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL. I love this movie; this is how movies should be made. The cinematography in this movie is amazing; the camera disappears and we see real life transpiring on screen. The entire cast disappears into their characters becoming real people you care about. Look for Keira Knightley in a supporting role. A Shawn James five star essential movie. Definitely get this movie along with the wonderful Muriel's Wedding, a great Australian film that follows a similar type heroine on her journey.  
 Lorna's book is explicit about how to generate referrals!!!  It is the best book on this subject I've ever seen.  Amazingly crisp, readable, doable steps to great referrals!!! 
 This book is a wonderfully crafted piece of fiction that pulls the reader in immediately.  Set in modern day Africa we are brought into the very private and abusive family life of Kambili, her brother Jaja, and their parents, Eugene and Beatrice.  Eugene is the product of colonialism and the Catholic missionaries having come into Africa, and it is within his own family that the circle of abuse continues.  The story is told from the view point of his daughter Kambili who is neither bitter nor angry, but is merely a timid young adolescent trying to understand her place in this world.  Themes are beautifully interwoven thoughout this masterpiece.  Color is a constant thread and often the harbinger of things to come, and the hibiscus are also used in similar manner.  If you are looking for a worth while piece of fiction this is it, and if you are looking for something more you have come to the right place, since I feel this book appeals both to the scholar and the casual reader.  I was unable to put the book down once I got started and would recommend it to anyone 
 I have watched a lot of WWII DVDs and found that these movies while hollywoodized to an extent are pretty accurate. These movies will entertain you completely!!!  This is a great group of war films and I enjoyed each and every one of them thouroughly!!!  Cant beat the price either! 
 Decent lightweight jacket for anytime, not sure if it is just my jacekt, but one of my sleeves seems to be sewed slightly skewed so I have to twist it around to get my arm to go in. Could send it back, but not worth the trouble 
 Tuchman's book presents a thourough, redable account of the fourteent century and its major events (the Black Death and the start of the Hundred Years' War, for starters). While a few of the details of medieval life included in the book have inevitably been superceded by more recent research, this is more than made up for by the book's many strong points.   Tuchman's prose is clear and far from textbook-like, but without seeming to make a point of it, and her decision to follow the life of one of the more important participants in many of the century's numerous wars/battles/etc. unifies the narration much more than would be possible otherwise. She also draws enough comparisons to more recent history (many from the two World Wars) to explain how and why events unfolded.  Given the book's length (it took me several weeks to read, despite reading over lunch and a good-sized commute) I can't really recommend it to someone who really wants to know about particular events of the 1300s. Many good books have been written about both the Hundred Years' War and Black Death. But if you're looking for a history of the century as a whole, rather than just the plague or the war, this is a good book 
 Emma is a very vivid character. She is somebody desperately looking to elevate herself above her petit bourgeois environment. She craves riches and refinement. She craves excitement. She is dreadfully capricious and deceitful in her quest to rise above. She has poetic dreams of living life in castles and on beautiful islands with dashing lovers. The most realistic part to her is that she is not particularly tinged with any nobility but is greedy and brutal.   Her husband Charles is somebody who seems not as well done as Emma at least in the first parts of the book, but he becomes more clear towards the end, particularly after the denouement of the story. He is a timid man with not much confidence, easily dominated by women. He is perfectly content with being a husband and father. The limited intellectual, social and material opportunities available in the village of Yonville and surrounding areas appear to suit him just fine.   Among authors of the first rank, Flaubert's ability to tell a story, to set a scene is perhaps towards the lower end of the spectrum and he not uncommonly seems to try too hard to strive for effects on the reader. But the book overall is an enjoyable read, particularly after the Bovarys move to Yonville. The story takes off after that.   When they move to Yonville, we are introduced to the character of Monsieur Homais, my favorite character of the book by far. Homais is the village pharmacist. He fancies himself a very important scientific authority and intellectual in general, enjoys pestering people with his conversation and company, is obsequious before social superiors and bullying towards his inferiors. He is a very cocksure middlebrow. Homais seems to be a figure on which Flaubert puts all the ridiculous and irritating personal characteristics of human beings. Flaubert pours out a great deal of amusing irony in describing his actions. Indeed there is an irony underlying much of the novel in describing the petit-bourgeois characters that compose this book. But Flaubert does not seem to be without compassion in the novel, interestingly, especially when considering that he had a very violent dislike for the rural bourgeoisie in all its forms.   The last quarter of the book is really superb stuff. I really enjoyed it.It is very well done, with simplicity. The reader gets a strong feeling from Flaubert of the dreadful insoluble tragedy of the situation and a stark feeling for the dark side of life.    Also I must say I was impressed with Flaubert's rendering of the speech at the village agricultural fair by the provincial politician. Flaubert seems to have had an excellent ear for the sort of platitudes that such a politician in 1840's France might have given, for the speech is very realistic. The scene at that fair with the old peasant woman winning the prize is brilliantly done.   
 This is a gem for organizations willing to take a new road to generating funds.  Ms. Grey and Ms. Skildum Reid have provided a roadmap for  nonprofits who are tired of fundraising and writing grants.  Kudos to them 
 There is tons of helpful advice in this book from starting out to race day tips.

 "I pushed myself up and startled a sparrow. It flew down the road and took up a new roost near a large cardboard box nestled in the cedars. Something stirred, and it flew again. I looked closer and recognized the man Mama had fed last night asleep inside the box. He shifted and pulled his knees up closer to his chest. "I stared at him a long time, watching him sleep, wondering if he was hungry, wondering what sorrowful thing had led him to make a cardboard box his home. I thought about our tar-paper shack and remembered the relief on Daddy's face when he told us about it."   It's the summer of 1933, and twelve-year-old Sadie Wynn has (reluctantly) arrived with her family at a bayfront encampment on Texas's Aransas Bay. Shortly thereafter, her daddy purchases a little shack behind the seawall. Sadie's parents were forced to sell their longtime Missouri home for "a piddling amount," because there was no more work for her father--a talented mechanic and carpenter--now that the Dust Bowl had driven away the community's farmers. Among those to previously leave was Sadie's beloved best friend, Wilma, whose family headed to California.   Now Sadie's dad plans to build a small boat and become a fisherman. Until school starts, Sadie is allowed to accompany her new friend Dollie in lining up at four A.M. for a chance to peel shrimp for a nickel per bucket.   "I looked back at the door and saw people being turned away. I remembered Daddy saying, 'These are hard times, Babygirl,' and I wondered if the whole world was like this--too many people and not enough jobs."   Prior to their decision to leave Missouri, Sadie had clearly been cocooned in a loving, sheltered childhood. The story's first surprise for us--and first eye-opening moment for Sadie occurs on the drive to Texas, when they stop at a store far from the home they've left.   "If Bobby hadn't lost our map in the river and Daddy hadn't taken a wrong turn, we would've never had to stop at that store. I guess that was the first time I really saw Daddy the way strangers saw him. Until then, I thought the world was full of daddies like mine. "We parked near the storefront and stirred up a cloud of dust that hung in the air thick as fog. I rubbed my stinging eyes and reached for the door, but Mama said no. Jacob and Emily huffed their disappointment. Bobby whined. I leaned back and turned my attention to the handful of men sitting on empty crates beside the screen door. They watched us, too, through the settling dust but kept on talking. "Daddy grabbed the handle on his open car door, swung himself out, and sat on the ground. The men hushed. Bags of tobacco gaped open, and cigarettes hung from their lips. "Daddy's shriveled lower legs lay folded in the dirt. He wore heavy socks on his twisted feet, and his shortened pants legs were tied up with cording. He wrapped it all around his small calves and over his knees every morning to keep the extra cloth out of his way. I watched him lean forward and fix his palms in the dirt. Then, using his strong arms like crutches, he lifted himself off the ground, swung his body forward, and sat. Then he did it all over again. His dangling calves and feet trailed limp beneath him with each swinging stride. "The men never said a word, but their wide-eyed looks followed Daddy right through the screen door."   THE TRUTH ABOUT SPARROWS has a decidedly gentle tone to it, as Sadie learns about friendship and about being in the same boat as everyone else. It's a book that will appeal to many 4th, 5th, and 6th graders.   I'm curious to see how those readers react to Sadie's proud attitude about who she is:   "...[I]t didn't take long before I noticed a rift deep as a canyon running between our side of the tracks and the town kids. To be fair, lots of them were nice...but plenty others never talked to us, never even looked at us unless they thought we weren't watching. Then I'd hear snickers and whispers..."[B]eing lumped into the same stewing pot with everyone on that bayfront made me mad. They were good people who didn't deserve to be treated so poorly, but we weren't like them at all. We had a nice home once, one I planned to see again someday."   Despite that gentleness and the virtuousness of Sadie's life lessons, I was thoroughly engaged by this story. I loved to see that the result of Sadie's dad being so personable, so skilled, hard working and determined was that people the family encountered were quick to see beyond his disability. And I really enjoyed the picture that the author paints of life on the Gulf for these people during the Depression: salt air and close families, the Cannery and the hurricanes, the shacks and the flour sack clothing, and the cracked red hands from lye soap and shelling shrimp.   Back in 1933, they only had to smell the fish and that shrimp to insure that it was safe to eat. These days, seafood often comes with warning labels like cigarettes. Back in 1933, you could trust in having plenty of fresh water, even if you had to hand-pump it, or carry it from a neighbor's house, as Sadie's family has to do. These days you need a chemical lab to determine what you're getting with your H-2-O. And that's assuming that someone hasn't drained the river or aquifer before the supply reaches you.   
 i thought this book was good although i enjoyed the 1st better.. i hope they come out with a third 
 This book is full of wonderful information and exercises that will change your way of living.  I have been using the "Tiger Moves" ( 7 exercises that will change the shape of your body) for about two weeks now and have noticed a difference in my physique. There are workouts included for specific areas and I have tried them,  and believe me they are challenging at the beginning, but the end result is worth it. You are working muscle against muscle and no expensive equipment is needed. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to change their life 
 Although there are tremendous similarities to the Sebastian Junger's Perfect Storm masterpiece (the geographical area in which the story takes place), this is not the Perfect Storm.  It's a great book which I absolutely could not put down!  I live in Beverly, MA which is near where some of the big events in the book take place and it so happened that as I was reading the book, my wife had me drop by a yard sale at the Coast Guard housing in Beverly.  What a wonderful book and one which transmits to the reader quickly and artfully the tremendous power of the sea!  
 This book by James Baldwin left me with more than just the simple enjoyment of a good read, but it also left me to think deeper about the issues and reasons behind racism and races, power and control, and the even the various proposed resolutions to end racism.  In the beginning, Baldwin shares how he (and a lot of minorities) come into knowing racism as a child growing up.  A lot of what he shared I can remember feeling or questioning when I was growing up.  Baldwin also analyzes the solution proposed to end racism and also gives his opinion on what it would take for all races to actually achieve total equality amongst all.  Even today, this book makes you look deeper into this issue and at the people involved and why we all act and react the way we do.  Only after understanding can we begin to apply valid solutions.  This book should be read by everyone 
 I was looking for a snack that contained high protein and something I could eat when I was in a hurry or to while I was at work. I was reccomended ostrim by a gym buddy of mine. What a great purchase, these things taste great and are very juicy. One downside, yet understandable. I get extremely bad gas from these, I didnt know I was capable of producing such pungent bombs until I ate a few of these. Watch out of that, so other than that side note, these treats are worthy of buying. Enjo 
 Audra could sing anything and I'd listen to it, but these songs are great. "Bill", "I Won't Mind" and "The Man That Got Away" are among my favorites, on this CD, but all the songs are great. I can't recommend this cd enough 
 This book is a great place to start for those like me who are interested in quantum physics and the newer superstring theories, but could care less about learning any of the complex math involved.  Prof. Briane Greene is a very accessible author, and uses good practical examples to explain the theories, beginning with Einsteinian relativity, to Quantum physics, to superstring theory.  There's a lot of information here, so one needs to read this book a little at a time and let things "sink in."  Also recommended is the very well produced DVD presentation of this book by Nova, which stars Prof. Greene. 
 Hi! I'm Maru from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I consider that 'Lights and Sounds' it's an incredible cd. It's amazing songs, from the 1st to the last, you won't get tired of listening to it. It has great lyrics, and you can hear awesome melodies.  The violin, the riffs, the bass lines and the drum show an extremely good music.  I really like it, because it sounds really cool.. It's one of my fave. record. 
 LeAnn Rimes is just phenomenal! I love her new song here! It's the whole reason to get this album 
 I have read nearly all of Michael Connelly's Bosch novels, and I would say that CITY OF BONES is one of the better ones in the series.   I don't think this novel rivals the best Bosch books like THE CONCRETE BLONDE and THE LAST COYOTE.  But this novel is better than novels like ANGEL FLIGHT and the subpar DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT.  This novel is essentially a "cold case" mystery involving the recently discovered bones of a young child who was murdered over twenty years ago.  Bosch tries to get to the bottom of the child's murder, and uncovers a lot of family secrets along the way.  I found the plot realistic and highly interesting and I thought Connelly did a good job with the story.  This is a real page-turner.  The most annoying aspect of this book is the romantic subplot, which seems forced and underdeveloped.  I also find it unconvincing that Bosch, a man in his fifties, would have a beautiful woman in her mid-thirties throwing herself at him.  I was also highly disappointed with how this relationship was resolved.  In my opinion, Connelly has never done a convincing job of creating a believable romantic relationship for Bosch.  Overall, though, CITY OF BONES is a great read and much better than other crime novels out there.  Highly recommended 
 Scott Poulson-Bryant is a bright young artist with heady credentials and a true gift for creative thinking and well-crafted writing skills.  He joins the growing ranks of young African American strong writers such as E.L. Ayala, E. Lynn Harris, Keith Boykin, J.L. King, Caesar Brunswick, Christopher David, and Stanley Bennett Clay who not only address issues heretofore considered taboo in the Black community, but succeed not only as brave new voices but also as gifted, important writers.  HUNG: A MEDITATION ON THE MEASURE OF BLACK MEN IN AMERICA starts out with a terrific cover, promises revelation of secrets everyone wants to know, addresses his reader with pertinent facts, and then progresses to relax and offer a rather personalized memoir of his experiences as a black man in America, a man who knows the myths and the realities about phallic secrets, and shares his own insights as well as those of gentlemanly unnamed confidents from whom he gathers his facts.  Along the way Poulson-Bryant not only discusses phallus size, but he also explores the mystique of black men who model for books (Mapplethorpe is a frequent reference point), the porn industry, the world of athletes (yes, naming names), the rap world, and the executive world.  But he doesn't limit his meditation to experiences interviewing men: Poulson-Bryant wisely includes women in his foray of questioning the importance of size as a feature of desirability vs. myth vs. disadvantage.  It is a well-rounded book and one that never lets the interest lag.  But what one comes away with from this book is an appreciation of the exceptional style of writing of Scott Poulson-Bryant.  He is a writer of charm, of humor, of wit, and of intelligence.  This reader would like to see how he performs in the field of fiction: in reportage he is up there with the best!

 This delightful story of two Oxford graduate friends, Jane and Prudence derives much of its humorous charm from Barbara Pym's fondness for stories centred around the Anglican Church. Jane has recently moved with her husband, Nicholas, to the village where he has just become the new vicar. She is very well-intentioned in trying to arrange for her friend, Prudence, to become romantically involved with the recently-widowed Fabian Driver. But a spinster of the parish, Jessie Morrow, is not to be thwarted in her own plans to 'land' Mr Driver. The ensuing intrigue has Pym's usual twists and turns leading to some quaint humour along the way before the matter is resolved 
 This book is a step by step guide with suggested modifications to fit the needs of any group.  The worksheets, included on an accompanying CD, are very useful.  I highly recommend this book to anyone involved in strategic planning for any organization - public, private or non-profit.  
 This is a great item, but, it does have some flaws. I got this for my 2 month old, and he loved it! Now he's 6 months and loves it just as much. The thing is, you need to manually push the button, and then you can use the remote. After it plays all the music, and it shuts off, the only way to turn it back on, is to press the button yourself. Not great when you're flying on the freeway! But, it still seems to calm my baby as soon as the music goes on 
 Good beginners review of 12 volt systems. Author has good grasp of the subject. Needs revising as many aspects of boating and electricity has changed since written 
 Its so sad that this movie didn't do better at the box office and more people don't know about it. Like most people say here, it should be a regular holiday classic. Despite the langauge which can be cleaned up for the kids and granny.I've seen it 30 times and I love it more and more each time.  If you haven't seen it, you need to.... buy it you won't be dissapointed 
 I bought this book for my young bachelor son; but after going through it, I am going to keep it and buy him another one.  It is up to date on cleaning products, and tells you about so many things that most other books of this type don't tell you; such as, diagrams on how to iron, how to sew.  It tells you when fruits and vegetables are in season and how to tell when they are ripe. I think it is the most complete book of it's kind that I have ever seen.  It would be excellent for newly weds, bachelor sons or daughters just getting their 1st apartment.  And it is great for someone that has been housekeeping for over 30 years...like me!!  Buy it, you won't regret it 
 I bought the original book..the schwarzbein principle... and than this one.  I was really glad this book was available.  Sometimes it is confusing to work a *plan* into your daily diet (if that makes sense)...  even if you understand the concept.  This book was very helpful in making recipes that were very good, easy...and within this plan.  I didnt have any difficulty finding ingredients for the recipes and i am really enjoying some of them alot.  If you bought the original book this cookbook would make staying with the plan easier as you dont have to come up with your own recipes...or *re-do* ones you have...  very good book 
 I thought that this text was excellent.  Definately a great primer on the subject of material science and engineering 
                     Empire Strikes Back                     By: Donald F. Glut                         N. Muttalib                          Period 2    The book is about a boy names Luke who is a jedi (a warrior). The Rebels (good guys) have a base set up in a really cold and freezing planet called Hoth. Then the imperial soldiers (bad guys) attack with walkers in that battle Luke figures out how to destroy them by tying but still loses the battle and the base is destroyed. Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and C3PO escape in the Millennium Falcon and head for the rebel rendezvous point, while Luke and R2D2 go to the planet Dagobah. Luke has had a vision from a ghostly Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to seek Jedi Master Yoda there to complete his training. Imperial chase the Falcon, but to Darth Vader's anger Han escapes from capture. The Falcon's hyperdrive is broken, however, and Han diverts to Bespin, a floating city and mining colony. Han has a friend there named Lando he was a administrator there. But Lando turns out to be forced by Darth Vader to turn in Leia. But on Dagobah (planet) Luke has a vision that Leia and others are in trouble and he meets Yoda who trains him with the force. On Bespin Vader sets a trap using Leia and Han as bait for Luke to come. Vader decides to freeze Luke and present him to the Emperor he tests it on Han and it works. Han is turned into bounty hunter Boba Fett and is sent to Jabba. Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3P0 are sent into Vader's ship. Luke arrives in Bespin and Vader duels with him and cuts his hand off the he tells Luke that he is his father. Then Luke falls off and hangs of something. He then gets rescued by Leia and Chewbacca.     There are many parts I really like in this book like when Darth Vader fights Luke and he says,"I am your father." I liked that quote because Vader told him a very big secret. Another one is when the rebels destroy the first walker they felt very happy."In trenches, Rebel troops cheered in triumph when they saw the assault machine topple." I liked that because the Rebels destroyed their walker.       There are also many parts I really disliked like when Darth Vader and Luke were dueling and Vader cuts his hand off."At that second, the Dark lords laser blade came across Luke's hand cutting it." I really did not like that also when Darth Vader fails to destroy Leia, Han, and Chewbacca."Darth Vader looked like a great silent god as he stood on the main control deck of his mammoth Star Destroyer.      I really liked this book I liked it because of the action and adventure it had it was really cool also when and how they fight this book was very good. 
 I have just finished this book and I can't say enough good things for what it brought to me.  I had heard of the book from something on Public TV and just had to have it.  I am 60 and my mother's family was from this area, but mother never talked much about that part of her history.  I had felt like there was an important part of me that I didn't understand.  This book just delighted my mind as I followed the closeness of the many people and how they lived and thought.  It was most interesting to me and I hope to read more of these tales if I can find them in large print.   I feel like a part of me is now alive as I understand more about the people and times in these mountains 
 This album is one of the greatest recordings ever released.  You have Blackmore who is one of the greatest guitarists of all time and you have his partner Night who can sing beuatiffly and who is a great lyricist as well.  This album has traces of Jethro Tull, Rainbow, Deep Purple, Mike Oldfield. It also has rock elements springkled in for good measure.  Nights vocals sound very similiar to Maggie Reilly who used to sing in Oldfields band.  My two favorite tracks are 25 Years and World of Stone.  Please give this album a chance and don't just dismiss this when you hear that it is Medievil music.  I am glad that I gave it a shot 
 This album is a masterpiece I don't care what anyone says. I have had this version of the album for about eight months and always listened to the stero mix cause I don't own a DVD audio player.     I decided to stick it into my parents DVD player turn on the good surround sound system they have and cranked it. The regular surround mix of the album sounded pretty good. Now I can't wait to hear it in 5.1 surround. Since my parents don't have a true 5.1 surround system it kinda bummed me out, but oh well. When listening to the Dolby surround stero mix you can hear things that you didn't while listening to the reg stereo mix. This album really comes to life when you stick it  in your DVD player or DVD-A player.   Anyone new to Nine Inch Nails should purchase this album, and If you don't own a DVD-audio player well this is one hell of an reason to run out and buy one. Hell this was my first NIN album to own and I'm glad I went with this and the SACD release of thils album 
 Very wistful, sweeping romantic melodies. A lot of the songs are very haunting, as though the composer was telling Hitchcock or the audience how dangerous it was that this man was becoming obsessive. This CD has a poor cover, it shouldn't pretend to market 'Psycho' and remember, rerecordings of any kind, especially when rerecording 'mono' in stereo, .. 
   I just got this a week ago and I still cannot get enough!  Barry is such a talent and it is so good to have this while we cannot be in Vegas to see the show Live.  Of course, Even when you are in Vegas you will find that Manilow is not an easy ticket to come by, He is sold out constantly, But you can enjoy him anytime on this superb 2 disc set.  Thanks Barry, I feel like I am right there everytime I play it!  My summary: BUY THIS GREAT 2 DISC SET AND GET TICKETS TO SEE THIS SHOW LIVE IN VEGAS SOON!!!  Excellence again from Manilow!! 
 Stunning song... what true passionate transcendental love making would sound like....and i love how dirty bjork gets in this song 
 Rob Bowman's work is the definitive work on the history of the Stax Record label.  I doubt there is anyone affiliated with the company who he has not interviewed.  It is also very well written and impossible to put down 
  Attempts by intellectuals or pseudo-intellectuals to intellectualize the moral concepts and basis of the book, Snow Falling on Cedars, have made me wary of certain discussion groups. I've always felt that the story was a simple one, not difficult to understand.  I recently attended a lecture presented by David Guterson.  Imagine my great surprise and pleasure when he said that Snow Falling on Cedars is about one thing: Injustice.  As a Jew, the empathy Guterson felt for the Japanese in America during WW2 was a natural extension of his ties to holocaust victims and the injustice served by man. Everything else in the book is a story relating to that injustice and how justice is finally served.  
 I adore "The Worm Ouroboros." It has flaws, or at least peculiarities, including a fascination with aristocracy and lack of concern for the "lower classes" rarely expressed so clearly in modern English literature -- perhaps not since the Tudors began eliminating "over-mighty subjects," and the Puritans started comparing the godly poor man in his cottage to the ungodly noble in his mansion (or King in his palace!) without regard to the "natural" order of things. By the 1580s, even Sir Philip Sidney's class-conscious "Arcadia" paid lip-service to rustic virtues, as Malory, a century before, had not. But not Eddison, over three centuries later.  Some, understandably, find this offensive, but it shouldn't be considered political (regardless of the author's own views). E.R. Eddison's narrative and the Homeric or medieval ethos of the book's characters fit together perfectly; and you can consider their attitude the most realistic feature of the narrative.  And it is quite a story. One of the sub-plots includes riding an unridable beast as a stage in climbing an unclimbable mountain, all of which is part of a side-effort (a rescue) in a struggle to kill an undying enemy.  The book is of a piece; gorgeous language (too much for some tastes), mighty heroes (and their adversaries) in colorful and expensive costumes and decorated armor, spectacular landscapes, weird animals from bestiaries and heraldry, magic gems from lapidaries, and stories from "Mandeville's Travels," all fitted together with correspondingly archaic notions of the Good and the Just. Achilles or Lancelot would be at home. So would medieval Norway's eccentric King Magnus Bare-legs, of Scots garb and sayings like "Kings are made for glory, not for long life," whom I am almost surprised not to find among the minor characters -- despite the book's arbitrary setting on "Mercury" (more of an astrological zone than a planet; Mercury as patron of eloquence), which troubles some readers.  And there are the nations of Witches, Demons, Goblins, Imps, and Pixies; names not related to their characteristics -- save that the lords of Demonland seem to have small horns (not mentioned of anyone else), and the late, unlamented, Ghouls were cannibals. One has to get used to thinking in terms of places: people from "waterish Witchland" and "many-mountained Demonland." There is this difference between the main heroes, the Demons, and the main villains, the Witches; the Demons are seen waging wars in defense of themselves and others, the Witches are out for conquest. But they all enjoy a fight; and, again, some lords of Witchland are perfectly decent to other members of the upper class, while the Demonland nobility doesn't seem to notice much how many common soldiers and seamen perish.  Ordinary farming folk going about their tasks do appear, but briefly, and not without a dignifying classical allusion (the Demon song against Corinius is a version of a Greek drinking song against the tyrant Pittacus); this sequence from daily life also suggests a bit of influence from Eddison's beloved Icelandic sagas, which otherwise contribute omens, pithy sayings, and some artifacts.  Magic plays a role -- used mainly by the villains, not so much because it is morally evil, but because it is so dangerous to the user that a more sensible sort of hero might rather take his chances in battle. The protagonists (despite mocking the petty gods of lesser nations), appeal to their thoroughly pagan gods, instead of casting spells -- and sometimes get an answer, at much less risk.  If you are sure you can't get over such issues, or won't be able to abide its elevated, frequently archaic, often Shakespearean, or at least Elizabethan or Jacobean, language, you probably shouldn't bother with the book.  If you think that you might enjoy it, for its high adventure and extravagant imagination, there is the question of what edition to read. It used to be that they were all quite similar, and the best answer was "whichever is available." This is no longer true. Both contents and price differ.  Over the years since I first read it 1967, I've become familiar with a number of editions. These include: the 1922 Jonathan Cape edition, the 1952 E.P. Dutton second American edition, with Orville Prescott's Introduction added to that by James Stephens for the 1926 American edition, and the 1962 trade paperback reprint of this in Crown's Xanadu Library (all three identical except the added front-matter); the 1967 Ballantine mass-market paperback, reset from the Dutton edition, with Barbara Remington's cover art (and some of its nine later reprintings), plus a 1975 copy of the 1971 Pan/Ballantine British edition, and the 1977 and 1981 Del Rey/Ballantine tenth and twelfth printings, on which the older Ballantine cover was replaced with a less attractive one by Murray Tinkelman (originally in green, later in yellow); and, finally, the 1991 re-set edition from Dell, annotated by Paul Edmund Thomas, with a cover of characters and beasties interpreted by Tim Hildebrandt.  (The Hildebrandt cover is, typically, "realistic" -- posed-looking, including studio lighting. I much prefer the crowded, chaotic Remington cover, with its stylized mountains and sea, monsters, ships, and contending armies, and the titular tail-biting serpent, a symbol of eternity, as a frame which intrudes into the landscape.  It is recognizably related to Remington's then-recent triptych of covers for Ballantine's "Lord of the Rings." although fortunately far more consistent with the spirit of Eddison's book than those were with Tolkien's. She did an equally good job, in a slightly different style, with the Ballantine 1967-1969 editions of Eddison's three "Zimiamvia" novels, "Mistress of Mistresses," "A Fish Dinner in Memison," and "The Mezentian Gate," catching their High Medieval/Renaissance flavor.)  Although I have some quibbles, and a few major objections, to Thomas's annotations, and to certain omissions, this last is a highly desirable edition, a delight to Eddison's fans, and a resource to those who might be, if they could catch his layered allusions (he often incorporated quotations -- some medieval and adapted, some *literally* sixteenth or seventeenth century English) and follow his frantically rich vocabulary. (Thomas also edited Dell's "Zimiamvia: A Trilogy" omnibus.)  If you are a first-timer, though, it should be remembered that a lot of very literate and intelligent people seem to find Eddison unreadable, even with assistance. You might be one of them. With this in mind, a library copy might be the best start, if available, or an inexpensive used copy of the much-reprinted Ballantine edition (or its rather scarcer Del Rey avatar). I will describe third and fourth options at the end.  The main down side of the Dell trade paperback edition (besides it being out of print, alas!) is that it was the first I know of not to contain the full set of illustrations and chapter decorations by Keith Henderson. Although these vary in quality (and Ballantine's less than intense printing  of sharp blacks was not helpful), they were approved by the author, and form a part of his image of the book. (They also have a fascinating relationship to Henderson's roughly contemporary illustrations to a lavish edition of another story of exotic adventure, Prescott's "Conquest of Mexico;" a selection of these were reprinted in "The Fall of the Aztec Empire" in 1993.)  In what may have been a production oversight, rather than an editorial decision, it also lacks the ballad excerpt that should serve as an epigram (see under the Kessinger reprint, below).  Some of the later reprintings by other firms seem to have followed the same assumption that the illustrations could be partly or completely eliminated; a circumstance that makes the 1999 Replica Books edition (hardcover and trade paperback), based directly on the British first edition, particularly attractive. The (British) Millennium Fantasy Masterworks edition of 2002, although possibly reset, and also lacking the American multiple introductions, MAY have ALL the art, and, if available, should be less expensive. I also have yet to see the 2004 American edition from Wildside.  At the opposite extreme from the Replica edition in hardcover is the similarly-priced (!) Kessinger reprint (and its very inexpensive E-Book version, with the same pagination), which not only drops the illustrations -- and the layers of introductions to the American editions -- but in resetting the text also drops the opening epigram, and the appended material Eddison provided for the reader. A mood-setting selection from the ballad of "Thomas the Rhymer" should open the book; it is missing from the Kessinger text, as in the Dell edition, for no apparent reason. (Copyright infringement on Sir Walter Scott's version of the text is unlikely to be a problem!)  Eddison's main appendix, the "Argument with Dates" organizes the considerable amount  of back-story offered in widely scattered places throughout the book, and incidentally demonstrates how Eddison had worked out travel times, relative ages of characters, and other details, all in a few pages. It too is gone, which is sure to give some readers the impression that Eddison's "art that conceals art" is actually just confusion.  The "Bibliographical Note on the Verses," which identifies most (not quite all) of Eddison's wide-ranging borrowings of English and Greek verse literature (and specifies the translation of the Icelandic saga read aloud in the "Induction," but not the many echoes of other prose) may not be missed by some, but being able to find some of the (mainly) sixteenth and seventeenth century poetry he incorporated into his created world is helpful, and it is likewise gone without a trace. Even worse, this may give some better-informed readers the impression that Eddison was trying to claim credit for literary borrowings he in fact carefully acknowledged. Indeed, Eddison was more than ordinarily scrupulous; he went so far as to specify the variant readings he used in one of the poems.  The Kessinger E-Book is also littered with new and original misprints, which sometimes make Eddison's classical allusions rather difficult to recognize; I assume that this was generated from the same digital version used for the publisher's hard copy edition, which should have the same flaws. However, the e-book is so inexpensive, and the digital form so convenient for searches, that, for now, I am as delighted with it as child with a new toy. *IF* you don't mind reading a computer screen for long stretches (I do), this may not be a bad place to start. (You will need Adobe Reader 6.x or above to view it; and, even aside from the length, forget about printing it; the file is locked.)   Finally, if you are (as is most likely) reading this on-line, you can check a hypertext version of the 1922 edition on the web  -- see the Internet Sacred Text Archive, under Tolkien-related material. This is admirable, but, again, hundreds of pages on a monitor are a  more than a bit hard to read (at least for me), and connection speed could be a problem. You can certainly use it as a sampler, to determine if you are interested. Also, the site offers a CD-ROM of a huge collection of material, including "Worm," and many texts relevant to it (particularly Norse and alchemical), at an extremely attractive price. (Its new 4.0 edition should eventually be available through Amazon.) The site itself includes helpful links.  I am classing the e-book and hypertext versions as third and fourth convenient ways to find out if you like this long book, which some find impossible to read, and others rewarding enough to read over and over 
 I never know what to expect when I begin a new Dick Francis novel - but I always enjoy the ride.  This one is no exception 
 I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended 
 It has all the tunes from the movie. You half to have a open ear though they come from all different styles from rap, Jazz all the way up to heavy metal. Peter Gabriel is even on it. A good assortment of tunes 
 I bought this version thinking it was the real enhanced version, but it wasn't, and I also thought that it would came with the hidden booklet, but same thing, it didn't. Good CD but it's the nornmal version of the real thing 
 The book arrived exactally as described and had the information I expected it to have. It was purchased for a class 
 This is a very good and quite thorough overview of John Hiatt's career, and it certainly gets the nod over "Greatest Hits: The A&M Years '87-'94" and Capitol's "The Best Of John Hiatt", as it is much more comprehensive, featuring some forty songs as opposed to less than twenty on the other two major compilations.  And the third John Hiatt best-of, "Living A Little, Laughing A Little", which focuses on his lesser-known tracks, only includes tracks recorded before 1986.  It is not perfect...very few anthologies are, actually. And "Anthology" misses out on a handful of Hiatt's best songs: The groovy, soulful R&B of "Don't Know Much About Love" isn't here, and neither is the excellent roots-rocker "You May Already Be A Winner", or the sorrowful ballads "Love In Flames" or "Tip Of My Tongue".  But what IS here then? Well, precious few clunkers, that's for sure. John Hiatt is one of the most underrated American composers and lyricists. He draws from both blues, folk, soul, country and R&B, creating a unique, rootsy rock n' roll sound, and these two 78-minute discs are filled with songs ranging from good to great:   Here you'll find the beautiful duet with Roseanne Cash, "The Way We Make A Broken Heart", the poetic and exquisitely melodic "Buffalo River Home" (one of Hiatt's best ever), the wry "Perfectly Good Guitar", the bluesy "Thank You Girl" and "Riding With The King", the superb melodic roots-rocker "She Loves The Jerk", the acoustic ballad "Lipstick Sunset", the tough, straight-ahead rock songs "Child Of The Wild Blue Yonder", "Memphis In The Meantime", "Cry Love" and "Slow Turning", and too many more to mention.  If you're looking for just one comprehensive overview of John Hiatt's 25-year career, I'm afraid you won't find it anywhere (until they give us the box set). But for now, this is the next best thing. And it's pretty darn good, too 
 I truly enjoyed creating one of Norm's pieces in the book, a  "simple" dresser.  Norm is clearly a talented and experienced  woodworker.  This book is not a beginner's guide, though.  I found the lack  of specific, up-front guidance with respect to wood and hardware  requirements annoying.  Instead one has to dig through the text and glean  requirements for oneself.  The overwhelming and almost total use of  expensive machinery eliminates all but the most well-off amateurs from  being able to follow his instructions.  However, Norm is great.  The book  has some lovely projects with full-color presentations and detailed, clear  instructions.  If you've got a wood shop full of professional power tools  and are looking for good projects, this is an outstanding book 
 This book is written for anyone concerned about an older parent, grandparent or other older adult who has a problem with alcohol or mood-altering medications. It is the only book I've found that covers this topic so completely and, not only does it explain the problem clearly, it offers practical steps to help the older person get the right kind of help and live out the rest of their golden years sober -- able to, once again, enjoy family, grandchildren and friends.  Best insight: many of the things attributed to aging can be a result of addiction. With sobriety, many or all of the problems go away 
 SLEEP, PALE SISTER by Joanne Harris November 3, 2005  Amazon Rating: 4/5 Stars  Fans of Joanne Harris, most famous for Chocolat, will be delighted to read this older work by the beloved author, SLEEP, PALE SISTER. Originally published in 1994, it is quite different from her more current novels.  SLEEP, PALE SISTER is a gothic novel, complete with ghosts, evil men and fainting women. Harris' taste for food is not apparent in this novel either.  Basically,  persons reading this book as their first taste of Joanne Harris will not know that this older novel is not typical of what she is known for today.  Whether that is good or bad is left up to the reader.  The novel revolves around two characters, Effie, who is introduced when she is a young impressionable girl, and Henry Chester, who is a much older man, an artist who discovers Effie and falls for her, despite their age difference.  Effie eventually marries Henry, when she is seventeen and he is in his forties, and Effie soon finds out she's made a big mistake.  Henry's ideal woman is virginal and chaste, and the act of sex disgusts him.  What Effie doesn't realize is that having sex with HER disgusts him, because he was attracted to her innocence, but his lust for women is lurking underneath his facade of purity and godliness.    Effie becomes ill quite often, especially after the miscarriage of her baby, and loses her love of life. Henry thinks she's just a typical weak woman, and lets her sleep away her days under the spell of the  laudanum he insists she ingests.  In the meantime, Henry meets Moses Harper, who becomes his protege, and Moses falls for the beautiful Effie.  He's much closer in age to Effie, and notices how unhappy she is.  The two start an affair, a dangerous deed since Henry has never hesitated to punish Effie if he felt she needed it.   Effie in turn meets Fanny Miller, a woman of ill repute who turns to Effie as if she were her own daughter. Fanny has her own secrets, one that includes Henry.  The plot thickens as the four lives become intertwined.   The book is narrated by these four characters, each insisting that their viewpoint of the story is the truth.  Henry insists that he is the one that was misunderstood, and the reader may sympathize with him for maybe a few pages, but as one gets to know him, the worse Henry will appear.    Those who love these gothic novels filled with dark overtones, paranormal beings and ladies in distress, this if for you.  The only complaint I had was that the novel I felt went on a bit too long, but at the same time, I enjoyed getting to know the characters and was very engrossed by the story, eager to know how the book would end.  It's not the typical Harris novel, so old fans be warned!  I enjoyed SLEEP, PALE SISTER a lot and would have loved to have seen Joanne Harris write more books like this 
 James Simon, Dean Emeritus of the New York Law School, has written a seminal work on the history of the early republic, comparing titans Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall--Virginians, cousins, lawyers, and political enemies. What Kind of Nation recounts the struggle between America's first political parties, Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans and Marshall's Federalists, over the future of the federal judiciary and the future of the democratic experiment called the Unitied States.  After losing the 1800 election to Jefferson, John Adams attempts curb Jefferson's Republican influence by filling the judiciary with faithful Federalists. His most influential and lasting appointment was John Marshall as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Over thirty four years leading the Court, Marshall secures the independence of the federal judiciary through brilliant legal arguments and skilled political maneuvering.  In Marbury v. Madison, Marshall led a unanimous court in securing the right of judicial review of the consitutionality of all actions of both the executive and congressional in a case that on the surface was a loss for the Federalists. In deciding the case against Adams' midnight appointments for lack of jurisdiction, Marshall makes the the Supreme Court the arbiter of consitutionality for all time to come. Jefferson had argued that consitutionality was the domain of all three branches of government, and in his Kentucky Resolution he contended that states could determine a federal law to be null and void if it was unconstitutional. Marshall's interpretation stands to this day.  Simon is one of the few scholars who sees Jefferson for what he was, a stalwart party man whose hyperbolic condemnation of his opponents though successful in the short term, was ultimately rejected along with his vision of America. Jefferson saw the United States as a loose confederation of powerful states, all pursuing a bucolic ideal of an agrarian economy that rejected banks, paper money, and all things industrial. Instead, the vision of Hamilton and Marshall, the chief representatives of the Federalists, comes to be. The industrial revolution takes hold in the Northeast and the backward looking vision of the agrarians is finally put to rest after the South's defeat in the Civil War.  In reading What Kind of Country, one comes to realize that Jefferson is not a true progressive visionary. In fact, he is the reactionary in this morality play. Industrialization was the future in the early 19th century; agriculture was the past. Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom, envisioned a country of political freedom but economic and indealistic bondage to the land, which in point of fact, would never allow true political freedom 
 Saw Peter Cincotti live, and was blown away. He and his group are awesome. Tight,crisp,incredible energy and touch. Brought down the house. He can sing too, and has fantastic stage presence. His confidence is amazing, he was telling jokes between sets, one lasting several minutes, and it was hilarious, and enlightening at the same time. I'm in the process of procuring any recorded material of his I can get my hands on. It won't compare to him live I'm sure, but I'm hooked. When's that live CD coming out 
      As opposed to most other reviewers, I couldn't put down this book to a point it made my husband jealous.  The Ground Beneath Her Feet makes you become an instant rock and roll fan.  It made me go back to the time I was "in love" with The Beatles- it carries you along the lives of rock singers as if you were there with them all the time.       Rushdie captures your attention weaving the story using well known music words and at the same time describing people and places so vividly- you feel like you're part of the book.     The book took me sight-seeing through Bombay as though I lived there- (I've never been to India). I would say Rushdie could be compared to Shakespeare and to Ingmar Berman- these are people who have a clear grasp on how to describe human passions, emotions, attitudes.  Their stories touch deep in your heart.      I've read other books by Rushdie - even more recent ones and I like them all, but this one is a masterpiece.  The story of Vina and Ormus won't leave my mind and every rock band I listen to it seems I see Ormus and Vina on stage.     The length of the book- well,to me it could even be longer- I couldn't wait to read the end but at the same time I didn't want it to end.It was like having a multiple orgasm!   I appreciate Rushdie's use of endless lists of adjectives and adverbs, (even though you sometimes have to go back to the beginning of the sentence to remember what it is about), because he thus creates a vivid image of what is really happening, of the light, the smell, the sound of the place and the exact feeling.  I can't wait for my kids to read the book so we can discuss our feelings- a truly well done piece of literature.      
 Based on historical, symbolical, and mythological records and interpretations, Margaret Starbird examines evidence from the Judeo-Christian scriptures and other early writings that supports the claim that Jesus was an essential partner of a time-honoured sacred relationship that was at the heart of his spiritual message. She argues from both a logical and intuitive perspective that the sacred union of Jesus and his bride was the very cornerstone of early Christianity, and the key ingredient for solving many of the ills still faced by Church and Society today.  The significance of understanding and applying the integrated objectives and values of these teachings to both personal and societal practices and pursuits, while maintaining the necessary balance between the two gender-related components, was subsequently lost and distorted by the unbalanced perspective of the male-dominated Church leaders who sought to institutionalize and control the traditions and teachings for almost two millennia. In the wake of this continuous domination, the voice, role and perspectives of women in the Church have become severely curtailed. The Church became the powerful, dominating Bachelor served by the humble, intimidated Maid, rather than a sacred, balanced union of the Groom and Bride in equal partnership. As a result, balance shifted, strict incomplete and distorted interpretations and practices were imposed, and dissent became punishable by imprisonment or death.    Through a careful examination of the disregarded evidence concerning the exiled bride Mary Magdalene and the feminine archetype, Margaret Starbird elevates the reader back to a conscious awareness of what the Church taught in the very beginning - the Sacred Union, and the intimate partnership of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, reflecting the principles of union and love which are necessary to begin the eventual achievement of all levels of personal and societal advancement.  Margaret Starbird's research traces the esoteric origin and development of the Sacred Union or Hieros Gamos wisdom; how it was reflected in the Old and New Testaments; how it went underground for almost two millennia following the patriarchal impositions; how it survived as an underground stream of esoteric wisdom expressed through art, philosophy, literature and religion; and how it continues to struggle into conscious awareness today, as an important archetypal principle, filling and healing the many forgotten voids left in Church and society alike.  Margaret Starbird skillfully brings the principle of the lost feminine archetype back to awareness, restoring Mary Magdalene to the preeminent and intimate position that she once held as the favoured companion of Jesus. She thereby resasserts the forgotten, balanced view of Christianity based on the sacred union as taught by Jesus and expressed in the Gospels. It makes little sense that any responsible rabbi would not teach what he himself did not fully embrace.  For anyone who feels affronted by the continuing reluctance of top male-dominated Church leaders to once again embrace the feminine principle and change the unbalanced, distorted and disrespectful gender attitudes and influences implicit in the administration of many of the institutionalized Christian Churches, and who seeks a healthier, balanced and respectful understanding of the earliest Christian teachings, this well-written and thought-provoking book is one of the most encouraging and sensible on the subject that I have encountered.   The book is written in a style that can be easily understood and appreciated by a man or woman, regardless of the amount of his or her biblical background. It contains 24 colourful, informative plates of Mary Magdalene-related artwork throughout the centuries, a chronology of key events, an index, and a CD which contains an inspirational one hour talk by Margaret Starbird, elaborating on some of the important parts that were raised in the book.   After reading this book, the reader will be inclined to agree with Margaret Starbird that even if Jesus and Mary Magdalene were not intimate partners of a sacred marriage, then in order for the Christian message to be complete and understandable, they should have been.  
 a great book thus symbolic meaning of a child innonece reflects the attitude of a lamb who is humble meek and obebient 
 I began to embrace Ford Johnson's philosophies (garnered from his website) before ever purchasing and reading "Confessions." The difference that the information revealed by Johnson has made in my life is boundless. I would ask a reader to keep an open mind. Ask yourself, "COULD this be the truth?" I think the bad reviews stem from misunderstandings about what this book means to teach. Nowhere can one find a more positive, loving message. 
 - in fact, they do so" --Bertrand Russell   So it turns out that these were good guys after all, were they?  Right on.  If only the (not so?) Yamato People had prevailed.  Peace and harmony, and rule by "fluency in Marxism and Western Philosophy" might have reigned throughout Asia, the Pacific, portions of Oregon, The Bay Area, Southern California, and the Near West Side of Madison, WI.   I dare say that there might have been, and still even remain,  some benighted line of resistance from Tacoma to Anchorage.  College sophomores from D.C. and Oconomowoc might have, in bashful but bold transgression, held hands  with Kamikaze pilots at coffee shops on State Street, and rest assured, 'pro rege et patria NON mori' on the  part of Japanese Imperial Forces would have most certainly  been immediately, decisively, and finally demonstrated,  'Primus Post Laurus.'  I might be impressed if these nutters had been reading The Federalist Papers, James Joyce, or Freud.  But Nietszche and Marx? Sounds like a more or less  predictable fixation with the concerns of The Third Reich to me. At least the Nazis made a few good movies.  When will they ever learn? When will they ev-ver learn. La la.  Japan was and remains, in some ways, a catalog of caricatures -- this perhaps owing to its remarkably unique historical circumstances.   It can be sometimes mesmerizing and sometimes unsettling  in its general intensity and amplitude. Every imaginable  quality of human nature and creativity are brilliantly displayed.   Barring, that is, just those that are taken most for  granted in the West: unfettered individuality and the  casual exercise of personal judgment in the public realm.  One must keep this in mind in order to take in its  extraordinary tapestry without becoming overly  charmed by any of it in its details or particulars.  The contemporary wish, where sincere, to extend the  principles and values of democracy to the sphere of  international relations is to be encouraged.   The attempt to wish any such attributes onto a past  that simply was not so, is suspect.   Call it 'The Cosmopolitical Fallacy,' or, maybe, 'Fantasy.'  Historical parallels to current events  must, as a rule, be made and taken with  all care and judiciousness 
 My Dad bought me this wonderful little book when I was young, & I have always loved the truly off-center humor of it. In response to the query about the meaning of epiplectic, I found a quick online search produced the same type of results as reviewer RHS got--mostly references to epileptic & apoplectic. Oddly, I have a clear memory of looking it up decades ago (one of my father's favorite admonitions was "look it up!") and finding a definition that related it to apoplectic, and described it as referring to something that suddenly and somewhat violently falls to pieces. In fact I have often cited 'epiplectic' as an apt description when watching the Blues Brothers' faithful retired police car burst into bits once they make Daley Plaza, LOL--so this definition, though unconfirmable at the moment, has been clearly emblazoned in my memory for these many years (right or not)! Now if I could just find that dictionary of my Dad's to confirm.. 
 What a great book.  My 17 month old now runs to the stairs to go to bed and asks for "the sleepy book".  The pictures are beautiful, the pages CAN'T tear, and she loves it.  She stands when the giraffe page comes, but sits right back down with the owl.  A nice change from Goodnight Moon which we read for 17 months!! 
 This book is a treasure. I have checked it out of the library several times already and now have finally decided to buy it. I have yet to find a better guide to traditonal painting techniques. In a world of modern  techniques based on 20th century aesthetics, this is the book for those of  us who follow a different path. If you want to paint like Velasquez,  Titian, or Nerdrum, this is the place to start 
 This multichannel SACD is recorded in the front 3 channels only, as this is what the technicians and their top notch analog equipment recorded more than 40 years ago.  At that time the Chicago Symphony and conductor Fritz Reiner were both at the top of their game, and this recording has not been equalled to this day.  Absolutely puts the listener in the middle of the ninth or tenth row, and provides the clean dynamic sound of the best recordings made today!  This is the wonderful Scheherazade I grew up with, but much better because of SACD technology and my current audio system 
 This CD has been in my CD player in 2002. I was so pleased with "NO NO NO". The rest of CD is as good as the hit song. Their voices are mature beyond their years. The songs are uptempo and mid-tempo,the majority of the tracks are ballads. Their vocals are strong enough to put them in the class with En Vogue. This album has been certified Gold back in July 1998. Now, This CD has hit Platinum in sales. 
 To Velikovsky goes the dubious honour of being one of the most flamed authors of popular science literature in modern history. Not half of these flamers deserved their turn. While it is highly unlikely, particularly in hindsight, that Venus several millennia ago was a comet that was sent a-drift in the inner solar system, I believe Velikovsky's Venus theory has been used chiefly as scapegoat.   What makes up the book's core and focus is the element of science and validity in ancient myth. Any modern reader who picks up the Bible and leafs to Exodus will wonder about the events being described there. If it was not a series of actual divine intervention, than what was it? The account is too similar in detail with the symptoms of a great natural disaster to be wholly fabricated.   More importantly: what caused the fairly obvious similarities in myths from all over the world? A language-like trade and distribution? Are their rough contents features of human subconsciousness common to us all? Nobody has the answer. In fact many still stubbornly persist there is no science here at all: myths are made-up stories and wishful thinking.   Velikovsky's "error" was drawing his major conclusions from myth and folklore alone. There was no geological or astronomical evidence to back him up. Instead, he called for these sciences to adapt to his theories. Nevertheless, his method had a logic and clarity that was rudely ripped aside by critics, who wanted to put him on display and eliminate another threat to mainstream scientific thought.   And thus leaving the actual question unchallenged: where is the science and the truth in myth and folklore 
 I found this book very interesting and highly entertaining, not boring at all. Written in short stories, I couldn't put it aside. Great book 
 I recommend this book for anyone who has experienced the death of a close, loved one 
 These are great shoes! The shoes are a medium-to-baby pink and they're very "high style". The shoes run true to size.  The shoes are surprisingly comfortable and I got lots of raves when I wore them to a recent wedding.  They're great shoes at a good price 
 OK Computer was the best thing I had ever heard when I bought it in 1997. Words could not describe how much I looked foward to Radiohead's next CD. When I bought Kid A upon it's realese in 2000, I was utterly disapointed. I listened once, and thought that it was pointless drivel, I turned away from Radiohead. Now 6 years later (and more mature) I decided to try this CD again, and I cannot stop listening to it. I feel it is Radiohead's best CD. The melodies, the profoundness, and the sheer origonality of Kid A is astonishing. As track one suggests, "Everything IS in its right place". It must be listened to in its entirety to be fully appreciated. I am rather happy that I have come to appreciate this music, even if it took me 6 years. 
 This cd is great!!  I have liked the Beatles for a long time, and really wanted something that had a lot of the hits.  My 15 year old son loves it, too.  We fight over it! 
 this is movie not every one will like. it is loosley based on the book by gail carson levine. the movie is about a girl named ella who at birth got the gift of obedenice. ella has to do everything she is told, when she gets fedup she runsaway home to find the fairy who gave her this gift. along the way she meets a elf and prince. this movie is like the wizard of oz meets cinderella

 Kevin MacPherson vs. Lois Griffel's "Painting the Impressionist Landscape?" I've checked them both out, and have done many of the exercises. I am using Liquitex acrylics, which work for both - although a little more difficult with Griffel's techniques.  MacPherson is certainly more explicit and easy to follow; his teaching gives more technical detail and really aims to help the reader become a better painter. It is geared more towards the beginning/intermediate painter (like myself), and is very encouraging.  There are some fundamental differences between the results that MacPherson and Griffel achieve, and this is what should drive you to purchase one book or the other. One cannot compare the luminosity, brilliance and depth of Griffel's work to MacPherson's. MacPherson's limited palette of 4 colors creates a "unified" look, because the paint applied to the canvas will generally need to be a mix of 2 or 3 of his primary colors. He also extensively employs neutral and earth toned mixtures. The price for this is color saturation - mixtures are always less saturated than single pigments applied straight from the tube. MacPherson's work, while colorful, is rather drab compared to Griffel's because of his limited color gamut, and his more traditional technique of layering lights, darks and shadows.  Griffel, however, teaches the use of saturated color straight from the tube, wherever possible. This forces the painter to make discrete choices in the beginning, rather than try to mix a continuum of color, and helps put the focus on seeing, recognizing and choosing colors. The other technique Griffel uses extensively is scrumbling, or the juxtaposition of two pure colors against each other. This is a key technique employed by impressionist painters, and it is also the reason why Griffel's paintings are so much more vibrant. I did find Griffel's palette huge, so I created my own, which provides very high saturation, either alone or when mixing two adjacent colors:  Hansa yellow lt		 Cad yellow med Cad orange Cad red lt Acra magenta Dioxazine purple Ultramarine blue (RS) Phthalo blue (GS) Phthalo green (BS) Permanent green lt  I found Griffel's book much more enjoyable and enlightening, because I liked the wonderful effects I was getting following her simple exercises. I am learning a ton about color choices, value and seeing color. She gives lots of detail with respect to her thought process and how she chooses each and every color. This you will not find in any other book, including Susan Sarback's "Capturing Radiant Colors in Oils," which is based on the same techniques. Painting is reduced to what it is - just putting down one spot of color next to another.  If you like MacPherson's work and prefer a technically detailed, more traditional painting approach, get his book, it is really a great book on how to paint. If you like Griffel's paintings, perhaps already have some painting experience, and are willing to open your mind and experiment, go with her, you won't regret it! 
 I Really love this 4 Play CD.  Of all the 4 Play CDs this is the best 
 For Me And My Gal is my FAVORITE movie so I bought the soundtrack.  I was blown away by how well it was done.  I listen to it over and over again.  Judy Garland and Gene Kelly do an outstanding job as always.  If you're an  old musical fan like me you should DEFINATELY get this CD 
 This book is truly great. It is one of the best books that WWE has released. Mick Foley has a way with words and writing that is very rare. I would recomend this book to any wrestling fan, Foley fan or not 
 Details, details, details - this book is loaded with them, even the less than pleasant ones.  Well written, logical, practical - an excellent book.  It covers everything from getting the chicks to slaughtering the full grown birds and transferring them to the customer.  I look forward to reading the rest of Joel's books about his unique style of farming, and hope for the day when this type of sustainable agriculture will become the norm. 
 I came home from work and got comfy on the couch with this book and some leftover Chinese.  As I read, I could feel my shoulders come down from around my ears.  My breathing slowed.  I peacefully glided through the advice of this book while my psyche responded to the assurance that all was going to be well.  I did not want to put it down to go to bed.  I woke knowing that I was up to the task of getting my stuff in order, and ready to do it.  I went looking for the book, and found it in my purse.  I felt better knowing it was easily accessible.  When I am done, it will live in my night-stand and go with me on trips.  I brought it to work today because as soon as I have a few moments, I will be reading.  It should be titled, "Tweak Your Life Towards Sanity." For those who have never known sanity, you will when you are done with this.  Dr. Kendall-Tackett has delivered more than she promised 
 Call of Duty 2 puts you in the role of three different people - Vasili, John Davis, and Bill Taylor - during three highly intense but different WW2 campaigns.  You see the war through each of these soldiers eyes, so in otherwords, its a first person shooter. Anyway, you get a lot of authentic WW2 weapons which include Panzershreks, MP40s, M1 Garands, Thompsons, etc and you get to shoot and blow up things like Halftracks and Tiger Tanks. Ontop of that, you get smoke & frag grenades to toss around at will. There is a multiplayer which is pretty fun - you pick a team (ie: British, Nazis, Americans..you get it) and go toe to toe with a friend or friends in random places that has WW2 history.  The objectives in each level sually require you to either clear out houses room by room, snipe out mortar teams, fend off a massive German counterattack, or place a bomb on something. Its pretty fun and intense because you'll be fighting off wave after wave of Nazis and artillery while trying to achieve your goal, but it becomes sorta repetitive during the later levels..  I want to stress the word "intense" on this game. You will always be on your toes, always firing at hordes of enemies. This game isn't easy, even on the easy difficulty, and is ridiculously hard on the Veteran difficulty. The hardest in my opinion is the American campaign during the battle of Point Du Heuc... if you think Medal of Honor: Frontline's Arnhem Knights level is difficult, wait till you see this. Also, this game is pretty long so don't try rushing it hah.  Moving on, you'll be fighting in very detailed and wartorn areas such as Egypt, France, Russia, and even Germany. I was impressed with the beautiful looking enviroments when up close, and the character models look amazing. However, the levels feel kind of linear. You are pretty limited as to where you can go, but I guess we can look past that.  The sound effects were great - I really loved the explosions. The voice acting was great, and actually helpful because your allies would be like "Kraut on the 2nd floor, black building" and basically point out enemies to you.  What lowered this game from being a 9? Well for starters its in a genre that has been basically played to death. Ontop of that the guns weren't very accurate nor did some of them seem very powerful. I felt ripped off when I shot a guy with the BAR and he just sort of kelled over, got up and shot me again. Meh. Also, like I mentioned, the objectives started to get repetitive.  The ending was kind of a rip off at first - a simple news reel explaining how the Allies won - but once the credits roll, the real ending begins. It shows a bunch of troops battling it out in some destroyed city againt tanks, nazis, and airplanes. It was like watching a movie.  To sum it all up, if you got an X-Box 360 then you need to play this game. It isn't the best in my opinion, but it sure is a lot of fun. Go buy it 
 It was an easy read and went quick.  I liked the big font and short chapters. 
 When I picked up this book it was because I randomly chose it from a pile of recommendations a friend gave me. I had no desire to read it, and the only reason I actually went through with it was that a) I would have to give the book back someday and b) she always recommends good-to-decent books. And despite the obvious reputation that Goodall has, I still had no desire to read it. Having recently picked up (and put down) Rachel Carson's The Edge of the Sea, I was in no mind to read another nature-based book. That gives you a good indication of my mindset going into this.  I'm glad I was wrong. I enjoyed this book much more than I would have imagined - it's a fascinating read. I say that having had virtually no prior interest in chimpanzee's nor Jane Goodall. I doubt I would have read this book on my own, since there are a million books begging to be read every time I open my eyes. Sometimes you need to go where you don't necessarily want in order to find a jewel.  The title of this book refers to the window that Goodall gets when she observes the chimps over the years. Through this window she gets an idea of how we, humans, have evolved from where we were to where we are. It gives her a glimpse of the similarities - sometimes uncanny - between chimps and humans. This window often leads to observations you can never expect. Goodall's observations and her way with words fully draw you into the narrative.  Goodall writes anecdotally, attempting to illustrate her point with examples of behavior she observes in the field. These instances make the book much easier to read than a pure scientific approach. Through the text you grow to like (and dislike) some of the chimps in the narrative, as well as easily finding yourself drawn into the various elements of (nearly human) chimp behavior.  The thing I find most surprising is that the stories which transpire between the "actors" are just as dramatic as a work of fiction. They say that fact is stranger than fiction. I don't know if I agree, but it can undoubtedly be interesting. It's certainly a surprise how similar the chimps are to us - or maybe it's not, which I guess is one of the points of the book.  If I have to take on the other POV, which I usually force myself to do in an effort to be fair, I suppose I have to say that despite all she has seen, she does at times force the issue that chimps are better than people. One thing I worried about was that Goodall would constantly laud how amazing the animals are and how we humans could learn from them. For the most part, she doesn't do this. From time to time she seems to be on the verge, but she balances it out with fair observations on both sides of the fence.  In all, it is a riveting book that is well-balanced and, to be sure, well researched. Goodall's years of experience no doubt come through with this book, and her ease behind the keyboard is surprising. I did not find this clunky in the normal vein of science texts at all. In fact, it was a smooth read, almost to a word. Granted, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the subject matter discussed in Through A Window is sure to entertain most people who pick it up. Excellent book and highly recommended 
 This CD gives you the early days of "acid rock" straight from the west coast with lyrics that inspire you with the acid vision. Their major hits are there and fun to listen to along with some more obscure but worthwhile tracks. My favorite is "5D" fifth dimension. It comes straight from LSD and illustrates the philosophy behind the acid culture. 
 OMG! I have the Sweet Dreamz Sirena and decided that I have to have her 2 sisters. So with my summer job money I am going to get these twins. They look cool.

 I HAVE READ MY SHARE OF "SELF HELP" BOOKS BUT NONE CAN COMPARE. I FEEL ALIVE!IF YOU WANT TO BEGIN THE JOURNEY CALLED LIFE WITHOUT THINKING THAT YOU CAN CONTROL IT PLEASE READ THIS BOOK 
 This one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even Booth has a heart...well, more so than we already know.  The ending got me, I got misty over it.  Enjoy with someone you love 
 On Christmas Eve in 1914, the first year of World War I, there was an unauthorized truce between the German and the British/French armies. Both sides first agreed to bury the dead, and a mass was held during this brief time. Some soldiers even enjoyed playing football in no man's land.    `Joyeux Noï¿½l' is inspired by a real-life event that really happened on Christmas Eve at the several front lines during the First World War, and presents the material in a pretty orthodox way, employing the well-handled multi-plot device, in which we will witness the joys and the pains of each character: Guillaume Canet as French lieutenant, Daniel Brï¿½hl as German officer, and Gary Lewis as Scottish military chaplain. The cast playing the soldiers are unanimously good, but it is Gary Lewes as tormented military chaplain who is most impressive among them.  'Joyeux Noï¿½l' also has a sub-plot about a beautiful soprano singer played by Diane Kruger and tenor singer (and her husband) by Benno Fï¿½rmann. I don't know to what extent the film generalized these historical events it shows, but I think their love story looks less effective before the more realistic episodes about the solider in trench. Still these songs are beautiful, and so is Diane Kruger (whose voice is dubbed by soprano singer Natalie Dessay), showing the power of the music which is timeless and universal.  But to some viewers (including me), smaller things would remain more strongly in their mind. A stray cat found in trench is given different names by the German and the French soldiers. There is a good-natured French soldier Ponchel, who sneaks out of the trench every night to meet his family living behind the enemy line. There are moments when the film wears its heart on its sleeve, but it is most touching when it chooses not to be so, showing the details of the life under the extreme circumstances.   In spite of its wave of sentimentality, `Joyeux Noï¿½l' does not forget the reality surrounding the soldiers. It surely has some "feel-good" moments that are often seen in the films about Christmas, but it is also about the humans on the battlefield, and you will realize it when you know the fate awaiting them. After all, it was still 1914, and most people must have thought the war would be over soon while we know it finally ended in 1918. The film has a clear, life-affirming message bolstered by moving songs, but the film may look slightly poignant when you imagine how many of them could have survived the war. `Joyeux Noï¿½l' is an inspirational French film with several touching songs, a bit of sadness, and hope, too 
 Beckett's "Krapp's Last Tape" doesn't seem to get the respect it deserves from drama critics because it is always set up against his other works. It lacks the tremendous absurdity of "Waiting for Godot" or "Endgame" but it has its fair share. In some respects "Krapp's LastTape" has much more of a human face than the others: we can understand Krapp much more than Gogo or Didi. And this serves to make him someone with whom we can more easily identify and, therefore, makes him more tragic.  The essential question that this play raises is "Who is Krapp?" Is it the old man we can see on stage? Is it his voice from decades earlier? Or was he the Krapp on the one tape he returns to again and again? Was that Krapp real and then killed and consummed by the bitter man shoving bananas down his throat? Consequently, we discover he is all and none of these. A life is not a static thing; it constantly changes. And, like Krapp, we will either embrace or resent what we do with our lives. This is a terrific play, and, in my humble (and I mean humble) opinion, Samuel Beckett's best 
 I bought this DVD because I'm having a traditional Irish music band perform at my wedding.  I'm not a natural dancer and needed to learn some basic steps.  I was afraid the Jean Butler DVD would be too dificult for me.  This DVD is perfect for my needs.  The steps are very simple but will allow me to move to the music.  It's also a good workout, with all the bouncing up and down.  I gave it 4 stars because the production is a bit amateur.  The editing is poorly done in places.  If you already know Irish dancing, this DVD is way too simple for you.  For the rest of us with an interest in Irish culture, it's great 
 Bought this for two reasons; I love to cook and I want to learn how to cook "Caribbean".  Text is excellent, particularly dish descriptions.  Also, the whats and wheres of the ingredients is great reading and really adds to the enjoyment of this cuisine. Have tried a dozen or so dishes so far and they're all excellent.  Can't wait to try more.  I highly recommend this for lovers of tropical cooking. 
 This is the second book in the series, _A Princess of Mars_ being the first. I like this one better. Again, John Carter astral-travels to Mars, and instantly finds himself in a battle with the plant men, alongside his old friend Tars Tarkas. A new  resourceful female character, is introduced. Surprisingly, Burroughs does a hatchet-job on fanatical mass religion and corrupt priests, which is something I didn't expect in an action-adventure novel [...]. Burroughs is generally an adequate, workman-like writer, but, boy, could he tell a story! This book is just one action-packed adventure after another. And even though Burroughs wrote most of his Mars novels right around 1912, they still hold up today 
 This is the first book I've read out of the Alan Gregory series and I fell in love with it.  I have read many many books but not too many mystery/suspense books.  After reading this book I plan on reading the rest of his series plus other mystery books.  I read this whole book in one sitting.  I just couldn't put it down.  Like other reviews READ THE BOOKS IN ORDER.  I have now read 2 other books out of this series and reading the series in order will be most enjoyable!  READ THIS BOOK.  It will blow your mind 
 I really liked the book but it made me very curious about the author.  Does anyone know who the author is?  I am trying to track him down and not having much luck.  I am wondering about the screen plays he's written ... any made into movies?  What writing award did he win?  Are there other works of fiction available under another name?  I guess I am more curious about the author than anything else 
 This is a FACTUAL and HONESTLY REASONED book.  The negative reviewers obviously didn't really read the book, and are unaqainted with American history.  Their reasons for the bad reviews simply shows they are either completely dishonest, deliberate liars, or complete morons.  Thats about as nice as you can say it when people choose to be wicked 
 Dr. Costanzo is definitely a great teacher.  This book has really helped me out a lot, I've even recommended to all my friends who are planning to go to medical school.  The online feature is a great companion, and for the price, nothing beats it!  If you are a first time physiology student, I recommend this as a supplement text 
  Treasured Friends by Ann Hibbard is one of the best books I have ever read on friendship. It is a Christian based book, and is a book written for women, but I feel no matter what your spiritual beliefs are, you can gain something valuable from this book.   Not only are there lovely and personal stories about friendship, but there are insightful lessons on how to find friends, and how to keep them. The most helpful part of the book for me were the chapters on Dissapointments and Transformations. Having gone through a loss of a life long friend, and after reading many books on friendship, I never really found the right words about the loss and moving on. In reading this book and reading about other women's experience with such losses, I was finally able to put the pieces together and forgive myself and my friend.   So many books focus on romantic relationships and their losses, and so few capture the importance of friendship and the devestation and hurt their losses can bring. This book was a true comfort.   A Treasure that I will read again 
 Margaret Wertheim has an uncanny ability to weave art, science, religion and literature into a solid analysis of culture and it's impact on how we interpret our reality. Her account of the history of our perception of  space is fascinating on it's own, exploring as it does the struggle between  the physical and the spiritual. However, I thought the final chapters,  which examined reasons for the Net's popularity, the possibilities that  people claim for it and the limitations of the virtual world were extremely  insightful and well worth a read 
 Great Stuff!!!!  This book is staggering in the breadth and depth of info available.    This book includes stats, history, profiles of all major leagues around the world, stadium information, history of specific clubs, maps with locations, and more.  If you've ever been watching a game from the Premier League in the UK or the Bundesliga in Germany and wondered about the rivalries, etc... then this book is for you.    We leave this book on the coffee table and pull it out whenever there is a game on TV.  It makes the experience so much more interesting.  It isn't uncommon to come in and see one of the guys leafing through the pages just learning about soccer around the world.  We bought several of these as gifts for our soccer coaches.  Even they were blown away.  We all strongly recommend this book for soccer fans! 
 I purchased this toy for my daughter during the christmas season and she is still playing with it four months later. This toy is energetic and fun and encourages a baby to get moving! I highly recommend this toy 
 There are a lot of eBay books on the market, many geared toward eBay businesses.  Some of them are pretty good, but none comes close to this book.  While there are some honest books on eBay, most are either self-promotional or too vague to really be of any help.  Scot Wingo's book is intelligently written and gets down to the nitty gritty.  Granted, I just recently got a business degree, so I'm on the same level as a lot of his sometimes difficult terminology and concepts.  And it's not easy reading.  But it's the best I've come across--and I've read a good deal of what's out there 
 This cookbook is great for young cooks who are just learning to navigate their kitchens. As a young bride trying to manage that transition from ramen-noodle-eating college student to married woman, I've found this book to be absolutely invaluable. The "Cooking Basics" section at the beginning reads more like a cooking textbook than a cookbook and answers all those nagging little questions that you don't know who to ask (what the heck IS a leek anyway?). I used to put it away in the cabinet after I'd used it, but now I don't even bother. I just leave it on the counter so its within easy reach when I want it next. 
 There are no other words to describe this CD.  God has truly used Yolanda to minister to my soul and heart through her music.  My favorite is "This to Shall Pass".  I was really going through some things at the time I purchased the CD and hearing this song was just a conformation to what the Lord had been trying to tell me.  Praise God!!  I love truly every song on this CD.  Very Very Well Done!! 
 I agree with all the other reviews and use the book almost daily as a F&B director - that additional part I like is they perforated each form so if you do not use the CD Rom, each form can easily be removed from the boo 
 How can such a small massager do big things? The name, so appropriately given, creates goosebumps on your arms as it massages your head. We love to use the Tingler on our boys before they go to bed at night - it has a calming effect and helps go right off to La La Land. Who doesn't love to get their head massaged? To get the most out of it, definately have someone else use the Tingler on you vs. you doing it yourself.  It's way more relaxing and you can focus on how incredible it feels.   Try it, you'll like it 
 This was an interesting book.  It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read.  The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era.  I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time.  I plan on reading several other works by this author.  It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language.  I would recommend 
 This is a another future needlework classic by Helen Stephens!  Wonderfully illustrated with truly unique needlework images. Richly detailed, instructions and comments, a true joy to read and use.  Helen's lessons and ideas are useful for anyone who uses a needle and thread!  Wonderful for the beginner as well as the experienced.     Detailed  explanations of various techniques, use of light and background, are  through out the book. Wether you copy Helen's designs or use it as a  starting point for your own, this book will inspire you to greatness in  your own work 
 I was looking for Solyent Green since I was young after seeing it in theater as a science-fiction drama. Now that I found it, I do not know if I am very happy to see it again considering that it might be closer to reality than to Sci-F 
 i've been seaking health for a long time. since some of my brothers have died because digenerative illnesses. This book brings all the information someone needs to know. I already started following the instructions on the book and I'm feeling already much better. I've lost 5 kilos and I'm taking colonterapy just like advised in the book. Feeling great!!! Best approach for conquering disease ever writen about 
 	There are people who like Lucy. But I am one of many that truly truly LOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVE  LUCY.  I  remember Monday nights waiting for Lucy to come on television.  I thought then and still to this day think she is the funniest and  most brilliant comedian.  The title THE QUEEN OF COMEDY could not fit anyone but her. I remember when the LONG LONG TRAILER came to my neighborhood in Ozone Park, Queens NY.  To see my favorite comedian in color and for well over an hour was a memorable experience for me.  Lucy was my first true love.  Through the years I have watched the I Love Lucy reruns over and over and over. Each time  I see them I laugh like it's the first time.  Through the years I ordered the Columbia House I love Lucy VHS tapes, copied most of them off the TV and then finally ordered the complete I LOVE LUCY collection on DVD.  Bought the VHS version of THE LONG LONG TRAILER. Imagine how excited I was when I found out that it was going to be released on DVD.  I ordered the 3 DVD set immediately. Ah  it was like Christmas in July when it finally came.  Only one other person, a dear friend of mine loves Lucy as much as I do.  We talk Lucy all the time, compare notes and try to stump the other with trivia questions. I know more than my friend does but we still have fun.  So would I recommend the 3 DVD set?  It's priceless and a must for anyone who even remotely likes Lucille Ball.  I cannot wait for the release of Mame.  Sincerely Peter Montana 
  I was in Florence recently, when my eyes came across this book.  I'am no expert in art, history or biography, but this was a great read.  I chuckled often as Cellini vividly portrayed the many adventures of his life.  The one amazing thing about this book is, how real Cellini becomes.  You feel his many pains and triumphs.  Cellini is very normal and flawed, which make him more endearing.  I love the guy and wish he were alive today, cause he's the type of guy you'd enjoy a beer with.  Buy this book.  For everyone 
 Katy is a municipal snow plow serving a small village who is hit by a massive snow storm.  Adults who think it silly that machines are made to behave like people in picture books should remember the little engine that could.  Katy has no doubt that she can tackle any snow, and when a massive snow storm hits, she is called to duty.  The firemen, the police, the doctors, the postmaster, and others all cry out for help from Katy.  When Katy began to tire, she pressed on - she wouldn't stop.  She is the heroine who saves the village.  What makes this book more than interesting is that the author is also the illustrator, which means that there is thought behind these illustrations that they should intertwine with the dramatic plot of the text.  Each illustration shows the trails plowed through the snow by Katy.  With each progressive illustration, the trails become more numerous and complex to where they begin to look like maps.  These illustrations partner nicley with the text to produce an emerging cadence in the dialogue 
 In his 1984 historical novel "Lincoln", Gore Vidal has written with great insight about our sixteenth president, his cabinet, his family, his enemies, and the Civil War Era. Lengthy though the book is, the writing is crisp and eloquent. It held my attention throughout. The book is part of a series of novels by Vidal exploring the history of the United States.  In writing historical novels, it is difficult to tell where fact ends and fiction begins. This is particularly the case in dealing with a complex figure such as Lincoln whose life and political legacy remain controversial and subject to many interpretations. Controversial matters  that Vidal addresses in his novel include Lincoln's attitude towards African-Americans and the Reconstruction policy that Lincoln might have pursued if he had lived.  Vidal's book shows careful study of Lincoln's life and the Civil War era.  He uses the resources uniquely available to the novelist to good advantage by probing the thought processes and feelings of his characters where historical evidence is lacking.  I found the portrait of Lincoln compelling, but it is important to remember that Vidal is writing a novel.  Vidal's book begins as the President-elect arrives secretly in Washington, D.C. a few days before his inaugaration to thwart a feared assassination attempt in Baltimore.  In the course of the novel, passages of recollection by various characters, reliable and unreliable, cast some light on Lincoln's earlier life.  The book moves carefully and slowly, with a great deal of attention given, and properly so, to the earlier period of Lincoln's presidency.  Much attention is given to Washington, D.C. at the outset of Lincoln's administration, to attempts to avert the war, to Lincoln's formation of his cabinet, and to preparing the nation for what proved to be a long bloody struggle.  The pace of the book picks up as it proceeds through Lincoln's first term and reelection, the end of the Civil War, and the assassination.  The picture of Abraham Lincoln that emerges from Vidal is of a man of great intellect, ambition and will, determined to save the Union at all costs.  Vidal portrays Lincoln's overriding dedication to the Union. In order to preserve the Union, Lincoln uses extraordinary and even ruthless political skills. Thus, Vidal's novel considers extensively Lincoln's relationship with his cabinet.  Vidal shows Lincoln choosing a cabinet from among his political rivals for the presidency, as well as from loyalist democrats, in order to be all-inclusive in the war effort.  Lincoln deals with uncanny skill with potential rivals for the presidency, especially Secretary of State Seward and Secretary of the Treasury Chase. (A  recent historical study, "Team of Rivals" by Doris Goodwin also treats Lincoln's relationship to his cabinet at length.)  The book also shows Lincoln dealing with similar finesse and force with the Radical Republicans in Congress, with Chief Justice Taney on the Supreme Court, and with his military leaders.  Vidal tells his story through a variety of perspectives.  Most of the time, the viewpoint is that of John Hay, one of Lincoln's two secretaries, who had detailed and close access to Lincoln throughout the presidency.  Hay and Lincoln's other secretary, Nicholay, together wrote one of the earliest biographies of Lincoln.  Vidal also gives the reader a large portrait of the many southern conspirators against Lincoln.  In particular Vidal develops the character of a young man named David Herrold, with uncertain purpose in life, who ultimately becomes part of the Booth conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln.  Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase and his ambitious daughter Kate also receive a large share of attention in Vidal's novel.  For all the attention lavished on him, Lincoln as a man remains an enigma. Lincoln largely kept his own counsel and was not demonstrative in showing his feelings. Thus fleshing-out Lincoln's character offers the novelist a great deal of latitude, and Vidal makes the most of it.  His novel focuses on Lincoln's difficult relationship with his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, as she spends lavishly, engages herself in political intrigue, and descends to near-madness.  The Lincolns endured the death of their young son Willie during the presidency. Vidal properly gives substantial attention to Lincoln's religious views, which became increasing theistic with the prolongation of the Civil War, but never Christian.  Although Gore clearly admires Lincoln and his fortitude in saving the Union, he emphasizes that Lincoln's success came at a high price over and above the loss of blood and treasure in a long bitter war. With his suspension of habeas corpus and supression of dissent, Lincoln expanded forever the power of the Presidency. The war effort changed the character of the United States from an agrarian republic to a centralized, industrial nation.  At the end of the book, Vidal puts his own misgivings into the words of John Hay, stationed in France after the assassination..  Hay remarks that "Lincoln, in some mysterious fashion, had willed his own murder as a form of atonement for the great and terrible thing that he had done by giving so bloody and absolute a rebirth to his nation." (p. 657)  "Lincoln" is a thoughtful and moving book for those readers wanting to think about the ideals and political processes of the United States and about Lincoln's role in their continuing development.

 Like him or not, Saul Bellow was the twentieth century's most comprehensive documentarian of the secular Jewish intellectual experience in America.  Philip Roth is funnier and raunchier and just as intelligent, but there is something to be said for Bellow's gently mannered style, the methodical serenity in which he mines his academic knowledge to put the chaos of the era hopefully into an enlightening context.    Bellow's avatar in "Mr. Sammler's Planet" is Artur Sammler, an Oxford-educated septuagenarian Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust, supported himself as a journalist, and now rents an apartment from his niece Margotte in the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  Besides occasionally lecturing at Columbia, he spends his waning years coping with the remnants of his family: Shula, his nutty daughter, allowed to hide in a convent to escape the Nazis for the price of being instilled with a Catholic identity; Elya Gruner, his nephew, in the hospital for an aneurysm; Gruner's daughter Angela, a tramp, and son Wallace, a brilliant young man who can't decide on a future for himself, instead submerged in gambling debts and contemplating dubious business schemes.   This novel, published in 1970, is in a sense Bellow's entry into the Space Age, and as such there are several references to the manned lunar missions and a long discussion about the universe between Sammler and an Indian biophysicist named Govinda Lal, whose manuscript Shula has stolen.  It is typical of Bellow the essayist to inject his philosophical musings into a fictional narrative by way of a dialogue between two intellectuals, and it is topical of Bellow the novelist to try to connect Sammler to the era of space exploration by assigning him a friendship with the late H.G. Wells, one of the first people to write about interplanetary travel.   One day a black pickpocket whom Sammler has caught in the act corners him in the vestibule of his apartment building and exhibits his virility as though to assert his superiority over the meek elderly white man, his power to take and do whatever he wants.  While Moses Herzog would have responded by writing a letter to Genghis Khan or some such person, Sammler can do nothing but ponder the sheer absurdity of the human condition and the strangeness of the civilizations it has created.  Invoking William Blake, he regards New York, with its cosmopolitan wealth and social permissiveness fostering a new brand of lawlessness, as a city of "dark satanic mills changing into light satanic mills."    Bellow's novels tend to be thematically very similar to each other--a man, typically Jewish, middle-aged or older, overeducated but underemployed, examines his life through the prism of his current environment--but each marks a recognizable step in the American zeitgeist.  Sammler is not much of a presence in his own novel, let alone on his planet; but he is an important, if minor, component of the figurative Bellow persona, the whole of which is greater than the sum of its parts.   
 John Q. Public is a perfect example of why Amazon should screen "customer" reviews.  It's quite obvious that he never watched this documentary; if he thought EC comics and the HBO "Tales from the Crypt" series were "second rate," then why did he buy and watch this DVD in the first place? It is equally obvious from his other reviews that the sole purpose of his existence is to bash others (apparently he has it in for comic books - perhaps he had a traumatic experience reading Donald Duck as a kid).  As the editorial reviews attest, this documentary is hardly "cheaply done."  Rather than "giving comics a bad name," this show shines a spotlight one of the most influential comic book companies of all time, and examines the controversy over horror comic books in the 1950s.  Like the EC Comics themselves, this documentary is visually innovative, using vibrant montages and spectacular visual effects to highlight the original comic artwork.  It is an exceptional program and highly recommended for fans of the original comic books, the later HBO television series, pop culture or even history buffs 
      I whole-heartedly recommend this masterpiece to the "Da Vinci Code" fans, as well as to anyone who has ever curled up in front of a roaring fireplace to read a good mystery. Robert Feather is all about facts and logic, which might normally make it hard to keep one's fire, lit. But that's not the case with this fantastic story. Each turned page heats up more and more, making the book very difficult to put down.      It's a must read in today's world of religious uncertainty. It takes the reader behind the embryonic scenes of a new kind of Judeo-Christian-Islamic triangle, told in a way that only this author could, considering his background and extensive knowledge of the Dead Sea Scrolls.       As the pages were turned faster I could sense Mr. Feather's jubilant circumspection of the findings, which lead to this testament about missing (and perhaps deliberately hidden) links, within the corpus of those three religions.  It's the stuff of Secret Societies and it may even be telling us where the bodies are buried!  Until now, only by being a member of a select group or two, could one come to the same conclusions which Mr. Feather offers up for consumption by anyone who merely takes the time to read. "The Secret Initiation of JESUS at QUMRAN" is an easy and enjoyable path to enlightment. 
 After churning out psychedelic sludge with Vanilla Fudge, bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice joined the blues-rock gold rush of the early '70s. Entertaining in a Spinal Tap way, Cactus spew fantastic riffs as strutting metalhead Rusty Day plays badass frontman. "Rockout, Whatever You Feel Like" is a best song of the ages.best album in years fantastic best as it gets 
 My 5 year old sleeps in this on the weekends. It is very durable. We've had it for a long time.  To the ones who said it won't go up or collapses easily...YOU DIDN'T ASSEMBLE IT CORRECTLY.  It folds up nicely under the bed and it expands so well that it's a bit difficult to move through the hallway. Luckily it's bendable. I don't know about playing in it though. It is kind of small unless it's for a 2 year old or younger. Our son only sleeps in it 
 For the price, The New Penguin Russian Course: A Complete Course for Beginners is a must buy.  This complete guide to learning the Russian language gives you more 'bang for the buck' than any other in its category. In fact, the only true drawback to the book is that it is just that.  'Just a book'. In order to truly learn to speak any language, including Russian, you first need a good quality CD course. My research shows that Behind the Wheel Russian goes very well with The New Penguin Russian Course , providing you with the audio equivalent to what is taught in the text. 
 Kaplan is a genius. He is well versed in Jewish Mysticism and the Kabbalah. A must read for all faiths as it is the fondation of all that is. Although some of Kaplans work is way beyond the PHD level in his writtings such as the book of formation. He offers diverse styles and intellectual levels. Someone is bound to find his writings they can relate too and understand. Meditation and the Kabbalah is an easy read but she read over time for the reader to truly enjoy the teachings. Kaplan does not write science fiction where you could read the book in a summer afternoon. He wants you to think. That is his gift.  
       After reading the reviews below I am prone to wonder how many of the frothy critics of this book actually read it.  Even from the far left (the ever stalwart supporters of all those who hate America) I hear the droning mantra bewailing the supposed characterization of Islam by the extreme acts of an anomalous few.  But Spencer does not make such a characterization.  Most of this book does not examine the actions of extremists but instead the tenets of Islam itself.  His conclusions are well reasoned and documented; and horrifying!  If you have ever wondered why the millions of "peace-loving" Muslims have not condemned en mass the Jihadists who spew hatred and spill the blood of innocent people all over the world, then get this book and find out.  Spencer concludes that violence is a natural outgrowth of the intolerance taught by Islam.  Of course, many of us were taught the myth of Muslim tolerance, yet the Quran famously commands any faithful Muslim to "Slay the Unbelievers wherever ye find them. Seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them? (Quran 9:5)  It is a verse that is not lifted out of context or a rare anomaly or mitigated by the larger body of teaching (as the nonviolent verses of the New Testament clearly abrogate the descriptions of violence contained in the Old Testament) but, is in fact, only one of many such incitements to violence.  Spencer believes that such violent leanings are endemic to Islam and that they explain the complicity of silence we see from the Muslim world when innocents are murdered by Jihadists.         Spencer also deals fairly with the perennially festering topic of the Crusades.  It is bizarre and questionable that any present day political ideology should be driven by events that took place a thousand years ago.  What's more, I wonder why so many Westerners collapse into a guilt coma at the mere mention of the Crusades without asking some important questions.  How did the ancient birth place of Christianity, the stomping grounds of the Apostle Paul, St. Augustine, and the incubator that produced the creed most Christians repeat on Sunday mornings become Muslim in the first place?  It was the result of Muhammad's wars of conquest which lasted almost a thousand years that swallowed the birthplace of Christianity and then stomped out the light that once burned so brightly there.  The Crusades were a belated, misguided, and often ignoble response to hundreds of years of Islamic "crusades."  That march of brutal Islamic imperialism and colonization in the name of Allah ended at the gates of Vienna on a date that should mean something to the world: September 11, 1683.  To be a good Muslim is to long for the renewal of that conquest of Europe and the West.        Spencer explains many of the draconian and intolerant beliefs of Islam without the incoherent contortions that Islamic apologists give to such issues as the sickening mistreatment of women and girls or the Nazi-like (complete with yellow patches on the clothing) Dhimmi status (a form of slavery) required of Christians and Jews in Muslim lands. Some treatment is also given to Muhammad, who, had he lived today in any modern western nation would be considered a pedophile due to the fact that his eleventh (and favorite) wife was 6 years old when they married and 9 when the marriage was consummated (the loving husband was 52.)  That's really not very much like the historical Jesus, which is one of many examples where the moral equivalency between Christianity and Islam touted by the left crumbles in the light of inconvenient facts. Spencer is required reading for people seeking the truth about Islam and the emerging conflict which will likely define the 21st century. 
 Commodify your Dissent is a collection of essays from the Baffler magazine.  The essays are social critiques of Mass Media and corporate and consumer culture.  They have the sarchastic and hilarious style of H.L. Mencken and, like the latter's work, they end up exposing many false 'truths'. The quality of the writing is excellent, i became extremely envious.  My favorite section was The Culture of Business and the critique of businees literature. there are also critiques of commercial grunge music, packaging of artists (one of my favorite essays, exposes pretentious writing for what it is), elites and youth consumerism.  You'll learn and laugh. I enjoyed this book so much that I bouught other titles from Thomas Frank and subscribed to the Baffler 
 With so many reviews posted, I'm reluctant to add one more, but I do want to add my voice to the cheering section.  I ordered this DVD after seeing the video several times.  I just want to keep it in my collection with the current technology.  I've also watched The Tracker, another great movie that stars one of the main characters in Rabbit Proof.  With Rabbit Proof, I cry in the same place each time (and I'm no cry-baby).  But the movie is educational... and you'd have to be in mental coma not to be moved by it.  I am so inspired by it, that Australia is the destination of my next foreign trip 
 Connelly really brings the characters to life.  The farther into you get, the faster you want to turn the pages 
 This early Paul Schrader effort is as slick--and vapid--as the city in which it's set, yet still strangely compelling after all these years. Richard Gere delivers his usual flat performance as the titular character, a walking billboard for all that's wrong with style over substance; here, though, his monotone facial expressions and speech actually work, as the character has the emotional range of his condo's designer furniture. Ironically, model-turned-actress Lauren Hutton delivers a surprisingly steady and honest performance as his love interest, despite having to utter lines that often barely rise above soap-opera level in quality. But the real star of the film is the production itself. The visual and aural model for what would become "Miami Vice," the film still seems modern, crisp, and glossy, even with the poofy hairdos, micro-shirt collars and tinny hatchback cars. The story is little more than fluff; Gere's Julian is framed for murder, and Hutton--the wife of a bigwig politico with much to lose if their affair is discovered--is his only alibi. In a half-hearted attempt to infuse some much-needed moral fiber, Schrader forces Julian to confront the many people he's wronged, as well as the empty but expensive lie that is his life, including hints at the character's bisexuality (controversial stuff in 1980). Despite Hector Elizondo's caricature performance as a Columbo-esque detective and the fact that the film celebrates being shallow as much as it condemns such behavior, it scores some hits, not the least of which is the breezy opening song by Blondie 
 	The third Book of Ember is out! Prophet of Yonwood is a prequel to The City of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau. It explains how everybody wound up in an underground city in the first place. 	Prophet of Yonwood starts with the story of eleven-year-old Nickie goes down to Yonwood with her Aunt Crystal who, along with Nickie's mother, inherited Greenhaven, Nickie's Great-Grandfather's house. They are going to fix up the house to sell. Nickie wants to keep the hose, not sell it, so she draws up a to-do list. She must keep Greenhaven, fall in love and do something to help as it badly needed it. The U.S. and the Phalanx Nations are pretty much arguing but people are worried that this could lead to war.  Nickie spends a lot of time alone in the gigantic house because Crystal is often out running errands. Nickie goes exploring around the house and finds an old photograph of the first Siamese twins Chang and Eng. She also finds a closet and in it she finds a seventeen-year-old named  Amanda and her dog Otis. Amanda tells Nickie about Yonwood starting with Althea Tower's fiery vision.  Althea went into her backyard when her vision hit her in the head like a speeding train she fell over and beheld the sight of a world burning in destruction. Althea has since been staying in bed. Her neighbor, Brenda Beeson, has been taking note of Althea's mumblings so as to take action. She believes that Althea's vision is a glimpse into the future, which could be coming soon what with the conflicts with the Phalanx Nations.  Allegedly, whatever Althea says must be done in order to prevent her vision from becoming a reality, such as when she muttered "no singing" and all radios Cud's and such were all done away with and those who failed to comply would be punished with an indestructible bracelet hums constantly, people go crazy over it.  Amanda becomes Althea's live-in caretaker and decides to leave Otis in Nickie's care.  Nickie meets Brenda and, in an attempt to accomplish her goal to help the world, she help Brenda find wrongdoing so that they can "build a shield of goodness"  as Brenda said. Nickie finds a boy who keeps snakes in his shed and informs Brenda of him. Nickie also meets a boy her age named Grover, he is interested in herpetology, she then realizes that he is the boy she told Brenda about. They become friends, but one day  Grover is ambushed with a bracelet so he goes out in the woods to hide. Nickie feels ashamed of herself and asks Crystal about the difference between right and wrong and realizes that Brenda is wrong. Nickie then goes to the Althea's house and yells at her asking wht=y she said all of the things she said, Athea "wakes up" and then aks what has been going on, Nickie tells Althea about all of the things that have been happening since her vision and Althea explains to Nickie that she was descrin=bing her vision which kept coming back to her. In her vision there were no lights no singing and no dancing. 	All the while Brenda misinterpreted Althea and had, instead preventing her vision, creating it.Out of frustration, Brenda decides to study theology at home to find out what god is really saying. Nickie goes home to the city and is greeted with the good news that she, Otis her Mother and Father will be moving to California. The couple that wanted to buy Greenhaven withdrew their offer and Crystal moved there with her new husband and had two children. The conflicts between the U.S. nd the Phalanx Nations were resolved but started up again many years later. A city was built underground and a select few were allowed into it. Nickie being the daughter of one of the builders was taken in, she was sixty years old. The city would be called Ember.  	I like how this book was told from two different viewpoints. This wasy the reader gets to see in two different places with two different people.  The reader also gets to hear two different sides of  a similar story and two different opinions. Often in stories told in third person limited to one main character the reader only gets to hear one opinion which gets smusheed in your face as if to say "this is what you need to think!" but that was not the case in this book. I also think it's interesting to see both points of view when two people are making friends with each other because the reader to gets to see what they both think about each other and  what they both thought of time spent together.  	I alos liked how this book showed how people are affected even when conflict doesn't become war and how the situation affects everybody. When Crystal and Nickie wanted to take the train, they couldn't because it was shut down for security purposes and when they left the state they hat to be searched, 	Another thing I liked about thi book was that it showed how information is misinterpreted so often, especially God's word. Everyone was convinced  Althea was delivering God's word when realy, it was just her describing the glimpse of the horrible future. Of course part of the reason she was misinterpreted in the firest place was because there was international conflict, the people needed to believe that there was something they could do to protect themselves, because everyone was so on edge, few people considerd how unreasonable everything was.  	My main reason for liking this book was that, in spite of all, there was a happy ending and Nickie got everything done on her to-do list. The people who were buying the hoyse withdrew to offer and Nickie went to visit her Aunt there in the sumrtime so she essentialy got to keep Greenhaven. She fell in love at Yonwood, not with a person but with Otis, her dog. She got to help the world because she sold her icture of Cheng and Eng and sent the money to Grover. He went to a herpetology gathering and this led him to his career in herpetology, and he went on to discover a powerful painkiller in snake venom.  I really like this book very much, I have already read it twice I would also recommend the redt of he series  as it is very good as well 
 Guarding Tess is a pretty good comedy drama that becomes a fair suspense drama by the end.  Nicolas Cage (Matchstick Men) plays a Secret Service agent in charge of guarding an obstinate former first lady, first widow Carlisle, played by Shirley MacLaine (The Sheepman).  Cage wants out of the job to move on to a more important / exciting assignment, but MacLaine bends the ear of the current President to keep him.  Arguments between the two are amusing and interesting as they each maneuver to get their own way.  Cage insists on following rules to the letter to try to irritate her into releasing him - but she always seems to have more power.  The supporting cast includes Edward Albert as Mrs. Carlisle's son, and Austen Pendleton as the driver who's with the first widow .. when ... she ..... disappears..... 
 _The Oxford Companion to the United States Supreme Court of the United States_  (Kermit Hall, ed.) is a massive tome containing a vast swath of information: cases, traditions, theories of constitutional interpretations, historical events, and biographies of all of the Supreme Court Justices.  It has the same material (word for word) as Kermit Hall's _The Oxford Guide to United States Supreme Court Decisions_ but this is much more worthwhile reference work because it contains more contextual material than the cases themselves.  This book is by no means exhaustive, but it provides a very informative overview of what the Supreme Court has been up to for the past two hundred years and the very different personalities serving on the body 
 The work world presents unique challenges for working women.  Learning to navigate the new terrain is explained with great panache by Nicole Williams. I discovered many things about myself, my career and my life! A must read for women in business 
 Doctor who materialised without his Tardis on this, my first timelord download in the amazon unbox, which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside.  For a very reasonable sum, $1.99, my family and I were able to enjoy the first Third doctor adventure after his regeneration, where he encounters the Nestene Conciousness.  The down load took only a few minutes although I had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program. thanks to the good people at amazon tech support I was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental.  a great experience and will not be the last. easy to navigate and fun for all the family. someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis' 
 "Walkabout" is a film directed by Nicolas Roeg (The Man Who Fell to Earth), and is frequently considered one of the greatest films ever made. Having just finished my first (and definitely not last) viewing of it, I must agree. The film is an incredibly unique, visual poem, that is truly a beautiful sight to behold. The film begins with this:  "In Australia, when an Aboriginie man-child reaches sixteen, he is sent out into the land. For months he must live from it. Sleep on it. Eat of its fruit and flesh. Stay alive. Even if it means killing his fellow creatures. The Aboriginies call it the WALKABOUT.  This is the story of a Walkabout"  The story goes like this. A man drives his two children into the harsh Australian outback. He has a teenage daughter and a much younger son. None of the characters are given names, the credits reveal them as  Girl and White Boy. The girl is played by Jenny Agutter, the son by Lucien John. The children are under the impression that they are driving all the way out here for a picnic, but soon their father begins inexplicably shooting at them. After he misses them he pours gasoline on the car, lights it on fire, and shoots himself in the head. The Girl and the Boy don't waste time crying or screaming at the sky "WHY!" like people in a lesser film would do. Instead they try to find their way back home, armed only with some cans of fruit and an AM/FM radio. After a few days of walking through the outback, completely out of any source of water, they meet a young Aboriginie boy (David Gumpilil) who's doing his walkabout. Since the Aboriginie and the two sibilings don't speak the same language, there's definitely a language barrier they have to get past...Obviously they don't, but they find their ways of communicating things like "water" and such. For a movie that spends about 85 minutes of it's 100 minute running time in the desert with little to-no dialogue (none of it really furthers the plot any), this is truly a one-of-a-kind work of art. I know some reviewers (including Roger Ebert, who's responsible for me even hearing of this film) reveal the fate of the Aboriginie boy, I'm not going too. It's much more effective if I don't. In most of my reviews of movies that are deemed "important films" I usually grade the film on it's importance and it's entertainment value. This is definitely an important film, one that people definitely need to watch. As for entertainment, I can't answer that. This film transcends that word. You can't call it entertaining, it really doesn't have the qualities of an entertaining film; But it's not dull or boring either. On another note, many people talk about how the film is suitable for both adults and kids. Despite the fact that it contains both full-frontal nudity (of both genders) and violence, I think some of the most Conservative parents in the world wouldn't mind letting their kids watch this. Both the nudity and violenced is handled in such a humane and realistic way, it's really handled just as a thing of life. I don't want this review to be too long, so I'm going to try and wrap it up real quick. This is a beautiful, haunting, extremely well written and well acted film. It's not just a film that "movie buffs" will enjoy, but people who rush out to see "Resident Evil" could potentially like this film. Seriously, do not miss this movie.  GRADE:  
 I listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away, it is a find!  Nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places, like news readers.  I loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book.  I also liked that the story was partly done in first person.  The main character initially doesn't seem to have much to offer the world.....  Anyway, there are others who have diagramed the story, I just wanted to say, I enjoyed it and the way it was presented in audio version. 
 It is no wonder this book comes to the top of the most popular life coaching books.  It is fabulous and a must read for coaches and trainee coaches.  Curly Martin has captured the essence of life coaching in an easy to read and straightforward to apply way.  I highly recommend this book, it is inspiring, enlightening and a pleasure to read.  Martin offers technique after technique combining the skills of Neuro Linguistic Programming and coaching in an effective and clear manner.  She covers how to set up a coaching practice, how to promote your practice by marketing and referrals, there are graceful models to follow which are really flexible and you know that Martin has used them herself.  If you are a life coach or thinking of becoming one this is, in my opinion, the best buy.  It certainly is top of my coaching book list! 
 i really liked this book.  i read a lot of theology and it is rare to find a book that hits that experiential note without it being sappy or weak theologically.  the book sort of has a blue like jazz flavor to it but it has more of a foundational ground and agenda.  in blue like jazz, rick mckinely is "pastor rick says..."    it was cool to get to know pastor rick and his friends in reading "Jesus in the margins" but even more so it hit a chord with me because the Jesus he presented made a lot of sense.  so often i get the feeling that people think christianity is a religion and Jesus is our god who makes the rules.  this book presents a different Jesus, one is even though he is God, loves to hang out with sinners and isn't afraid to break the rules.  i understood something about Jesus that i never quite have in the same way before reading it...that Jesus knows what it feels like to be on the outside and that he went outside those boundaries for a reason.  for me and for other screw-ups.  the book gives theological feet to a mission mindset that cares more for sinners than arguing over trivial things in some sort of christian club.  
 This is one of the newest Christmas classic movies but it's earned its spot as one of the best Christmas films.  The jokes are hilarious, the acting over-the-top (but this type of film requires it I think) and the storyline brilliant.  This is a must for every family.  It's classic 
 This is my favorite Robben Ford recording.  The tunes are invigorating, original, and the vocal cuts are incredible.  This is the one CD I would take if stranded on an island 
 Quit Your Day Job is inspiring.  I couldn't put it down 
 Ms. Rowland does a great job answering just about every question imaginable when it comes to dealing with your 401K plan. There is advice for getting started,switching jobs, planning beneficiaries, actually retiring, taking loans out against your 401k...everything.  The book is written in a series of 2 page articles she lists as "steps" so if you want to skip around you can.  While a little of the material is dated as a result of the recent tax changes, it is mostly in regards to amounts an individual is able to contribute.  I felt I was fairly knowledgeable on this topic before I started reading but I found it pretty interesting and worth the time 
 I don't know about you, but to me, that just made it to my 50th birthday, watching this movie was like my second chance of being there (I lost the first one because I was under age and lived on the other side of the world). If you like rock and want to know or remember the scene of the late sixties and the early seventies, well, you can't miss this train 
 In Forever Odd, one of Dean Koontz's most endearing characters returns to face new perils, following the trail of a kidnapped friend and dicing with death in a derelict gambling resort. Odd Thomas is his gentle, quirky self once more, communing with the ghost of Elvis and finding himself terrorised by scary cat Terrible Chester. I found this latest outing good but not quite as gripping or significant as the first novel, with a villainess who is more frivolous than menacing. Hopefully, the bad guys will be back on form in Brother Odd, the next book in this intriguing series 
 I have been researching the Middle Ages for a number of years and this is one of the most even -handed books I have come across.  The authors are researchers par excellence, and have presented their findings in an  imminently readable form.  If I were not already a student of the Middle  Ages, however, I might have found the wealth of detail somewhat  overwhelming and some of the terms and references obscure.  This is a book  for people who really want to know 
 I remember buying this book when it hit the market, and now I'm buying it for others in my family to read.  I'm sixty now so I've had plenty of time to see lots of games and manipulation, some of which I got pretty good at myself.  No blame or shame involved.  Most families pass down their learned ways of coping to the next generation so this stuff has always been going on.  As I age I am very much less interested in other's games or even my own.  Victims, tears, blame, "you caused my problems" I just leave to their owners.  Life is too full of fun to be manipulated or guilt-tripped by anyone, and I do believe in total responsibility for my life and what happens in it.  Read this and forgive yourself for your games and unplug from other's attempts to control you by any means they can.  This book is one of my favorites!  Recommended reading for those in the pangs of guilt from anyone, even parents or children 
 Condoleeza Rice was one of the members of the Council of Foreign Relations back in 1988. That seems in line with the author's contention that members of the CFR occupy the prominent positions in government. 
 I am still reading the book, so I will not give a review as such, just a couple of comments. So far, about 150 pages into the book, I find it extremely interesting and quite informative, Harvey manages to keep you turning the pages and the way he presents history already familiar to some of us is like we are seeing it for the first time. There are many facts (about Bolivar) that are new to me, and present the man for what he was, a human being, rather than the god we were taught about in school in South America. My main complain is that the text was not very well edited prior to publication, there are quite a few names misspelled ( Atanasio Girardot, Ricaurte, and others) as well as obvious errors in some dates. Hopefully such mistakes will be corrected in future editions. Overall I can overlook such silly errors and enjoy a truly great book, I am looking forward to Harvey's book on Captain / Admiral Cochrane which is already in my home library shelves 
 I picked up this novel when a couple of friends recommended it.  Usually I am wary of first-time authors that I have not heard of, especially when you are paying for the hardcover!  It ended up being the best money I've spent towards entertainment lately. Philip Donlay's fully formed characters and plot meshed together to create a debut that is certain to make other authors in the genre very nervous.  I would compare this book to works by Michael Crichton. It is full of interesting science and aviation details that adds to a unique and credible story line. The last few chapters were extremely intense - don't pick this book up late at night 
 I read Pamela Redmond Satran's "Babes in Captivity," and enjoyed it, but I thought this was even better. For one thing, the plot was much tighter, and filled with fun twists and surprises.  This is the story of Alice Green, a dowdy, 44-year-old housewife in  suburban Homewood, New Jersey. Alice has always looked young for her age, though she hasn't bothered with her appearance for a long time. She's married to a dentist, who leaves her for his hygienist. Then Alice's daughter leaves for Africa, leaving Alice alone.  In the year following her husband's departure, Alice whips herself into shape by working out for a couple of hours a day. When she tries to re-enter the workforce, she is less successful. She tries to get a job at the publishing house where she worked before she had a child, but they dismiss her as dried-up and middle-aged.   After Alice tells a gypsy that she wants to be "younger," Alice's best friend gives her a makeover. With her gray hair dyed blonde and her newly fit body on display in tighter, more fashionable clothes, Alice decides to give the work thing another try. She returns to Gentility after taking all the dates off her resume and omitting the years she spent as a stay-at-home mom. She also goes to a bar and meets a young man named Josh.  What makes the novel work is not only the riveting plot, but Satran's careful look at the ups and downs of being young and old. She doesn't portray youth as a perfect haven, but instead shows how the "young" Alice must deal with an overbearing boss who doesn't take her seriously. She shows the pressure that the young women at the publishing company feel to get married and have kids before they're 35.   Alice's relationship with Josh is a little less plausible. After he sees her naked, he still thinks she's 29, and can't tell that she had a kid! It's hard to believe that after having a child she wouldn't have stretch marks or something.   However, Satran follows Alice's deception mostly smoothly from beginning to end, and it makes for very engaging reading. 
 When I first started making jewelry 7 years ago, this was one of the first books I bought.  Intended as a textbook, it's a good, basic, easy to understand book for the novice jewele 
 I'm Kim Possible's biggest fan! I got it because It has her in her mission outfit,and she looks the best in it,with her long red hair down 
 The main character of this book,15-year-old Harvey, is one year older than I am, so I am in a unique position to know that he was very fortunate to be taught the life lesson he learned. I know some people who would benefit from this lesson. This book tells of a story where arrogance must be tossed overboard to survive the challenges of life. Harvey learned about that the hard way. It paid off tremendously. He finally appreciated his parents instead of torturing them emotionally. He learned how to fish and to earn his keep. Harvey became a genuine person to his father, to his mother, to the crew on the We're Here, and to himself. Perhaps you should read Captains Courageous, too 
 Jay Conrad Levinson has done it again, this book is great if you do not have alot of time or inclination to read alot of books on marketing.  This book condenses much of what you need to know to effectively market your products ro services in a compact package.  I highly recommend this book if you need ideas and tips that work.  
 Finally a very comprehensive shark tooth identification book that covers over 85 species and covers them correctly. I found very few mistakes of any kind in this book when it comes to ID, nicknames, ages, localities, etc. which is almost never done!  Each identified species shows accompanying photos (several of each species showing different positions usually) and is written in plain English so it can be easily understood by amateurs.  Plus it's small size will enable it to be well-utilized in the field unlike most ID books 
 Disney doesn't disappoint!! This is a nother wonderful Disney adventure that you will enjoy! 
 Exactly what we looking for..nice sounding arrangements of great music 
 How good? Well, as soon as I finished reading American Gods I didn't immediately turn back to Page 1 and start reading it again (I have only ever done this once), but I did immediately go online to see whether Anansi Boys, the sequel, was available in paperback yet. It wasn't. I'm going to have to wait, dammit! :-) But I was completely absorbed from start to finish and will be re-reading it again very soon.  Prior to reading American Gods I had only seen the concept of 'gods among us' explored by Douglas Adams in his Dirk Gently books, where it is treated realistically and handled with dignity by Adams' deliciously humorous prose. Neil Gaiman takes the concept further, exploring the ramifications of multi-cultural pantheons (having been introduced to the New World by assorted multi-national settlers) trying to get by in modern America, and the problems arising therefrom, in a completely realistic way: I could imagine everthing in American Gods actually happening, which I didn't with Adams.  The focus on roadside tourist attractions strongly reminded me of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, but Gaiman's attendent observations and extraordinary attention to detail struck me as being much more personal and direct.  The story is told largely through the experiences of Shadow, a mortal who finds himself working for one of the American gods and having to come to terms with their perspective on life and approach to doing business. In the end, of course, his involvement in events is critical to their outcome.  Like watching The Shawshank Redemption, American Gods is a story that unfolds, rather than a series of scenes staged for effect, and in this respect I cannot praise it highly enough. I found it a thoroughly engrossing read on all levels, immediately earning itself a place in my all-time top ten novels 
 Don't let the grisly climax fool you. This may be one of the most humane movies on record. These are real side-show "freaks" and no matter how distubing, using anything less would have produced a real travesty. Of course, watching this array of human deformity takes some getting used to-- the pin-heads, the human torso, the truncated man, the human toothpick, the dwarves, and all the others. But once you get past the revulsion,  there's fascination, then compassion, and finally (I think) normal acceptance. They are, after all, as human as the rest of us, and it's to Browning's everlasting credit that he leads us through such stages without pity or condescension. The real monsters, of course, are the two pretty people who show their inner deformity by abusing these human unfortunates.   Not everything, however, is praiseworthy. Trapeze artist Baclanova and her strongman  overact shamelessly. Their hammed up gestures almost bring down the entire proceedings, and  I can't help wondering why Browning let them get so out of hand. Also, chronic stutterer Roscoe Ates, whose speech problem is not really so funny when you think about it, is put to dubious effect as comic relief. But these are small potatoes when contrasted with the unique overall effect.  What really surprises me is that this movie curiosity comes from the unlikeliest of sources, Louis B. Mayer's MGM. This so-called Tiffany of studios always prided itself on pretty people, big rooms, and wholesome entertainment. No wonder they pulled the film and stripped off their logo after seeing the on-screen result. This is a long, long way from Andy Hardy and Carverville, USA. I gather it was Irving Thallberg, head of production, who pushed the project over Mayer's objections. Perhaps it was the precarious state of his own health that gave him the compassionate drive necessary to complete such a dubious oddity. Nonetheless, whatever the source or reason, this is truly a one-of-a-kind movie experience and not to be missed 
 This is the seventh novel in the mystery series featuring Marcus Didius Falco, an informer and sleuth in Rome at the time of Vespasian. A series of books that have become hugely popular, so much so that the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers. It was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements  that would be and should be found in  the Roman world of circa AD70, but to have a lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day New York cop. In this the seventh novel Falco and Helena Justina almost seem like long lost relations to the reader.  Time to Depart the title of this latest offering from Lindsey Davis is quite a poignant phrase. If a Roman citizen committed a crime they were not confined to prison but in the true sense of the words they were given time to depart from the Roman Empire and very few were ever allowed to return. Exile was considered to be the worst punishment possible for a Roman. Falco is on the quay at Ostia. "It is Time to Depart" for one of Rome's most famous criminals and Falco and his friend, Petronius are there to see that it actually happens.  In this book  Lindsey Davis has allowed Falco to remain within the confines of his beloved Rome. Working with his oldest friend Petronius Longinus, Captain of the Aventine Watch. There has been an outbreak of robberies and murder in the city and Falco and Petro pool their resources to try to get to the bottom of them. At the same time Falco is looking for a new place to live for himself and Helena. He believes that in a few months time their old apartment will not be big enough for the

 I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT IN MY EARLY THIRTIES WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH PRE-ALGEBRA. I JUST RECEIVED MY MATH SHARK TODAY AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT REALLY GIVEN IT A CHANCE, SO FAR I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IT IS NOT VERY  CHALLENGING FOR ADULTS, BUT SHOULD BE A WONDERFUL PRACTICE TOOL FOR YOUNGER  KIDS AND TEENAGERS. I DO RECOMMEND THE MATH SHARK TO KIDDIES WHO ARE HAVING  PROBLEMS WITH BASIC MATH SKILLS 
 I have to say that about 3 chapters into this book I didn't think I was going to make it through...and then it got really interesting. This is Janis' story told from the perspective of a family member, her sister. One of the most intriguing things about this book is the transformation of the author's point of view. This isn't something that's completely evident at the beginning, but it slowly unveils itself throughout Laura's writing process...and very eloquently as well. She did a magnificint job of pulling together the right resources in order to constantly remind the reader that Janis' life wasn't about her death at all. Rather, it was a series of high and low events that unfolded given the influences of the times, as well as the pressure and awe of stardom. The letters from Janis give the reader a more detailed look into her thoughts and feelings, as well as a very affective gauge in which to see where she was in terms of her addictions and feelings. In addition to this, being a child of the 80's, it was wonderful to read about all of the sociological change that was going on during that time. I learned a great deal about the beat and hippie generations, drug use and abuse at that time, and about what stardom represented during then as well. It left me wanting to hear more Janis, and to read more biographies that have been written in the same manner.  
 This is one of the best CDs I have heard in years!  The singing is lovely but not overdone, and the selection of songs is impeccable!  I highly recommend this to any Christian music fan.  It will be especially powerful for anyone who has spent years in Mass listening to these moving and powerful songs 
 What a teffific book. Each chapter is written by different authors expressing their opinions on hunting practices, ethics, and why we hunt. Very thought provoking and insightful.From high-tech equipment to  baiting,this book gives the reader many different viewpoints of hunting to  look at and ponder.I have read many chapters numerous times and given  copies of this book to several friends.

 Love her recipes, gorgeous pics and wonderful new book! I think my favorite part of this is the presentation.  On page 192 the ULTIMATE GINGER COOKIE is one of my favorite recipes!!! 
 Upon reading this book I become more aware about what I can do to increase my wealth and health as well as help others do the same. Some of the knowledge obtained from this book is disturbing but necessary if we as a race are to evolve and care for each other in a holistic way.  Many thought provoking ideas should send your mind on a journey you will not regret. Knowledge truly is power. 
 A salient work in colonial US history, even though some of the argument is now dated (though I would not say disproved. 
 This book is about a shy hermit crab named Hector.  One morning, Hector wakes up to find that a flower has grown on his shell.  He tries everything to get the flower off, but nothing works.  Indeed, by the next morning, the flower grows even bigger.  Hector is mortified by his odd appearance, but the other crabs seem to find it quite attractive.  They gather round Hector, and soon Hector has a new group of friends.  The story is quite cute and not at all scary.  The book has about 200 words 
 What made me add a review here is the following: It is very ironic that Patrick Smith is being excused of peddling stereotypes in his book, given that his main intention is to counter the prevalent stereotypes that people are so fond of. Regardless of what you know about Japan, this book will make you think about it - provided you are willing to do that.   You might also get the impression from some of the other reviews that Smith's book is some sort of academic study or something like that. I haven't found a single occasion in the book where he claims anything like that - and at the end of the book, he says the exact opposite.  So one might ask whether those reviewers who trash the book here aren't showing exactly the kind of behaviour that Patrick Smith discusses in some detail: People, according to Smith, are way too attached to an unrealistic image of Japan, and they don't want to let go of it.  If you want to find out why that might be the case read the book. Smith discusses a fairly large variety of examples, many of which you will not find elsewhere that easily. And even where one is inclined to disagree with him - for example when Smith dismisses most contemporary Japanese literature as fluff - his writing and ideas are still interesting enough to make you think about it.

 The book "Dining by Rail" was purchased at the urging of a ten-year old son who is a rabid railfan. The book not only has a treasure trove of the most famous recipes from all the different rail lines, but it features a marvelous history of railroads from the point of view of the customer, the cooks, and others whose job it was to provide customer service. One also learns how the menus on the trains reflected the relations with the most important commercial customers of the railroad, an aspect nostalgic railfans don't always think about.  The book is well written and carefully researched. The pictures are evocative, and the recipes very easy to follow and recreate.  Altogether, this book is providing my son and me with a interesting and tasty railroad education 
 Great deal on a set of knives that you'll have for a LONG time. Handles might seem a bit wonky, but actually seem to work better than the more attractive, traditional versions on other knives 
 At first I could not believe that the 3 hour time limit was true because the smaller batteries didn't even last 45 minutes using the eye viewer. To my surprise, this battery lasted over the 3 hour limit and I used the TV viewer to film. I do sports videography and I need something that  wouldn't have to run and charge every hour becaue in tournament action every game is back to back.  This was beyond what I wanted and I ordered two when i really only needed one! I must say that this is a new battery and I am not sure how long it takes for the charge to start to degenerate, etc. this was a good buy at a good price 
 '60 Minute Gourmet' and `More 60 Minute Gourmet' are collections of New York Times columns written by the prominent French born and trained chef Pierre Franey, who attained celebrity by being the executive chef at La Pavilion, considered by Craig Claiborne at the beginning of his New York Times career as the only truly worthy `haute cuisine' venue in New York City.  On the surface, it may seem that these volumes are simply precursors to Mark Bittman's `The Minimalist' columns in the same New York Times or to Rachael Ray's very successful 30 Minute Meal genre. While there are strong family resemblences between these three writers, there are also significant differences. Most of these differences arise from the fact that While Bittman and Ray are journalist / educator / writers, Franey was a classically trained chef.  This distinction is crystal clear in the way Franey describes his audience and how they live their lives. With the greatest of respect, I sense that Franey sees his audience as just stepping out of a `New Yorker' cartoon of upper West side coop dwellers who shop at Zabars and who may expect the likes of R. W. Appel or Ruth Reichl to drop in for a quick bite on any given Thursday evening. One may be tempted to say `this is not me', but give yourself a chance to believe that you can put yourself into this picture. Franey is saying that you can be prepared to entertain elegantly with even a minimal amount of time.  Franey is crystal clear from the introduction of the first of these two books that he is not simplifying gourmet dishes, he is picking and choosing those classic French dishes which can be made in the home within 60 minutes. His message is that contrary to expectations, a lot of French cooking, even `haute cuisine' can be made very simply. And, I have no argument with this. After browsing Escoffier's big book of recipes, I find about 50 different recipes for sauting chicken, every one of which can easily be done in 30 minutes or less.  The most valuable lessons in these books are things that a professional chef does to expedite his own work. One of the hidden tricks behind Miss Rachael's speed is that she spends no time whatsoever looking for her ingredients. Franey reveals the technique that makes this all possible. He exhorts us to always have a place for everything and keep everything in its place. The easiest way to experience the value of this lesson is to try cooking in someone else's kitchen. His second big lesson is cleanliness, as much for efficiency as for hygiene. He says clutter and debris distract from efficiency.  It is important to note that these two volumes have virtually identical tables of contents, so the `More 60-Minute Meals' is literally more of the same. It's only additional topics are on appetizers and desserts. And, unlike his La Pavilion colleague, Jacques Pepin, I suspect Pierre is not as skillful with the pastry as is Jacques. Like Rachael Ray, a very large number of the recipes in these books are for grilled, sauted, or fried chicken, with an enormous variety of sauces. In fact, Miss Rachael just did a version of chicken Veronique that was remarkably similar to the recipe on page 22 of `60-Minute Gourmet'. I honestly prefer Franey's version, as it uses white grapes while Rachael used red, and, Franey's instructions are written in plain English while Rachael uses her Rayspeak culinary dialect for a lot of basic terms. I would suspect that Miss Rachael had cribbed this recipe from Franey except that she made a major point of stating that the recipe was acquired from her future mother-in-law.  What Rachael lacks in sophisticated technique, plain speech, and deep knowledge of French cuisine, she makes up by addressing the two of the three major issues I have with Franey. First, even 60 minutes may be a bit more than a tired Manhattenite may be able to manage, especially after a subway ride and a 5 block walk from the local supermarket. Second, Franey makes much of planning and prepping ahead of time. The fallacy of this and practically every other `quick cooking' advice is that the problem is not only that there is little time at the end of the day, there is little time throughout the week. A third potential objection to Franey's books is that if there is so many `haute cuisine' recipes which are really pretty easy, why not simply go to the mother lode and get a copy of Escoffier or Pellaprat for their 39 ways to poach eggs and 52 recipes for sauted chicken. The problem with this solution is that the search for the good recipes takes more time and investment in studying the techniques needed to prepare the short recipe description in these texts.   Like Wolfgang Puck in a very recent book, Franey cuts down on the time required to prepare a recipe by combining into a single narrative all the steps and techniques you need so you don't have to seek out and learn a lot of ancillary recipes. Also, the classic French texts don't have the entertaining headnotes you can recite to impress your dinner guest(s).  Thus, I really think Franey's books are best used as a resource for recipes for entertaining where the plan and prep ahead time will garner big rewards with your guests. I would therefore strongly recommend Franey's books for young professional ladies or gentlemen who are out to impress a potential partner over a home-cooked dinner. I would not use these books to replace my copy of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', as there are great realms of French cooking technique which simply lie outside Franey's 60 minutes, the most important being braising and roasting techniques.  These books are excellent introductions to how French cooking can be easy. Recommended. 
 As an enthusiast of modern day aerial warfare, complete with its thrust-vectoring, BVR engagement, pin-point bomb delivery, and missiles that actually work, I had some reservations about reading this book. Adding to my apprehension was the timeframe, set early in the Viet Nam War while valuable lessons were still unlearned, and the mere fact that it had anything to do with the Viet Nam War. Though I was born as Saigon fell in '75, I feel such intense and conflicting emotions when reading about it.  Anyways, let me just say that General Cook quickly laid to rest all of my apprehension. From page 1 onward I was hooked. "Once a Fighter Pilot" is a chronicle of Cook's Air Force career from enlistment, through training, and finally his deployment to, survival of, and return home from SE Asia.  His recollections of his combat experiences are very vivid and involving, especially for the amount of time between the experiences and the writing of this book.  Most impressive was Cook's "anti-Maverick" attitude and admission of feeling real human emotions such as fear and sorrow, a rare quality among fighter-jock autobiographies. Most sobering were the General's accounts of losing close friends to accidents and to the enemy.  Cook allows those of us who were born after the war to feel the pain and frustration of the generation that lived through it, feelings that bring with them an understanding of why that pain and frustration continue to be felt today.   I had to refrain from giving this book a 10 simply because I wanted more. Though Cook acknowledges that many memories have been forgotten or are so blurred to render them untransferable to the written word, I still felt like this man had many more stories of bravery, heroism, high-spirited wit, and sorrow to tell. I highly recommend this book not only to enthusiasts of military aviation, but to critics of those who put their lives on the line in Viet Nam, as well as anyone with an appreciation for good stories about the ups and downs of li! fe, especially stories that are as well-written and easy to follow as Cook's "Once a Fighter Pilot.&quot

 This is a comprehensive and user-friendly guide by an experienced architect whose commitment to healthy and sustainable building is complete. There is no fluff to be found here - from foundation to finish, Paula Baker  tells us how to select materials which work for both us and the  environment 
 As a resident of Mexico City, who has studied its history, La Capital by Jonathan Kandell is the finest example of what a history  book can be. It reads like a page-turner mystery and the publisher should hang their head in shame that the book has not been reprinted. I'll run out today and buy whatever copies are left in Mexico, to give as gifts in the future 
 Kon-Tiki is the story of some Scandinavians who sail across the Pacific in an Incan raft made of balsa, in order to lend credence to a cultural-diffussionist theory hypothesized by the author and leader of the "adventure," Thor Heyerdahl. (The theory is that Polynesia was colonized from the east, South America. The voyage across the Pacific was to prove that it was possible for ancient Peruvians to cross the ocean. However, the voyage does not prove Heyerdahl's theory.) The book goes into great detail describing the encounters of the crew onboard out on the open ocean including an encounter with a whale shark, a rare Gempylus, circling dolphins, flying fish so abundant that they fly onto the raft's deck whereupon they can be gathered for food, whales, and sharks. The men lived off the sea by fishing and trapping rain water, braving the elements in a 40-foot long raft for 101 days before finally shipwrecking upon a reef surrounding a small island.  The book is well written and an enjoyable, absorbing read 
 Ok, I have read all of the reviews so I will keep this short. I have been a Samael fan since 1992. Yes, this album is VERY different from Blood Ritual, and Ceremony of Opposites, but if you call yourself a true Samael fan BUY THIS ALBUM. Everyone goes through changes. Think of how much your music taste has changed in 10 years. This is an unreal album like all of the rest 
 Very good history of Earth First! before they got taken over by politically correct left coast weenies. Earth First! was very cool back in the day. They were very radical redneck hippies that drank beer, got laid, ate meat, smoked dope, in general they weren't opposed to hunting, were very politically incorrect and they got things done without compromise when mainstream conservation groups couldn't or wouldn't. Lots of interesting stuff on Dave Foreman and other well known Earth Firsters as well as other environmental groups and activists, plus info on the Judi Barr bombing as well as the FBI's methods of infiltration when they targetted Dave Foreman in their failed attempt to put him away. 
 It really helps the young inquiring mind learn about the moon.  My almost 5 year old always wants this read.  Also it tells you how to do a demonstration to show younger kids why the moon looks the way it does, why it changes.  I'm glad we got this book 
 Feist's record "Let it Die" is a secret little gem sprinkled with great songs.  You can sink into this whole album, especiall "gatekeeper" and "let it die" very easily.  The smooth sound of this album is intoxicating and her voice so delicate.   She reminds me of Gretchen Lieberum, whose new release "Siren Songs" is comparable to "Let it Die."  Both have such a mellow sound and inescapably seductive appeal 
 I have to say Liz Curtis Higgs sheds new light, at least for me, on a lot of those women in the Bible. You know, I've read about all these women in Ms. Curtis's book before, but somehow when I read my bible I missed a whole heck of a lot. I don't know how, because when I read this book I wanted to slap myself upside the head plenty of times. Duh, I'd mudder, how come I didn't see that? How come I didn't get it? Well I'm getting a lot of it now. As a Bible teacher, Ms. Curtis really excells and she makes it oh so interesting. I highly recommend this book 
 I purchased this book after viewing David Lachapelle's website, and while it is certainly a decent collection of photographs, the photos lack some of the style that Lachapelle's more recent work has. If you are a fan of the work found on his website, then I would suggest Hotel Lachapelle instead of this book 
 Accelerated C# 2005 covers the C# language extensively, and does not only teach you the syntax but also explains what happens under the hood, has great code examples, and gives recommendations on how to do, and NOT do to things in the language.  The first four chapters cover the basics and the remaining nine delve into more advanced topics, including the newest enhancements to C# 2005 like Generics, Anonymous methods and Iterators.  The book is written in a conversational style and is very easy to read. The author explains some of the pitfalls of concepts inappropriately and gives concrete examples of how to do things correctly.   The author also goes into great detail as to what happens under the hood in the CLR when C# code is written and shows the reader how certain things are inefficient or unwise to do as a result. A reader would gain a great understanding of what happens underneath the surface when they are writing C# code by reading this book.   Overall, this book is probably best suited for a C++ programmer moving to C#, since so much reference to C++ is made and it becomes immediately clear to an experienced C++ developer where the differences in C# lie. However, anyone who wants to learn C# in depth would benefit from this book. A great read! 
 This book provided my team with enough confidence and flexibility to design a research project of the right scale and formality for our needs, but gave us enough structure to stay on track. Kuniavsky's detailed examples and caveats helped us engage with users  respectfully and effectively, leaving both parties feeling they had done something to move the site a step forward. 
 I practice some of the rituals in this book and beleive it or not some of the things I wanted came about, but Lord did I pay for it.  This is a book that is powerful but I tell anyone just stick Christ because spell casting is not worth it 
 This CD contains the beautiful music from this classic movie. All music without singing or talking is included, so, sadly, you won't find songs like "For the Beauty of the Earth," or "Here We Come a Wasseling." Every great movie has an overture, and this soundtrack includes that. It brings back memories 
 This book provides a thorough yet easy to understand overview of vehicle dynamics and how they affect performance.  The mathematical basis for all concepts are provided, as are graphs , illustrations, sample problems, and solutions.  I highly recommend this text for anyone interested in vehicle dynamic 
 If you need info on Hacker Martin, the famous gunmaker, this is the book 
 This is an excellent product for business travellers. It really prevents others to watch you. The view/clarity is excellent. I should have purchased this product sooner 
 When our baby was born I was of the mind set that I didn't want to rely on everyone else for child raising ideas. This put me in a difficult position because I've never been around babies before. So, I put away my pride but kept searching for ideas on my own too. That's how I found this book. Lansky has included a lot of great ideas for helping you interact with your baby in creative ways. I agree that it is not perfect (and am not sure that any book really is), but this can be easily overlooked due to the other very redeeming qualities 
 I've searched all over for a doubler that was less than 32" and this works great!  I have short closet bars so most doublers caused my lower bar clothes to drag on the floor.  This product lets me pick the length I need.  It's metal materials makes it quite durable too.  Hooray 
 John McDowell's insight on how we acquire conceptual knowledge of the external world is brilliant. Basing his argument on the Kantian conception of receptitivity and spontaneity, John McDowell not only eases the philosophical anxiety of acquiring conceptual capacities and the epistemic role experience plays by destroying the need for the anxiety at all. I recommend this for any person interested in philosophy that is constructive and not just a response to someone else's question. McDowell, unlike most philosophers in our age, is not just picking at a niggling point, he is bringing fresh ideas to the philosophical table. 
 I truly could not stop reading this.  That hasn't happened to me in a long time.  The plot gripped me early on, and it didn't let up.  There are twists and turns galore, and just when you start breathing a sigh of relief thinking everything is okay . . . it's not.  The author is also able to stir up some emotion.  There are some scenes, which I will not give away, that just sort of hit you right over the head.  I recommend this to anyone who loves suspense and is looking for something different 
 This book is beautiful outside, I love the lace up binding and place for picture on the front. What I do not like is how there is no specific places to write in, you just have to use your imagination as to how to word and to position things on each page..too much like scrapbooking for me, I wanted a book with blank lines and spots to write in..For example one blank page will say, "All About Mom" then another that says "Baby Shower" etc..but the pages are blank. I need more structure 
 ...of just how brilliant Mr. Zevon was at songwriting. The performances vary, but the songs are uniformly excellent 
 This is the story of an Indian merchant's triumphs and failures, both business and personal, in a river port town in an unnamed African country.  It is also the story of the town itself, and of Africa's struggle with itself and with outsiders.  I listened to the unabridged audio, and look forward to reading the actual book some day when I'm not on the road so much 
 This book is pretty good if I do say so myself. I have been looking for a book about supernatural beings and paranormal entities for a while now, so I had to get this book when I so it. I'm glad to say that it didn't dissapoint me. Everything from ghosts, bigfoot, werewolf and sea-type creatures to the creatures of fairy, demons and alien type figures. And this book didn't overly sensationalize things either. For instance, the section on vampires makes it fairly clear that MOST vampire cases are simply people who thrive off of warm blood.... not necessarily the sexy, super-powerful undead beings shown in hollywood. It also talks about the reality of demons and how they do indeed manifest themselves and sometimes harass people in physical ways but that there are many "human" monsters who are simply possessed by these ill beings. All in all, this book is excellent for those who take any sort of interest in the world beyond 
 Bernard Butler and Brett Anderson were great together - by themselves they lost the dynamic that made Dog Man Star what it is - a work that rivals the breadth of Diamong Dogs by Bowie. It was a defining album of the 90s.  So I expected big things from this album - made without the pressure of having to follow-up such a defining precedent.  I wasnt impressed with the singles: I thought the song 'Lovers' is actually a bit Post-butler-Suede with a chord progression we've heard too many times. Autograph is a great song - and I can actually hear Bernards trebbly chords and unique scale fiddling behind the Johnny Marr riff in the second verse. But their choice as singles is a real pity, because some of the other tracks on the album are classics!  The tracks Beautiful Pain and Apollo 13 are progressive in terms of the lyrics, Brett's brave and honest vocals and the whole melodies. Whereas some of the other tracks haunt back to lyrics and concepts that Brett has already covered on earlier, better works. It isnt Suede - its something new and quite impressive - im looking forward to the next album and hopefully better single choices ; 
 Laugh out loud funny, well, the first section mainly. Then it gravitates to deeper issues. This book is about a spiritual quest. But it's readable and welcoming! I'm usually not into reading spiritual books. I could never get even through the first page of most.   But not this one. Ms. Gilbert writes from her heart and is willing to share every bit of herself, which I'm not exactly sure why she would, and I don't think she is quite sure either but she committed to writing the piece, no matter what. I respect and appreciate that on many levels. 
 was forwarned about this one..but wanted to experience it myself. the directors camera style was very hard to take but overall added to the feeling of control being taken from you. great performances by all the actors. the reverse storytelling was used to great advantage. subtitles not to hard to follow..overall a shocking unexpected experience i would give 5 outa 5 to.  
 This is one of the portfolio of books exploring what it takes to create successful democratic nation-building--From German to Iraq (as the subtitle notes).  It is also one of the better volumes among such works.  The RAND report goes into considerable detail,  providing an operational definition of democratic nation building by looking at the commonalities in seven such interventions (Germany, Japan, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan).  The report seeks to establish those factors associated with success or failure.  Among those linked to success were the use of force "to underpin a process of democratization" (Page 1), occupation, peace enforcement, stabilization, and reconstruction.  Success is (Page 2) ". . .the ability to promote an enduring transfer of democratic institutions."    The RAND report suggests a number of prerequisites, including military presence over time by the occupying country, international police presence over time, reducing postconflict combat-related deaths, timing of elections, dealing with refugees and internally displaced persons, initial external assistance, external per capita assistance, external assistance as a meaningful percentage of GDP, and changes in per capita GDP.   This obviously entails a commitment to provide substantial resources to the redevelopment effort, to be willing to invest considerable time to nation building, to make sure that appropriate security arrangements are made.  In short, the process cannot successfully be done quickly or "on the cheap."    Unhappily, the conclusions of this book--if accurate--surely raise questions about the ultimate success of the American involvement in Iraq 
 I worked with Linda closely for a year when she had small children in the Mid-1980's. I was very touched and disturbed by this book. I found it to the point, but forgiving. I commend Linda for her resiliency and candor.  I  know that to write this book she had to rediscover many guarded memories. I  encourage all to read it. Anne Sexton was a complicated, brilliant artist.  Her life was fascinating to read about, especially from her daughter's  intimate perpective. The poems that were included helped me to more fully  understand the artist and woman through the different stages of her life. I  hope Linda writes again 
 Lover Boy/Juanito el Carinoso: A Bilingual Counting Book by Lee Merrill Byrd features charming illustrations by Francisco Delgado and provides young children ages 6 and up with a fun and creative approach to counting in both Spanish and English. Lover Boy/Juanito el Carinoso is picturebook tale of one young boy named Johnny who was very affectionate and expressed it through giving kisses, earning him the nickname of "Lover Boy". Following Lover Boy through his journey of counting and kissing, Lover Boy/Juanito el Carinoso will thoroughly entertain children while they learn to count in two languages. A welcome addition to family, school, and community library bilingual book collections for children, Lover Boy/Juanito el Carinoso is very highly recommended as a fun and entertaining guide to counting in English and Spanish 
 Found the book was well laid out and covered all the relevant topics very well.  Book was also very readable for a text book on corporate finance.  However, the I did not think the CD or the supplements were worth much, but I don't know how much they added to the cost 
 There are some great courtroom scenes in this movie that are so powerful and the acting is fantastic. The story of honor and pride in one's country and way of life is an inspiration for anyone who is a believer in truth, justice and the American Way 
 I love to cook! I always thought that fish prepared simply was best. This Loomis book really turned around my experience. She takes you on tour through areas where fish is caught and cooked. We get the recipes of  fisherman (they know how to do this right) and also some incredible sauce  recipes. I love Sauce Piquant with Redfish. Try it and see if you don't  agree.  I turn to this book so often for advice and recipes. It's a must  have if you want to do Seafood right 
 The author should take a bow. He has written a wonderfully balanced, anecdotal-rich account of the simultaneous evolution of the Cold War, TV and political culture in the Age of McCarthy (which is, in all too many ways, an age we are still in.) That the junior senator from the cheeshead state was a craven opportunist is as well known now as it was even then, but what he exploited via the new electronic medium was the pervasive fear that subversion lurked behind every vacuum tube as well as behind every State Department desk. 
 Reading this book is like eating peanuts.  Once you start you can't stop.  This is about the best of Niven's know space books.  Known space of our solar system is settled and quite productive.  The PAC is an interesting and very alien creature.  Indeed, of most aliens, this is one of the most dangerous to normal humans.  Larry did an outstanding job making one of the best novels I've ever read.  True Niven fans will not be let down.  Note, this book is a must read for Ringworld, Ringworld Engineers, and Ringworld's Children coming in Summer of 2004.  Enjoy!! 
 Fantastic, take all the videos and pictures you want with the best quality 
 As a novice in the realm of WDW visitors, I have been planning a trip to visit WDW for Halloween.  I found this book to be a terrific guide.  This edition of the book is spiral bound and has fold-out maps of each of the 4 parks and a review of each ride.  Also invaluable are the guides to the restaurants (sit-down as well as counter service) as well as tips to help you get through the trip without killing your traveling companion out of frustration.  The book is well written and lovingly researched by Disney vacationers.  The spiral binding makes it easier to open and the packing list is invaluable.  Anyone who wants to visit the Kingdom of the Mouse, this book will be quite helpful in getting the most enjoyment out of your travel budget 
 An amazing girl I know recently played me the live version of "Spring Wind" and it, well... it blew me away. I had to hear more of this incredible artist. I enjoy listening to many other singer/songwriters: Bruce Cockburn, John Hiatt, Leonard Cohen, et al, but had never even heard of Greg Brown. His lyrics are soulfull and entertaining and his voice is deep and warm. I am also quite the audiophile and I'm *very* impressed with the recordings on this disc. Greg's voice is right there on center stage and the instrumentation and imaging are spot on; excellent job of remastering on this one. I highly recommend this CD to fans of the previous artists I mentioned and specifically to audiophiles who just like to sit and listen to beautifully recorded music. I haven't watched the DVD yet, but it's a great bonus to an already great CD 
 This 2 Disc set includes Simon's greatest hits with the duo Simon & Garfunkel plus highlights from his solo work. Disc One includes the old classics from the 1960s like Sound Of Silence, El Condor Pasa and Cecilia, plus his 70s solo hits like the reggae ditties Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard and Mother And Child Reunion and other hits like the impressive American Tune and the fun hit 50 Ways To Leave Your Lover. Disc Two draws from his masterpiece Graceland and the post-Graceland albums. Here my favourites include Boy In The Bubble, Under African Skies and You Can Call Me Al but others like Further To Fly are also beautiful. The anthology is a great compilation of his best known and commercially most successful songs 
 If you're fed up with fumbling even a collegiate-sized or paperback book on your lap just to quickly look up a definition, synonym or spelling, you'll love this electronic dictionary/thesaurus, which conveniently presents all that right on the computer screen where you're already working.  But unfortunately, you'll have to minimize your current program to get to the desktop icon for this program, since it offers no way to pop it up from an icon in the tray -- its worst shortcoming, in my view.  The only way to have it immediately available is by running it, then minimizing it to the taskbar, where it consumes space along with other programs you may already have minimized there. I suppose that's really a minor quibble, but it bugs me greatly because there's no reason beyond lazy programming that it couldn't have offered a tray icon option.  The two exceptions to that are if you're writing in MS Word or Corel's WordPerfect, where macros can be installed as buttons, allowing you to highlight a word and pop it up in the dictionary/thesaurus by clicking that button.  But that's a sadly limited use of a major program's pop-up capability, which with a little extra programming could have been expanded to include virtually any selected word on the screen, as is possible with some other electronic dictionaries.  That notwithstanding, the program offers the same robust selection of definitions and synonyms you'll find in the printed Merriam-Webster Collegiate, but with a number of easily clickable search options for finding them. They're also presented in basically the same excellent format Merriam-Webster uses in its printed versions.  If you can't find a suitable word in the 225,000 definitions and 340,000 synonyms and related words available in this program, you're probably looking for something that'll drive whoever's reading what you're writing to a dictionary.  Selecting the dictionary or thesaurus is as quick and easy as clicking on either from a drop-down menu prominently at the top of the program -- and you can set either as the default on startup.  Other configuration preferences are sparsely limited to changing text size/color and background color, and setting a default for any of the 19 search "types."  To look up a word, you can select from three tabbed options:  Basic Searches (Entry word is...): You'd likely use this most. As soon as you enter the first letter a list pops up in a lower window with everything beginning with that letter. As you type additional letters, you increasingly drill down to words nearer what you're looking for, ending with your word highlighted when you type the final letter. This is basically exactly the same routine as when you use the "Find" feature of any Windows help program -- and sure beats flipping through pages of a book.  Advanced Searches: This is a Boolean thing using AND, OR, NOT and some possible parenthetical expressions. I found it to be mostly an advanced piece of uselessness.  Browse: This is basically like thumbing through a printed dictionary starting at some letter and functions exactly the same as drilling down through the letters of a word using the Basic search feature. But -- and that's a big BUT -- its two options of searching for either the beginning or ending of a word can be a lifesaver when you have no idea how to begin spelling that word. For example: Try looking up "ptarmigan" under "T" or "mnemonic" under "N." You'll get nowhere fast on either. But search for the fairly obvious endings and sooner than later you'll find those words.   One other quibble I have with this program is that it refuses to recognize my USB mouse wheel for scrolling through the word lists. But I've learned to be content with the side slider.  Its few shortcomings aside, at Amazon's price this program's a world-class bargain, functions flawlessly for what it's intended and hands down beats wrestling with a book 
 Cheryl Reed set out on a seemingly impossible mission: to cut through the stereotypes, pull back the layers of mystery, and illuminate the truth about some of the most misunderstood women in the world. If that were not challenge enough, she then gave herself the unenviable task of telling their stories in an honest, intelligent and sensitive manner. Amazingly, she managed to succeed on all counts. "Unveiled: The Hidden Lives of Nuns" is simply a terrific book. Anyone whose life has been influenced by nuns - those who have been their students, those who have been the recipients of their charity, and surely those who have been both - will find this book to be a pleasant surprise. Given the usual portrayals of nuns in the popular press as either cardboard-cutout saints or caricatures of classroom disciplinarians, we would have expected "Unveiled" to be more of the same. Instead, Cheryl Reed's thoughtful (not to mention prayerful) journey yielded stories that help us understand the diversity and passion of women who choose to live a life outside the mainstream in order to serve those struggling to navigate the mainstream's currents. That these stories were discovered and told so well by a non-Catholic is remarkable. Then again, maybe only a non-Catholic - at least one committed to rejecting the myths and starting on the search with an open mind - could provide such a fresh and objective perspective. We heartily recommend "Unveiled" to anyone who sincerely desires to put away their preconceived notions and truly come to know the complicated and inspirational lives of nuns.  
 The Sky atlas companion goes along perfectly with the Sky Atlas itself. Everyone of those obscure deep sky objects, like those open clusters not in the NGC, have little entries. If you have the Sky Atlas 2000 already, this book is a great supplement 
 The game pieces are very good quality. I found the cards to be challenging. The game was well worth the money. 
 This anthology answers the question, who were the female poets of the Harlem Renaissance era?  Also, What were they writing?  This book printed duirng the 90's successfully answers and is still the definitive book on the subject of female poets of the Harlem Renaissance era. From Angelina Weld Grimke, Helene Johnson to Georgia Douglas Johnson's famous poem, Heart of a Woman, to some of the poets who are not well known, such as Mary Jenness and Ruth Dixon, this book explores the themes of the notable and less notable in poetry. This book is divided into three sections, Protest, Heritage and Love & Passion.  This book gives a wonderful taste of poetry with little or no commentary.  This is a must read and must have for anyone who has ever contemplated the question, who were the female writers of the period and what did they write?  This will answer sufficiently that question or will tease the tongue for more about these poetesses of the era 
 I have been using Marty Rossman's audios, initially for self-help, but eventually to help my clients as well, for over a decade. Just as I did, clients often need considerable repetition before they can internalize his intonation and phrasing. Anything new from Marty is a must-have for me. Do yourself a favor--learn to talk to yourself the way he "talks" to you on this CD. Your life will change 
 This collection of photos from Playboy's golden years is well worth the price of admission. All of the photos are from the mid-fifties to the early seventies, a time when "girl-next-door" really meant something 
 I'm not a great conversationalist, but I found that the table topics stimulated sharing of opinions and ideas between myself and my friends. We've had a lot of fun and know each other better 
 The only complaint is that this book isn't longer.  This is how it all begins for Bertie and Jeeves, and several of the incidents related become references in the later stories.  Having read this collection after reading some later works, it was interesting to see how it all started.  Brilliant, and as a previous reviewer noted, the only question is what edition of this book to buy.  For the money, this one was perfect for me 
 Forget all those Miles Davis books written by family outsiders. I've read them all because I'm a BIG MILES FAN.   This one is by his oldest son. I loved the easy story-telling style of the book and I was amazed that Miles would expose his son to drugs, danger, and some of the mean and nasty things he did to women.  Despite all that Gregory went through with his dad, I was moved to hear how he still loves his father.  Wow!  This is a powerful read -- especially the parts where we see how the family cheated him in the will. You gotta read this book if you want to know the REAL Miles 
 This book is a parody, a satire written by a very knowlegebale author. It is about a young Jewish immigrant,Vladamir, who has lived in the USA for 15 years and at the opening of the novel is 25 years old.He is having trouble adapting to life in America. He is a paasive non initiated person in the American way of life.He hold a bureaucratic job. He paints a parody of the USA and is a satire with much humor about the nineties.  To be successful he decides he needs power, money, sex appeal and an American woman. To get these things he undertakes marginal even criminal activites. His adventures are humerous. He fails. A link to the Russian Mafia causes him to escape to a fictitious Eastern Block Country and to the City of Prava (probably Prague). There again his aggressive not though  activities put him in danger with the local mafia and eventually he returns to America. In Europe He is still after the same inner needs for success that he longs for in the USA. Over 5 years he somewhat matures and integrates more his American and Russian identities though he still feels a person living in two worlds.(The life of many first generation immigrants). His adventures are erotic aggressive, funny rediculous and sometimes criminal. The author has a very thorough knowledge of Russian culture and literature which he refers to in the text, often in a very funny way. The prose is long and drawn out and not always easy to follow.The book is very clever.If you want a look at the modern world through the eyes of a Jeweis Russian immigrant the book is worthwhile 
 Well written, very informative, and very easy to get an up close and real personal feeling for the men and women warriors of WWII and the sacrifices they made to guarantee freedom 
 Finally, with Blue Note Jackie mclean and Co. were given the time and opportunity to practice/rehearse/jam before the tape started rolling. Not to disparage records like Mcleans Scene, Strange Blues, Alto-Madness etc... for they are wonderful but all are extremely loose and seem to tetter at times not emotionally but in a what the hell is coming next kind of way which is beautiful...its just on New Soil a little preconceiving seems to have let things grow unhindered. Donald Byrd on trumpet, Paul Chambers bass, Walter Davis Jr. piano, and Pete La Roca on drums...an oak-solid band who swing in and out of Mcleans furrowed like phrases...relentlessly. I highly recommend this music 
 This is my first, but won't be my last, experience with Coach in a Box. Dr. G. is in his usual form (obviously speaking to a live audience) but this material, in this form, is probably not for those uninitiated to TOC.  An outstanding supplement to William Dettmer's Systems book on TOC 
 I Have owned this CD for several years now, and every time I listen to it I am reminded how fabulous it is. Every song on this disc is amazing. My favorite song is UnDo Control, but I love woman vocals in metal 
 Sue Grafton does a great job keeping this series fresh and interesting. Four books in and I still can't wait to read more! And she gets better with each book. In this book (and to a smaller degree in 'C') there were many times where I couldn't fathom how Kinsey would keep on the trail and solve the case. But she always manages to plausibley get back on the trail without causing the reader to lose interest. Kinsey's development as a character is also very well done. She is a very real, likeable person with amazing depth 
 I was actually there during filming but didn't get to see any of it going on.It's my MOST LOVED movie EVER!!!  Of course being filmed on Mackinac island is a BIG part of it, I was mesmerrized. Last year I was walking by the Murray Hotel which shows it every night and I was just totally freaked.  Mind you I have seen this film a zillion times. But seeing it on Mackinac just put me over the edge... Mackinac is a TOTALLY GORGEOUS SPOT.   I MAKE MY HUSBAND TAKE ME THERE EVERY SUMMER EVEN THO WE LIVE IN FLORIDA. I have never gotten to stay at the Grand.  It is REALLY expensive.  Maybe I will someday...  HoHo...  It REALLY is THE MOST ROMANTIC film EVER made.  Even my teen age son wells up with tears...Don't pass this one by.   
 James Scott Bell's "Presumed Guilty" is yet another of this fine author's novels, brilliantly weaving together a story of suspense and inspiration... while at the same time providing his readers with insight (from his background as a trial lawyer), into our often-less-than-perfect legal system.  Authors Bell and Terri Blackstock have a unique ability to create spellbinding stories, while remaining true to their deeply-held Christian beliefs.  Hopefully they'll both continue writing to entertain, educate, and inspire us!   --Ron Howe (a.k.a. Toby Martin II) Erskine, Minnesota 
 Recommended by our Church group, belive it or not. Wonderful couples tool. Relaxing, caring and VERY loving 
 This is an excellent collection osf articles wich focuses on differents aspects of Stockhausen musical thinking. Make a good read of "Ponts and groups", "Composing statistically",  "Moment-forminng and MOMENTE" and "Microphonie". It was  specially fruitful for me, despite I have benn reading differents books  about Stockhausen before. It is also strongly recommended for those who  want to read about him for the first time. There are several of allusions  to his bests works, specially the one he composed in the 60's, like  Kontakte or Gruppen. It is not a strongly "ego" book like the  interview of Mya Tannenbaum, so you may enjoy it, and, certainly learn a  lot about him and about music too 
 Good southern Gospell musi 
 I am a big fan of jazz organ and vibes.  Milt Jackson is the Wizard of the Vibes but the Incredible Jimmy Smith is the Master of the Organ.  He is unbelievable.  I own about 18 of his albums so far and they are all awesome but I gotta tell man, this is one of the best.    I love the Beastie Boys album, "The In Sound From Way Out!" and that is why I bought "Root Down".  I know, that is backwards, but whatever, I now own the album and will cherish it forever.  All you jazz only fans need to buy that Beasties Boys album, you will not be sorry you did 
 A rare instance of a book on the topic of mind control that is neither sensational or paranoid. Scholarly, yet readable, this is a valuable book that everyone should read 
 I have listened to Pat Metheny for almost 3 decades.  I have found most of his earlier works a bit more interesting to listen to.  The songs are more melodic and he didn't use all that guitar synthesizer sound nearly as much.  Despite the recording and production of this CD...the songs (Cross The) Heartland, Airstream, and The Epic are among the best on this particuliar CD. Certainly, this will have to rate as one of Metheny's best!!! 
 I enjoyed this compilation of Silk Road music very much.  It delivers a nice, diverse sample of music from the region.  My favorite track of the CD is Shikasta, but I like the others as well 
 Explosive action, drama and espionage that will keep you at the edge of your seat! Margin of Errors is a brave, unmincing and inspired novel that cleverly shifts between Grozny and Banjul in a tale filled with many surprises 
 If you like "No More Shall We Part" then this is for you - its in that approximate mode of Cave+Bad Seeds music.  I like this album a lot - and it has grown and grown on me over the years.  Lyrics like "love came a-knockin', came a-knockin' at our door. But you, you and me dear, we don't live there anymore". Ouch.  Much better as he sings it too.  I was a little worried when I first played it - there's a terrible buzz from the first strum of the guitar on the first song!!  Great album though 
 This is the best book I have yet seen on Velazquez. Informative and lushly illustrated: its got the pictures AND the thousand words (and more). As a painter myself I use this book almost like a holy book; for guidance, inspiration and refreshment of the spirit 
 I admire an author who deviates from a standard formula and the interweaving of two cases really works in "Piece of My Heart." DI Stanley Chadwick faces a murder case in 1969 against the backdrop of a rock 'n roll concert. His teenage daughter has facts to hide and DI Chadwick walks a fine line. DCI Alan Banks is seeking a murderer in 2005 which eventually connects with the 1969 murder.   The plot has already been outlined, so I'll just say it's a delight to visit DCI Banks again. I'm never disappointed 
 Due does it again with Joplin's Ghost. Due has a remarkable ability to take you out of the norm and give you chills. A cleaver and very creative story 
  I fell into the trap like everyone after watching Oprah last October 1999.  I ordered the book, joined the online clubs and started the diet, after the book came.   It really didnt seem like a diet, meat, veggies and reward dessert....   my favorite was MS Smiths Apple Pie.  I had this every night for two weeks, then it became funny because after I wasnt deprived of it, I really didnt want it.   I really thought it was a small joke, eat meat, eggs, and cheese, lose weight.  But after I read the book it really made sense.  Food is food, not a medication we can use to make things better, and after being on this diet for around 4-5 days, I got rid of the carb blur.  I saw just that.    I was really addicted to sugar and bread.  It was like a roller coaster that would intice me to ride all day long.  I would wake up and not be hungry, but eat, because we are supposed to right?  Al night long our body has starved and its got to have fuel.  I, like most people in this country really believed that.  Didnt think for a minute that the cereal industry sort of got that one over on us. But once I started the food going in, the wrong food, it would keep me craving more all day.  I wasnt hungry and I would eat.    But once I stopped the carbs, I could see things clearly.  I wasnt hungry.  I didnt have to eat a Toaster Struddle or a bowl of cereal.  I did have the dark colors under my arms, and I worried about that.  But after I was on this diet for a couple of months, they went away, and so did a lot of weight.  I lost over 50 lbs in about 6 months.  It stayed off for around 1 1/2 years.  I had to have hip replacement surgery, and I got way off my carbless ways.  I, then, didnt think eating a Snickers was a big deal, and POW   I gained the weight back in about 9 months.  This book, if used the right way  (I know a lot of people that think just buying diet stuff or exercise gear, will work, you have to use it) But if you do follow this diet, it will work. and very fast, and your tummy will be the first thing that goes away.  I lost 50 lbs with no exercise, I couldnt exercise, due to my hip being so bad off.  I went from 200 lbs to 150.  I started the diet on October 17, 1999,  my birthday, and at Christmas that same year, only around two months later, my mean old mother-in-law even noticed all the weight I had dropped.  It was like I was a different person all together.  I smiled, I looked into mirrors when I walked by, I liked myself. I bought new clothes and loved the way i wore them.  A different life for me.  I know people say they are happy while being fat.  I was not.  I looked at the mirror and was fat.    When I started the carb diet, I learned that food is just that, its food.  Yes we all get together for dinners and other things revolving around food, but its the friendship, not the food.  My brother, and his wife, both bought the book after they saw me over Christmas and they followed the diet too.  They both lost weight.  A lot of weight even.  My best friend bought the book when she saw how fast I was losing weight, and she didnt read it, and didnt lose any weight at all.  But she would try to eat McDonalds sausage biscuits without the biscuit, and drink diet Mountian Dew.  it wasnt what the book asked for, and it didnt work.    I guess what my thoughts are, and what I truly feel, is here it is 2005, I am 200 lbs again, not happy with myself, no energy, no happiness in me, just existing. But I know what to do, and since I was there, at 150 and happy, I know when I get back there it isnt something to throw away.  So,I am now ordering this book again, to help me get back to what I felt before.  To help me feel less fat, and give me more energy.  The energy and the happiness is definately something the sugar and bread take from me.  I have no drive and no will power, and sneak to eat and cant do without my chocolate fixes once a month.  I know when I do this diet, and I follow it right, that all goes away and I can think of other things besides FOOD.  Because really, its only a Snickers bar.  Its not THAT important in the long life I can look forward to without CARBS.   Read the book and you will understand so much about why and how we eat and what you can do to make food work for you 
 I thought this book is wonderful.  If you want to personalize and change default setting in SharePoint this book will show you how to do it.  However, it does not cover the administration end of SharePoint 
 saw this when it came out, got it as a present for my friend the playwright who also saw it but who was delighted to own it & be able to see it again.  definitely worth it, touching, heartfelt 
 Each year I buy this calendar, and each year I am amazed by the beautiful photographs that incorporate such a sharp eye for detail. The text that accompanies each photograph is also full of information that places each teapot within it's historic context 
 I believe that Reba McEntire felt she was taking a chance on this but her performance was perfect.  I have been a fan of South Pacific since I saw the original as a child.  I like new interpretations of shows, opera, and such.  No one ever said a country singer couldn't play Nellie and those who don't like Brian Stokes Mitchell's operatic voice in it should be informed that Ezio Pinza was the original Emile de Becque and Georgio Tozzi,the voice in the movie.  Both were great stars of the Metropolitan Opera.  The person who did a great job as musical conductor, and I don't think he was mentioned above, was Paul Gemignani.  Also kudos to Walter Bobbie as Director - never less than perfect as a director or actor/singer.  I truly enjoyed it.  
 It's hard for me to express how this book disapointed me in concrete, rational terms. The best I can put it is: Gloria Kempton gives you an idea of what great dialogue should be, but doesn't teach you how to get there. What would have improved this book would have been examples of bad dialogue, dialogue that didn't serve its purpose, corrected into good dialogue. There is a snippet of that, but just a snippet.  This book is about 100 pages longer than it needed to be. Those last 100 pages or so draaaged. It's excessively repetative, to the point where I had to really force myself to get through even the last 10 pages. I couldn't imagine having to read even. one. more. word. of the repetative drivel.  I give Dialogue 4 stars because, despite the flaws-- and the typos, because there's a bunch of them-- the book departs valuable advice. You learn how easy dialogue can be if you just get inside your character's head and ask one question: what would this person say. You learn that dialogue is means to an end, not the end itself, and I think that's a mistake I've been making. There are exercises at the end of the chapter to help hone my skills. I liked the blocked out text on how to fix my work and the checklists-- both easy to reference when I need advice in a pinch, but don't have time to go through the many points I post-it-flagged in the book.  Not the earth-shattering manual I expected it to be, but with great qualities of its own. I'm sure it'll keep a place on my bookshelf 
  Two friends and I argued over the pains of writing while watching a magnificent sunset over the Pacific in Ocean Beach, San Diego.  "My writing is too short and to the point," Patrick said.  "I should strive for bigger pieces".  "Bigger and not to the point?" Eileen asked smirking.  I chuckled, then felt guilty.  "More like I want to pull in and engage the reader, be less concerned about brevity," Patrick answered.  "But every word SHOULD count," Eileen said.  This debate of "enriched" vs. "concise" writing seized me emotionally.  I pulled a yellow 3x5 card and jotted down quickly the essence of what was said.  "What are you doing?" Eileen asked.  "This dialogue is funny.  Its theme resonates with me a lot.  I'm capturing it as a fieldstone."  "Fieldstone?"  "I read this book by Gerald Weinberg," I replied, "in which he described convincingly how efficient it is to gather fieldstones throughout life (snippets of anything that carry energy for you) and later use them as needed in your writing."  "Though I do notice fieldstones, I never remember them later," Patrick complained, even as I was capturing that interaction--admittedly the first time ever I had prepared for such event.  "Weinberg addresses that with the 5-second rule." I proceeded to reveal a handful of Weinberg's secrets.  Both friends were now focused on me, not the sunset.  Their inquisitiveness fueled the energy I felt about the fieldstone.   At that time, I had no idea how I would use that dialogue until four days later I decided to write a review on Weinberg's book.  I decided to use that very fieldstone to capture the reader's attention regarding fieldstones.  Did it work?  I find Weinberg's method so convincing and practical that I'm surprised the publishers did not capitalize on the title acronym when designing the cover; nevertheless, invest in this book, and I bet it will W.O.W. you 
 I have been using this book for years, both for overcoming my own nursing problems, and as a doula, helping my clients overcome their nursing problems. It is easy to use for specific problem solving. Dr. Jack Newman is a thoughtful and helpful doctor, and his book really shows it 
 John Shaw explains many good techniques for closeup nature photography, which are applicable even in today's digital world. However, this is still a book from the film-era, so anything relatively recent or digital (e.g. magnification ratios for digital cropped sensors, advancements in AF technology, change in lens lineup, etc) is not covered. It is perhaps due for a quick revision to bring it up to date to today's cameras. Also, the photos in this book are good, but perhaps not as striking as the photos in his other book, Nature Photography Field Guide 
 This book is indeed a personal study of James Bond as depicted in the books and in the films. For a half century, the Bond franchise has been enormously successful. Certainly no other superhero enjoys his uninterrupted popularity.  Why is that?  To answer that question, the author considers that Bond appeared just when the British Empire was collapsing...and the English were feeling impotent in global affairs.  Along comes Bond - a Churchillian figure - who saves his country and the West from evil blackmailers and dangerous villians..  Bond restores the psyche of the English male.  Then again, Bond's attitudes were comforting to those trying to cope with new dangerous ideas: third world or womens' liberation.  Bond takes charge...of women, and persons from other lands - some exotic, some from enemy camps.  I liked the part when the author discusses his impressions of James Bond when he was 10, 20, and beyond; it is interesting to see the evolution of his opinions. As a boy he was thrilled to death by the movie "Live and Let Die."  Today, he notices the flaws and even silliness of the some of the scenes.    Bond is also popular because (unlike most of us) he can sample the opposite sex from around the world and make generalizations (to men) about their sexuality.  Then there is the "male-talk".  Amazing - the books have sold 100 million copies...true, they are pulp fiction but usually well written pulp fiction. Ian Fleming's novels are ideally suited for the movies because their quick pace and strange adventure are exactly what Americans want from action films. In my view, whenever a Bond film follows the book, it tends to be good. When the film strays, it is considerably weaker.  (Consider the critical success of the 2006 CASINO ROYALE or the old success of Sean Connnery's original Bond flicks)    Simon Winder's "personal reflections" are intelligent and witty.  Most assuredly, he helped me understand Bond, not just enjoy him.  Those unfamiliar with the Bond BOOKS should read one or two to get the flavor of Ian Fleming's writing. Then tackle this volume.  Recommended. 
 I am a prolific reader who especially enjoys books that deal with "post apocolyptic" story lines.  But "A Gift Upon The Shore" is that and so much more.  I read it over and over again.  I have a large library and re-read many of my favorites, but each time I see  this book I want to pick it up and read it again.  It is, to me, the  perfect book for a writer to read.  If you love books, and all that they  represent you will love "A Gift Upon The Shore".  I believe that  once you've read it you will never forget the story and the two women (no  make that three women) who are so much a part of the tale 
 One of the last great musicals Hollywood has given us. Topol shines brightly in this Norman Jewison directed marvel. Visually and musically stunning, A perfect film to make one laugh, cry, sing-along and think. Why don't we get many others like it today? One of my very favorite musicals. Favorite films for that matter. Casted to perfection 
 In 1972 the Democratic National Committee Headquarters was located in offices on the sixth floor of 2600 Virginia Avenue NW in Washington D.C.  The building itself was part of a complex of hotel and office space and named for its location on the bank of the Chesapeak and Ohio canal: Watergate.  On the night of 17 June 1972, five men were arrested for breaking into DNC offices, apparently to repair illegal wiretaps that had been installed on a previous occasion.  Republican leadership  disavowed any knowledge of the wiretap, ascribing it to excessive zeal on the part of marginal party members.  And that might have very well been that--except that several reporters employed by The Washington Post found the entire escapade unexpectedly bizarre.  Surely, they thought, there's a bit more to it than that.  There was indeed.  Thirty years later, "Watergate" has become a byword for all manner of political corruption, and post reports Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward led the move to unravel the complex web of deceit that surrounded the break-in.  Although there have been several alternative ideas and although some have accused Bernstein and Woodward of not being quite as thorough as they might have been, their work for the Washington Post and their subsequent book ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN remains the standard outline of both the investigation and its result: slush funds, pay offs, hush money, political espionage, consiracy to commit perjury, and at the center of it all President Richard M. Nixon, who pulled the threads of the web.  This is the story of how those threads were traced back to Nixon.  It is not "literature;" Bernstein and Woodward are journalists and they tell their story in the straight-forward manner of the good reporters that they are.  Even so, it is a complicated story in which name is piled on name, event upon event; some readers, particularly those who are too young to recall the scandal itself, may feel that need to keep a score card.  Whatever the case, the story has breathless drive and dash, and it will lead to ask: "This is America?"  Apparently and sadly so.  Recommended.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
 Written by The Duke himself, this book provides insight into the life and music of the greatest composer jazz has ever produced.  If you ever wondered what Duke thought of those he played with and those he didn't; here it is in black and white.  Required reading for anyone interested in the history of American music 
 Ignore the negative reviews about this book. Dr. Gary Chapman has done a great job at helping single people find their love language in this book. I used it for small group bible study class & for devotional reading. It helped me connect with my christian & non christian friends, co-workers, family members, etc. in much a better way 
 This is a sad story of the Buloh family, new arrivals to Australia. It is told by Sonja, whose mother leaves her when she is three years old to be raised by her father, a drunken and abusive man. This book tells of life in Australia from the 1950's from the perspective of a new immigrant, and how high hopes can be dashed with unfortunate realities. 
 The book, The American Automobile Industry, includes sections on the origins of the automobile, the American Contribution to mass production and industrial organization, the rise of compact/small cars, as well as other topics. The book focuses mainly on history and goes into detail about how the major American automobile manufacturers came to be. It shows the rise of both GM and Ford Motor Company. The book shows in great detail how the modern automobile came to be in the United States. I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in learning about the history of the automobile industry in the United States. I conducted a series of readability tests and the results were as follows:Passive sentences: 0% Flesch Reading Ease: 37.5 Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 12. I reccomend at least a 10th grade reading level 
 This is an absolutely great book. So many techniques and projects to do. The photos and instructions for everything is done up very well and easy to understand. It is definitely worth the price 
 This book is truly an offering to all of us in the yoga community.  It is clear and reveals the concept of Krama or steps for many postures.  The book is a fantastic resource for students and teachers and it is certainly an addition to the literature. 
 	I chose to read the book Whirligig by Paul Fleischman because I thought that the cover of the book was interesting.  I read the back of the book and thought that it was an outstanding concept for a book.  This was a plot that could happen to anyone that is my age.  I like to read books that have things that can actually happen to me in them.  	This is a compelling story about a young boy named Brent who makes a terrible mistake.  He loses control of himself at a party he was at and left in a fit of rage.  This would be the worst decision that Brent would make.  He wanted to die and closed his eyes while behind the wheel.  He was unsuccessful in his suicide attempt, but it in the process, struck and killed a young girl named Lea.  	Brent was crushed by this tragic event and wanted to do everything he can to try and make up for the damage that he caused to Lea's family.  Lea's mother does not want him to pay with money or physical labor, he wants him to continue to spread the joy and happiness that Lea had when she was alive.  His assignment is to construct and put up four different whirligigs in all four corners of the nation so that Lea could be remembered for what she was and try to bring joy into the lives of many more people.  	I found that this book was very well written.  The only problem with I had with it was that the author, after every chapter that involved Brent and his quest, would put in a story with a random character but in the end it showed how his whirligigs affected their lives.  When I first read this kind of chapter I was confused.  I thought I had missed an important part of the book but I did not.  Once you realize the purpose of these chapters, it is much easier to read and comprehend.      	I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick read.  It isn't a book that you need to get really into in order to keep going.  Throughout the book I wanted to know what would happen with Brent and what his next adventure with the whirligigs would be.  I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars.  It is overall a great idea for a story and very well put together.  I felt myself feeling the same way as Brent did in the book in certain situations.  	If anyone asked me what I thought about this book I would tell them that it is a fantastic story and a great book to read.  This is a book that is full of twists and turns in the life of Brent and the journey he takes.  
 The Dyson low-reach floor tool attachment I ordered worked great.  It fit my Dyson DC14 and was shipped to me as promised.  
 "How will you use your power?" This question is at the core of Mr. Zukav's book. He challenges you to answer it and offers numerous insights that can help you find a constructive answer of a high order.  Karma is personal responsibility to the greatest metaphysical extent. Some - including me - may question this extent, or may scale it down, without reference to reincarnation, or the evolution of individual souls through successive incarnations. They may cast aside this intermediary concept between the Cosmic Soul - the principle of the universe - and its incarnations, human or other. And yet, they may still be at home with Mr. Zukav's worldview as he touches luminously on many fundamental beliefs that are common to the most influential religions and philosophical systems in history.  Karma, in brief, is all about living and healing through love, the highest love, the unconditional kind. This kind of love is consistent with the principle of the universe, of life, which promotes life unconditionally in every life form. It is an invitation to live a life that is beautifully aligned with its principle, with universal and unconditional love. And this entails our promoting life within and without to the best of our abilities. Such a life breeds joy, the deepest joy, because it serves and fulfills its true purpose.  Mr. Zukav makes that point very strongly, if sometimes less intelligibly than I would like. Perhaps my criticism is merely a function of my philosophical stance, which is slightly at odds with the author's belief in reincarnation. His discourse appears at times arcane, laced with a debatable myth. Having said this, I maintain that "The Seat of the Soul" is a valuable book: it offers numerous insights that can help you find a constructive answer of a high order to this pivotal question: "How will you use your power?"  Practically, what can this answer be? How do we conciliate the particular needs of our incarnate or material self with those of every other incarnations on Earth, in a spirit of unconditional love? After all, we are not pure souls - or pure individual forms of the Cosmic Soul - that are completely detached from material concerns. We are each body and soul, which is a challenging mix that calls for a wise terrestrial compromise. Perhaps this motto expresses the best possible attitude: Be a brother or sister of the world and do as much good as you can; and in times of unavoidable conflict with intractable beings, protect your interests while compassionately doing the least harm that you can.  "Attitude" is here the operative word. Mr. Zukav rightly stresses the fact that real power is internal, not external, such as physical or financial power. It is an enlightened way that empowers one to foster dignity and peace in oneself, no matter what the circumstances are.   Like it or not, circumstances are largely beyond one's control. A Do-your-best-and-come-what-may turn of mind is the only fitting one. The reverse is useless; worse, it is harmful. Fear and worry do not add power to one's foolish desire to control everything and always have it one's way. They even undermine one's health, as negative feelings amount to negative energy that robs one of vitality; and illness follows.   The art of living is the balanced art of pursuing and renouncing, of striving for worthy things that one can forgo if worse comes to worse. And this art is never consummate until it is performed with trust, with the unshakable sense that one shares with humanity the same resilient nature that has endured through the ages through thick and thin. Only then can one truly love life. This love entails understanding and accepting that both happiness and suffering are transient. Nothing ultimately remains but the divine creative source from which every creation springs, with the promise of new joys at the cost of new pains. Nothing remains for certain but the principle of the universe, the Cosmic Soul, whose essence is unconditional love for everything and everyone.  Laurent Grenier, author of the book "A Reason for Living." 
 I love crockpot cooking. I can make meals at low cost and little effort. A must buy 
 Because my two cats are indoor cats, we decided to begin feeding them Purina Cat Chow Indoor Formula once they were weaned off kitten chow.  They eat this *right up* and love it! They aren't overweight, and I have confidence in knowing that they're getting their greens with this product. Once in a great while, I'll offer them canned food that's mixed in it, but that's only as an extra treat--not because they won't eat the Indoor Formula.  Highly recommended for cats kept exclusively indoors 
 I can't get over how much I enjoyed reading every word in this book. Hiaasen's dialogue is fantastic and there is never a wasted word, a testament to his journalism background. His dark humor resounds in the book, giving his characters a depth to their shallowness and an erotic edge to some pretty dicey situations 
 Jodie Foster, director David Fincher and the rest of the cast excel at providing loads of suspense in an interesting high concept thriller.  Panic Room derives it's effectiveness and fascination from a very basic human need - the necessity of security and safety. At one point one of the bad guys played by a greasy, corn rowed Jared Leto tells his gang of bumbling burglars that women - referring to a now firmly locked up Jodie Foster in her panic room - need safety and security. He wants to play on that to psych her out of the veritable vault that's preventing him from stealing his family's wealth. I think this sums up alot of why the movie works. There are lots of bad guys out there and at night when we shut the lights and go to sleep, they just might want to break in and prey on us. By having shelter within a shelter - a virtually impenetrable vault to hide - we feel safer, more secure and maybe we're even able to sleep better.  Of course how many of us could afford a panic room? So with this film, we can live vicariously through Foster's character and her daughter as they make a stand against the intruders in their home. Fincher's direction is spot on terrific. He's a director who can evoke Hitchcock effortlessly, while never mimicking the master's style. The intricate camera work which pans over the elaborate and convincing sets may owe alot to digital magic, but it never looks synthetic.  This is one you'll watch again and again. It's full of great, well acted characters and the premise is irresistible. Highly recommended. 
 This colorful cookbook has an easy to read format with photos for every recipe! In the beginning of the book the importance of ingredients used are explained. There are a lot of very creative & tasty recipes to please all your family members! Some unusual recipes such as "pomegranate sorbet," "Lavendar Honey Ice Cream," "Baked Almond Mussels," "Monkfish Kebabs" & more are well worth the effort. I highly recommend this cookbook your family & friends will enjoy these tasty recipes 
 I don't pretend to spend enough time watching movies from the 20th Century long enough to make this statement, but this Friday Soundtrack is pretty damn close to the best I've heard from any movie of any kind.  I will however stand behind proclaiming this the greatest hip hop soundtrack of all-time!  With this CD, you get a movie soundtrack that combines old school soul with new school West Coast hip hop that ruled the better part of the early '90s and fits this movie's 1995 South Central L.A. setting.  Obviously it will help a listener relate and understand the place of each song on this soundtrack by actually watching the movie first -- otherwise, you'll probably take this CD's creative interpretations as nothing more than easy listening for bluntheads and triflin', good-4-nuthin' type of bruthaz who don't have jobs.  This isn't that kind of negative movie -- it's more light-hearted, very funny, very laid back and the soundtrack reflects that.  The soundtrack gets off to a flawless start with two tracks that were and continue to be four-star hip hop bangers: Ice Cube's "Friday" and Dr. Dre's "Keep They Heads Ringin'". Cube's title track basically puts it down as far as talking about the fun, sometimes querky, sometimes violent and hella crazy antics that go down in his 'hood (thus, why you need to see the movie to relate). The other is a smash party/dance track with an adequate Dre rap over a hype, relentless Dre beat (enough said).  Mixed in you get the original recordings of some of "Our parents music" with classics like the Isley Brothers "Tryin' 2 see another day," "You Got me wide open" by Bootsy Collins, the classic Rick James track "Mary Jane" and the soulful, slow love ballad "I Wanna Get Next to You" by Rose Royce.  In between you get fitting tracks from (then) contemporary hip hop acts like Cypress Hill ("Roll It Up, Light It Up"), Threat ("Lettin' N****z Know") and the crunk classic "Hoochie Mama" by 2 Live Crew (one of my personal favs -- LOL, they not rhymin' 'bout all women, but a certain kinda person).  Perhaps the best thing about this soundtrack and really a template for what makes a great soundtrack great is when you have a compilation of appropriate fitting songs that actually relate to scenes, emotions and plots from the movie.  This may sound dubious but too many post-1997 soundtracks -- hip hop-inspired anyway -- totally went away from this formula, turning soundtracks into free for alls for new artists doing mostly tired, throwaway songs that in several cases weren't even featured in the movie.  "Friday" is the quintessential hip hop soundtrack masterpiece 
 I believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. Forget about zoom lenses even if they are L. This lens is far better than 70-200L in my opinion. It is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. With zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens. It is very well built but not excessive heavy, come with hood and bag, but unfortunately, Canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the L lenses.  Combined with a Tamron 1.4X teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom L lenses at 189mm focal length. Yes I know I lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens. But I am really happy that I decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200IS to 135/2L+1.4X. This not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures, especially at wide open. Better portrait lenses, like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8, would cost several thousands of dollars. Trust me, once you play with primes, you will not like zoom anymore.  I am also using a 24-70L to shoot my small kid. After using this lens, I don't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday, the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6X crop factor of digital camera. A 35mm/1.4L will become 56mm which is really not good.  Order from Amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock. They shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated "in stock soon".  Pros: Very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5. Very fast lens with f/2 Very good bokeh (background blurring). Overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color. Smaller size, less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s. It is a L lens: best build quality, fast/quiet ring USM AF with FTM.   Cons: No hard case. No inexpensive. Effective focal length is 216mm on 10D/20D/Rebel/300D which is a little difficult to use for portrait 
 FINALLY! An ice cream cookbook that offers more ideas than just scooping ice cream into a bowl and adding some sauce.  The cookbook is creative, informative and offers options from serving ice cream at a backyard BBQ or for an elegant dinner party.  I have all of Emily Luchetti's cookbooks.  Her ingenious ability to pair different flavors together sets her apart from other chefs.  Start with these recipes you and your friends will love them: gingersnap lemon ice cream sandwiches, fudge cookie and mint chip ice cream sandwiches and s'more ice cream cake 
 I love this soundtrack! It stands alone as beautiful, haunting, alluring, and innocent--just as Griet herself was in the film. Desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story, enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar.  Scarlett Johanssen's acting is superb, as well as Essie Davis and Colin Firth. The story, though, was a bit tired--pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband. Its portrayal of Vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people, even though it is a fictionalized account.  The two best tracks on this album are 'Griet's Theme' and 'Colours in the Clouds'. While I'm not keen on seeing the film again, this soundtrack is a treasure. It's a real work of art, second only to Vermeer's work 
 If you like time travel and want to learn something (the research into this book was phenomenal) this is the one for you. It has it all- romance, action, intrigue, sorrow and even humor.  In a not-so-distant England it seems things have not changed - bad phones (the cell phone would have changed the story dramatically), bad food, dreary, rainy weather, etc. As in many of these tales there are actually two stories - the "real" story of the time traveler and the other of events in the "current" time while they are gone.   Although they were not quite balanced, they were well done.  The "current" story lacks is a counterpoint to the time travel story - humor vs seriousness, modern vs old, sanitation vs dirt, medicine vs myth.  Kivrin, a student, transforms herself (thru much hard work) into a maiden of the 14th century.  She learns the language(s), the customs, how to sew, how to eat, how to dress - whatever could be gleamed from books of that time (and there were not many).  They are careful to place her in 1320, almost three decades before the Black Plague.  But of course, something goes wrong - in this case a wild flu that befuddles the technician and poor Kivrin ends up in 1348, the year the plague reaches England. She herself was sick upon arrival and has no memory of exactly where she arrived which also happens to be the pickup point.    She is taken to a local family for care. Her tales of the sheer grinding awfulness of everyday life were vivd and should cure any fool from talking about the "good old days" prior to industrialization.  People literally lived with the elements - the animals, the snow, the rats, the refuse.  Their conditions make our public housing seem like a Saddam palace.  Yet there were two rays of light: Agnes, a little girl in the house and Father Roche, the illiterate, humble and devout priest of the village.  He saw Kirvin when she arrived, seemingly out of nowhere and assumed she was a heavenly traveler.  The poignant ending is pure cliche but her interaction with the priest hits hard. My grade - A    
 Jimmy Stewart at his best...golly this is a swell movie 
 I am transformed! This music helps take me to another level! The videos are great - the album is well-crafted and the ideal music for your music collection.  "Worlds Apart" is my favorite song and I highly recommend it 
 Every summer I go to Gettysburg to attend a professional education event, and in my off time, I hike the battlefield.  I don't know how I missed  Sears' book up to this point, but I began reading it shortly after returning from Gettysburg this year.  It is the definitive work in regard to the battle.  Sears has obviously done his homework, as he gives not only an account of the battle, but much material regarding the persons and personalities involved, relying on correspondence, memoirs, etc., and basing his work overwhelmingly on primary sources.  The book has been made more real to me as I reflect on where on the battlefield the events unfolding take place, and remember the markers commemorating and memorializing the units and individuals who served and fell there.  Sears' style is such that one can almost place one's self in the midst of each battle and skirmish described, and his description of many of the commanders elicits feelings of sympathy, admiration and disgust, sometimes simultaneously.  Next summer I will again be hiking around the battlefield in mid July, but with a new addition---I'll have Sears' book in my hand to use as a field guide.  I look forward to reading his other works 
 The essays in this book are excellent. Writen by some of the greatest historians, of the First World War 
 If you have seen any of the other Audobon Society Books, you know how good they are.  They provide the necessary information on kinds of animals I've never even heard of.  I like that the book includes color photographs as well 
 Craig Anderton's circuits work. They're easy to build, sound really good and are even useful in HiFi applications. If you like to acquire a firm basic knowledge about music electronics, this is the right book for you 
 Amazon offers free shipping on all of Canon's BCI-6 inkjet inks except the red & green colors (which also ship directly from Amazon.) When asked, I received no reasonable explanation from Amazon. Bummer 
 I have been reading the reviews written on Amazon about this book. Many readers refer to it as a great book, and some as the greatest that they have ever read. This is in stark contrast to the critical evaluation of the work given by professionals, academics primarily. For them Wouk is a ' middle- brow' writer whose powers of character creation, language, are not very great. Here I must confess that ' The Caine Mutiny' is one of those books from which I have a stronger memory from the movie , than from the book itself. Many readers have referred to the masterful character creation of Captain Queeg, of his once contemptible and yet sympathy- arousing character, of the story of the development of Willie Kieth from crude and selfish young man to responsible sailor and hero. Many too suggest that Wouk's ending of the work is masterful. And all point out how wonderfully readable the book is.  My guess is reading it will not only help the reader understand something about American life during the Second War but will also give an insight into American values and attitudes in the 1950's. 
 If you like experimental language and can still be surprised by linguistic expressions you thought to be impossible, you have come to the right place - get this book and read "Three Lives". It is a wonderful collection of short stories about three different women who struggle with life each in their own way, and Gertrude Stein's descriptions express linguistically, what the souls of these girls go through: Torture, boredom, helplessness, violence, love, sexual desire. Has there ever before been such an emotional language? I doubt it. The edition by Mondial (ISBN 978-1595690425 or 1595690425) includes an introduction by "enfant terrible" Carl Van Vechten, an essayist and photographer, who knew Gertrude Stein very well and delivers an interesting insight into her way of writing (and living) and the history of this book 
 I think what people are missing with Rechy's latest -- and what's so expertly done it's nearly invisible -- is the sheer physical bravado of the writing.  What other modern novels move with such lithe speed, evoking the physical world of both the picaresque and the screwball comedy with such wicked glee?  None that I can think of.  Like most great comedy, its seeming slightness is being used against it.  Rechy doesn't linger over anything; he makes his points then moves on.  If he turned lugubrious or ponderous, the praising would never cease!!  But his footing is sure, his cutting wit swift, and his amassed technique does what all technique should do:  it recedes to the (in this case) sheer visual power of the storytelling.... 
 I remember watching this movie a few years back. I thought it was decent overall. But my biggest question is if Jason hated the world so much, why didn't he blow himself up inside the gym 
 This book has offered a very insightful twist to understanding American foreign policy and congressional thought during the Spanish-American and Phillipian-American wars.  Hoganson has given a nice view of how manliness and the fear of losing it contributed to war ideas and how the rise of women's suffrage movements pushed a male dominated political cirle into thoughts of war in order to maintain their manhood.  Very well written and her sources are extensive and flawless 
 Everyone seems to have an opinion on David Crosby. Due to his drug antics, his prison stint, his sperm donating: well, the tabloid stuff seems to outweigh his music career.   This is his great redeeming record, however, a mere 9 song cycle that's worth every penny. Haunting doesn't even begin to describe the sound of it. It has a great early-seventies sound, found on albums by other artists of the time like CSN, Neil Young, the Dead and others. Something about the pre-amps or compressors they were using in studios in those days. Far superior in sound to most of what's around today.  "Music Is Love" is a bit of a pleasant throwaway, admitedly. It's just the warm up. The 7 or 8 minute "Cowboy Movie" is what really launches this record, with Crosby singing crytptically about some incident (a drug bust?) over a funky, spiky riff reminicient of something off of Neil Young's "Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere". "Cowboy Movie" shouldn't work as a song, but it does, and it just sets up what's to come. "Tamalpais High", "Laughing", "What Are Their Names", "Song WIth No Words". Brilliant stuff--Crosby proves that even when he has no lyrics he can get under your skin (like on the jazzy "Tamalpais.."). "Laughing" on here is particularly effective. It's actually the most logical continuation of his work with the Byrds (the "Younger Than Yestarday" and "Notorious Byrd Bros." albums). By the time you come to "Orleans", you will probably already be awed, but "Orleans" is yet another great song. The whole thing wraps up with "I Could Swear There Was Somone Here". The story goes that Crosby laid down that song very sponteneously in about 3 or 4 takes of vocal overdubs (Cros. autobiography "Long Time Gone" has nice info on the recording of this LP, along with amusing tidbits and anecdotes from the engineer Stephen Barncard ). It serves as the perfect closer to this laid-back but very intense and moving album.   This is material that most of Crosby's peers would've killed for. I can't say enough good things about this record--if you're a fan of the Cros. and you haven't heard this, buy it right now. 
 Very huge fine prints and good references. Definitely a must get if you like reading Bibl 
 Volume 1 of a collection of cartoons that highlight Pluto's career from 1930-47. Pluto always seems to attract the small-fry, as his cartoons are aimed squarely at them. Though, Pluto is not one of my favorite Disney characters, his shorts are well animated and executed with the same level of professionalism that was put into any Mickey Mouse or Donal Duck cartoon 
 This is an excellent book. It fundamentally challenges scholars understanding of one of the most interesting party phenomena in industrialized democracies: the long-term dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan. I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in party politics or Japanese democracy. Scheiner is also a gifted writer, so the book is often a pleasure to read 
 Being a lifelong Disney fanatic, I have heard of the Mickey Mouse Club quite often, but never actually seen it.  Until I sat down to watch this set.  Part of the Walt Disney Treasures collection, this two disc DVD set contains the first week's worth of episodes from 1955.  Each of the five episodes runs approximately 47 minutes and are presented in black and white, which is how they were originally filmed and broadcast.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday start off with newsreels.  A foreign concept now, they highlight kids around the world and things they are accomplishing.  Each episode contains another entry in the first series "I Want to Be an Airline Pilot/Hostess" which follows two kids as they get a behind the scenes tour of TWA.  Some of the attitudes are definitely 1950's gender rolls, but considering that's when it was created, nothing else should be expected.  Each episode also contains a Mickey Mouse cartoon.  Since the show was filmed in black and white, the cartoons are black and white as well no matter what their original color release was.  For those looking for the cartoons in color, it's best to look at other Disney Treasures releases.  Each episode also includes the Mouseketeers and the theme of the day.  Monday they get to sing and dance with "The Friendly Farmer" and "The Shoe Song," a couple funny songs.  Tuesday brings guest Wally Boag and his puppet friend doing a show.  Also featured is a balloonist making animals while telling jokes.  When anything can happen on Wednesday, the Mouseketeers form a gadget band with the pans, bottles, and combs found lying around the set.  Thursday features the DeWaynes Acrobats for Circus Day.  Finally, Friday highlights the trumpet talent of Larry Ashurst and Mouseketeer Cubby O'Brien's drumming.  Just now watching these shows as an adult, I must confess I don't quite see the appeal.  Of course, I'm about 50 years too late and at least 20 years too old to be in the target audience.  After the first couple episodes, I was ready to quit.  Then an interesting thing happened.  I started to enjoy them.  Not that I want to sit down and watch every episode ever made of the show, but I was beginning to find something appealing about the hokey songs and antics.  By the end, I was disappointed that I didn't have the next episode to see what happened next in the serial.  No Disney Treasures set would be complete without some kind of bonus features.  Besides the introduction on both discs by Leonard Maltin, disc one features a tribute to head Mouseketeer Jimmie Dodd and disc two features six of the original Mouseketeers (Sharon Baird, Bobby Burgess, Lonnie Burr, Doreen Tracey, Cubby O'Brien, and Karen Pendleton) sharing memories of what it was like to be on the show.  Both are fascinating.  In addition, both discs contain stills galleries of behind the scenes pictures.  Disc two also contains the opening in color (it was filmed in both originally), and some footage of the Mouseketeer performance at Disneyland's opening day.  Some of the Disney Treasures sets are designed with a specific audience in mind.  This set will appeal most to Baby Boomers looking for a reminder of their childhood and confirmed Disney fanatics.  Others probably won't enjoy these five programs from fifty years ago 
 The recipes were fun to make and very southern.  Book is worth having in your kitchen, including for yankees 
 This film should be up there on your need to watch list.  It's a brilliantly casted and wonderfully scripted story of blind love.  When Luis (Bandaras) meets his mail-order-bride Julia (Jolie) he is stunned at her beauty.  She is nothing like he expected, yet he marries her immediatly.  Luis is the perfect gentleman, and that makes Julia's next move even harder.  Once she has gained Luis' trust she leaves him, taking him for every cent.  Luis then, with the help of a P.I., decides he will find her, and kill her.  The problem is that he still loves her.  But does she love him?  This film shows the dark side of love, the side that allows you to love someone you don't even know, but can feel, someone you connect with, someone that makes you whole.  Jolie and Bandaras are spot on (especially with their clothes off...HOT HOT HOT) and they work wonders with this script.  I have watched this film over and over and still can't get enough of it.  The unrated version of this film offers a steamier and much more explicet love scene with movement and lots of nudity (no full frontal Bandaras shots though, you'll have to settle for quite a few butt shots) and it includes a few other sex scenes, less explicet, that were cut from the movie entirly.  Either way you'll be pleasently pleased.  The unrated version doesn't add anything new to the plot and or the flow of the film so pursue only if you're in dire need for a near-porn-like nude scene...otherwise, the theatrical version is just fine (and you still see quite a bit of nudity)...Great acting, great story, great bodies...what can I say but Great movie 
 Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones' WHY SHOULD ANYONE BE LED BY YOU? WHAT IT TAKES TO BE AN AUTHENTIC LEADER  tells why simply copying leadership strategies isn't a guarantee of success - and how authentic leadership resides in individuals who display their authenticity to others. Examples throughout illustrate over twenty-five years of joint experience between the authors who use their research, consulting experience and leadership skills to argue for the merits of authentic leadership and how to achieve it. 
 I am nearly done reading this book and find it excellent, wonderful.  I haven't painted in years and am looking forward to starting again.  This book is very detailed in explanations of materials and techniques.  Perfect for the beginner or intermediate painter.  I think an experienced artist would already be aware of these techniques and would have done a great deal of experimentation already, but this is great for the rest of us 
 This DVD showcasing Kenny Chesney on the road is excellent.  Kenny is interviewed as well as his road crew and band members.  Kenny is great because he seems in touch with his roots and his fans.  This is a must buy for any Kenny Chesney fan 
  	Michael Jordan has made many leaps and bounds in his career. He's gone from a huge basketball player to a successful baseball player. "Salt in his Shoes" is a great book because it explains how Michael never gave up. The lesson is great and the illustrations are amazing.  	In the book, Michael never gave up, and he was determined. This helped him win the game. He also believed in himself. Even though he wasn't that tall, his passion for the game meant more. Michael has also been very successful. He was on a famous basketball and baseball team.  	We think this story is wonderful because it teaches a great lesson, to never give up. Also, to believe in yourself. It shows that if you keep trying, you can become anything you want. Also, the pictures are vivid and colorful 
 In 2005, the local radio station started playing the song "Rock And Roll Queen" by The Subways for the first time. At first, I thought they sounded like the Ceasers, but I quickly learned that this British band meant buisness, and they were INSANELY better than the Ceasers. Waiting for 3 months was hard, and I finally bought the English version on accident (what can I say, I couldn't wait an extra month for it to come out). The only difference, I believe, is that on the American version, the Encore At 1 AM is a separate song. I am uncertain, but I do know this:  the subways is my new favorite band. This CD is incredibly amazing and after listening to it mulitple times, I have grown to like it more and more. It's upbeat antics and slow refreshing tunes have more than astounded me and my taste in music. The three 19 year olds have surely made an impact in my life, and I HIGHLY encourage buying this CD  favorite tracks: I Want To Hear..., Holiday, Rock And Roll Queen, Mary, Lines Of Light, Oh Yeah, With You, She Sun, Somewhere, and At 1 A 
 My students are constantly borrowing this book to prepare for interviews on Wall Street.  Aside from the desire for preparing for interviews, the book is interesting on its own because it forces the reader to use very simple logic in many cases to answer what appear to be complex questions.  Many times, it teaches the reader that examining the question is more critical to finding an answer than automatically jumping into complex mathematical logic 
 Lilian Jackson Braun's tenth cat book starts off with the death of one of the most beloved long-time characters in the series. It is quite a testament to Braun's writing ability that I felt so saddened by this person's death and I was indeed quite upset. It is not clear early on if this death is a murder or a simple heart attack but as usual, Qwilleran is suspicious. Braun has the ability to make her readers feel as if they know the people of Moose County and have lived there for years and this is what is so endearing about this series. This story also starts out with Qwilleran telling the story in the first person which is a new twist and fortunately one that just sort of melts away early in the book.   As in previous stories the mystery is mostly a background for another tale of Moose County but this time there are only two deaths to deal with. Among the more memorable characters to wander in and out of this story are ninety-four year old Homer Tibbitt and his slightly younger girlfriend Rhoda, who refuses to get her hearing aide fixed. One of their conversations culminates with Homer yelling at Rhoda, "I said potties-not poppies!" This conversation sent me into fits of laughter and is typical of Braun's wonderful writing style.   Like all small rural communities, Moose County has it's secrets, one of which Qwilleran uncovers while puzzling over his friend's death. It turns out that one of the area's most famous incidents was all a fake and that at least one Moose County resident had lived long past his funeral. A secret that in the end will remain locked away in Qwilleran's mind and in the secret compartment of a Dingleberry desk.   As is the case in most of these books, Koko tries to give Qwilleran clues but time and again the former reporter looks over the hints. Once the mystery is solved however, Qwilleran realizes once again that his highly intelligent feline has had things figured out for quite some time. If only Qwilleran could warm up to his girlfriend's new cat, who he refers to as Bigfoot, as quickly as he warmed up to the goat farmer next door. This tenth trip into the wild and wonderful world of Jim Qwilleran is a journey well worth taking, even if there is more Moose than mystery 
 The Hades Moon is a "must read" book for anybody with Moon-Pluto aspects in their chart. You will never think of this aspect in the same way again. With its fascinating case studies ( the Kennedy family, John Lennon,  the Bronte family and more) it is a compelling read.It is a very profound  book that delves into the depths of the plutonian experience,revealing not  only the darkness and pain of Moon -Pluto but all its phenomenal  pontential. I loved it and it changed me deeply 
 Nothing's sacred to David Sedaris, as fans of his have come to discover and appreciate. His entire family is a sacrificial lamb to his sometimes scathing sense of humor, and anyone who crosses his path the wrong way is thrown onto the pyre just as quickly. Sedaris dissects people to the point of making them caricatures, and yet they always ring true, no matter how ridiculous. My favorite example is from the essay "Planet of the Apes," in which a young David hitchhikes home from the movie theatre, and accepts a ride from a crass old woman who asks him to "just tell me where you live, Pinocchio, and save the baloney for lunch." Regardless of whether people actually speak this way, all of us can say we've met some form of this woman, and David nails her in this description.  Sedaris is good for leading his readers through his own form of literary slapstick and then hitting them with some sad truth in the end. He does this quite well in "The Drama Bug," in an odd moment of admiration (instead of lampoon) of his mother, and "Get Your Ya-Ya's Out!" with an equally tender look at his often-satirized father.   Underneath the jokes and the bearing of dirty little secrets is a genuine love in the Sedaris family, which keeps these essays from sinking into either too-dark humor or a general "Mommie Dearest"-like look back in anger. Sedaris's family may drive him crazy, but the feeling is mutual, and that levels the playing field a bit. 
 Dick Cheney was quoted by several publications as loving this book. Pretty spooky seeing the many lies and fabrications that are being told about the Iraq war and 9/11. If you truly care about people of the 3rd world and hate imperialist slime like this administration, you owe it to yourself to be educated on the enemy, by reading things like this book 
 A great storyline leads to many action packed scenes in this movie.  Jason Statham is very believable as an action movie star.  Excellent fight scenes that look very authentic.  Sure there are some cheezy moments here but all the great action makes up for that.  
 Tony Hillerman once again takes us into the world of the Navajo with Jim Chee and the legendary Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police. I read this for the first time some years ago, and this entry in the long-running series is very exciting. It has a lot of atmosphere and Leaphorn and Chee are fleshed out more than usual in this terrific read.  Both Chee and Leaphorn are dealing with personal issues as this one begins. Chee hasn't quite figured out how he feels about Mary leaving him because he could not leave his Navajo way of life behind and move to the city with her. He is smitten with a pretty Navajo attorney named Janet but she's with someone else. Leaphorn meanwhile, is on terminal leave and retiring after the unexpected death of his beloved wife Emma. Niether he or Chee can explain his obsession with finding a missing pot hunter named Eleanor Friedman-Bernal. No Navajo would be involved, as stealing pots like this would make one a "Thief of Time" according to Navajo tradition.  Chee's letting a rather large backhoe get stolen right from under his nose will have ties to Leaphorn's investigation, and once more Chee will be helping Leaphorn all across the Navajo territory. This one will stretch all the way into Utah and down the San Juan River. Leaphorn will be reminded of a young boy's death by drowning before this one wraps up, and it will have unexpected ties to his search for Eleanor.  It seems Eleanor was looking for pots made by the Anasazi, a tribe that simply vanished from the face of the earth. Pictographs and petroglyphs of Kokopelli, the "Watersprinkler," will play a vital part in this mystery. But Eleanor's interest is also anthropological, and someone thinks what she's discovered is worth killing for.  Leaphorn and Chee will be hundreds of miles apart when they reach the same conclusion in this complex mystery. One will have to race to the other as things turn ugly, and two very different men will find commom ground when Leaphorn asks the unexpected of young Chee.  Hillerman's descriptions of the thousand foot cliffs along the San Juan River at night, under a sky filled with Navajo mystery, will enthrall you. This is a good mystery and quite possibly the best in the series. You don't want to miss this one 
 This is a great book for anyone who would like to start making a few environmentally-responsible changes in their life, but arent quite ready to jump into a full vegan-greenpeace style life.  It gives ideas that allow you to help the environment (and your wallet), without really disrupting life as you know it. Everything from kitchen and bath, to outdoor maintenence, to organic methods to get rid of household pests. 
 Running into Theo Grutter's book is like running into Jean Liedloff's Continuum Concept: meeting a mind that has come independently to be in synch with my own. This doesn't mean he's saying things I've said or thought. On the contrary, he continually surprises me with things I haven't said or thought. And he says them well and wittily. Of our frenetic "get ahead" lifestyle that robs our souls to fill our houses with gaudy trinkets: "Is it not the madness of the fool who day after day falls into the same pit, yet is wholly proud to know the trick of how to climb out of it day after day?" Of the congratulation we award ourselves for our humanitarian greatness in the Third World: "A versatile mind might want to scrutinize with an ecologically-minded eye the greatness of our great white jungle doctors. A truly modern mind that thinks also with a third eye placed generations away might then note that this humanitarian greatness nicely exploding our population there can ultimately cast a great shadow over the flora and fauna of the jungle and stop its people from singing and dancing." Composed of very brief essays, this is a book to spend a few minutes with every day, a book for your bedside table. Readers who cherish my work will cherish Dancing with Mosquitoes 
 We own many, many, many children's books and all 7 of our children agree this is the very best one!  Everyone should own it, just to see how enchanted Corgies really are and to see the fun at the Corgiville Fair.  We also really like the rabbits who are diving into the pond and the use of chickens in the place of horses is to funny 
 This pillow is exactly what I was looking for in a memory foam pillow.  It's supportive, regular pillow shaped, not too tall, etc.  My only complaint was the horrible smell of the latex (or whatever it is) foam.  I understand this is common with these pillows.  So, I washed it in the bathtub with a small amount of mild detergent.  It took nearly a week to completely dry (no wringing the foam!).  However, once it was dry, No Smell!  Thereafter I've been pleased with my pillow.  I'll definitely purchase another one whenever this one reaches its end of life 
 And proof positive that talent begets talent. Owen King has a bright future ahead of him if this first book is any indication. His richly drawn characters, unexpected humor and insight into what keeps us linked made me wish there was more of his work to read 
 I love this CD.  I have always felt silling trying to meditate at home, but have been using this in the car during my commute to and from home.  No, I am not zoning-out while driving!  I just chant along with Wayne & find myself calmer and more centered when I arrive at my destination.  It's a great way to "shed the workday" before you get home 
 I completely disagree with the earlier review about the quality of reproductions in this work.  The colors are stunning, and this book is so well organized and detailed that it makes it a real pleasure to dive into.   Nothing can compare to seeing these inspirational works in person, but if  you saw the show, you have to have this book.  If you missed the show, you  have to have this book.  Lose yourself in these paintings and you will find  so much...personal revelation, power and resolve.  Its a must-own for the  true Rothko fan 
 I picked up this novel when a couple of friends recommended it.  Usually I am wary of first-time authors that I have not heard of, especially when you are paying for the hardcover!  It ended up being the best money I've spent towards entertainment lately. Philip Donlay's fully formed characters and plot meshed together to create a debut that is certain to make other authors in the genre very nervous.  I would compare this book to works by Michael Crichton. It is full of interesting science and aviation details that adds to a unique and credible story line. The last few chapters were extremely intense - don't pick this book up late at night 
 Collins'analysis of black feminism is an enlightening piece of literature that forces its readers to chanllenge main stream assumptions and discover the underlying mechanisms of racism and sexism in America. To create this  effect, she uses a range of feminist perspectives form the calm subtleties  of Angela Davis to the slightly boisterous philosopy of Bell Hooks.  Nevertheless, by displaying these perspectives equally Collins shows that  the struggle for equally is not an individual struggle but one that  requires collectively.  This book is intensely thought provoking and it is  guaranteed to give its readers profound insight into black feminism 
 I had read a little about Lorenzo and a lot about the Medici, so it was nice to come upon a book that focuses on the Medici and how Lorenzo the Magnificent ruled.  Martines has done a superb job in portraying the facts behind the Pazzi Conspiracy.  It starts off a little slow, leaving the reader to wonder when the author would ever get to the actual conspiracy, but when he does everything comes together.  By the time the book ends you are left with both sympathy and hatred for both the Pazzi and the Medici.  Sympathy because of the savage way they were attacked, following up with the nod of approval of the reprisals Lorenzo took (although they were a bit extreme).  And hatred for the tyranny that Lorenzo and his house brought down upon the republic of Florence.  The same for the Pazzi, for they were suppressed, and thus sympathy was on their side, but the savage destruction they wrought upon their own family and others in order to satisfy their lust for power leaves a distaste in their wake.  There is some "filler", it would seem at a quick glance, but when delved in deeper it is evident that these "filler" chapters do in fact help our understanding of why and how the Pazzi Conspiracy happened.  The profile chapters, although they don't touch upon the conspiracy directly, add weight to the notion and feeling that went behind the affronted patricians of Florentine society.  The political chapters added substance and understanding to the why and how of the reasons behind the conspiracy.  So the "filler" chapters do in fact add a lot to the telling of this dramatic time in history.  All sides were represented, which makes this a very well rounded history book.  I think that the Pazzi Conspiracy should be required reading for history students, and for amateurs alike, and April Blood would be a great starting point.  My only complaint is that I wish Martines would have documented his sources better, rather than the more difficult to navigate way that he did.  All in all, a definite recommend.  5 stars. 
 Go buy this book.  You'll read it over and over - and laugh every single time.  Bridget Jones is my hero.  She tries so hard to be perfect... but poor thing, she is like the rest of us - woefully insecure and less than perfect.  Almost everyone has seen the movie which was excellent, but the book is twice as good.  If you love romantic comedies, you'll love Bridget Jones 
 This book is one of those rarities that can delight passionate history buffs, professional historians, serious field explorers, and armchair travelelers alike.  The authors have skillfully drawn on nearly every worthwhile source on King Philip's War to create a fascinating and readable text.  What's really great, though, is the photos, maps, and place descriptions. You might live over 350 years later and most of a continent away but they still give you a strong sense of "being there" during one of the greatest white-Indian showdowns of American history 
 Mt daughter is now 22 years old and expecting my first grandchild in December. We discussed buying the child books and asked my daughter what her favorit book was when she was little. She immediately said "Old Hat, New Hat'. She said she loved the voices I made each time the bear tried on a new hat. This is the first book I will buy for my "to be" grandchild. For her to remember this book after more than 20 years says a lot about the quality of the book. A classic!  
 Hi folks , its Vince the radioman . I have a large collection of radios and I love to do compares . I am a hobbiest with a vast array of antennas and filters and I test all radios with and without the assistance from my additional equipment . This is a very nice , sleek , compact fully functional radio with complete coverage 150khz to 29999khz. It has a very sensative tuning section which is great for DXing . The selectivity and sensativity is top notch , however , as mentioned by other reviewers it also seems to be more sensative to noise . There is no filters or SYNC feature . The SONY SW7600 which is the same price is truly a better radio, period!It has SYNC and up front filters that eliminate noise and the SYNC feature is crucial for true DXing  .My Grundig YB 400 is also good but I have had better results , especially on AM with the E5 and especially when I hook the E 5 up to my antenna/filter system .  The SSB is top notch ! Very good results without an addional antenna , clear and distinct. Curiously I wonder why this model has been claimed by ...Eton , Grundig , Degan and Kaito ...it appears that there is "one " manufacturer in the far east and companies scranmble to bid on putting there name on their products!!? Non the less the E5 and the G5( Grundig version , BTW the AC adaptor on the G5 does not hum)appears to be an improved Kaito 1103, nice job ! The Eton e1 , e10 and e100 are all of the same design , the E5 is not of this design . The E10 has an IF filter and an antenna trim . The E5 does not but certainly needs it .The durable feel and solid construction is also missing on the E5 unlike the E1,10 and 100 which are solid galvanized rubber , the E5 is plastic. Its has a very good sound both from the built in speaker and the headphones.It has a nice backlight set up ( lights automatically when you touch the tuning dial) and robust memory. Its a solid 4 star radio ...very good! However , the SONY SW7600 is a much better buy for the money  
 I thought that I would end up just browsing through this book looking at the pictures. Instead, I found a great deal of information in the easy-to-read text. The introductory material is interesting. After that, many games are covered in chronological order. Boy, did it bring back memories. I recall encountering a lot of the same information at the time, lending some credibility to the material. Great history of arcade and home games during a formative decade of the genre. Recommended 
 i thought it was really good. i didn't read any of the other mini series leading up, and it wasn't too hard to figure it out. reading countdown to crisis issue helped i guess. i thought this was great. not as good as identity crisis. i'm probably not as hardcore into comics as some of the other reviews(and honestly, i think the hardcore fan boys are the ones who don't like it). the characterization was fine i thought. way more on target than marvel's civil wa 
 When I read Savannah from Savannah and found out there was a sequel I wondered if it was possible to keep the same wit, style, pace a beauty of characters that had so captured me in Savannah. But Undone took me to an even different place. It gave me the opportunity to dig deeper into the well of Savannah and to honestly dig deeper into myself.  For all of the "politically" motivated perspectives on "The Ten Commandment" issue I found this offering to bring a refreshing approach to a very polarizing topic. If you're looking for brain science you won't get it. If you're looking for a political agenda despite some of the reviewers comments you don't get that either. What you get is a honest voice on how the Ten Commandments are broken in every day life. That I believe is at the core of this book. I have to be honest, whether, liberal or conservative, for or against, the issues of monuments being in "public" places this book just deals with the issue of our heart. If that offends people, I'm not sure that is the author who has the proble 
 Every Catholic should have this book. Every Christian open for dialogue with other faiths should have this book 
 MGM supplies a double dose of Price and Poe with this Midnight Movies release of The Tomb of Ligeia (1965) and An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe (1970).  The Tomb of Ligeia, directed by Roger Corman, was his last of the popular Poe series of films, and Corman certainly went out in style.  Opting for shooting on location rather than use of soundstages, the production here is lavish and infinitely enjoyable.  The story centers on Verden Fell (Vincent Price), who lives in a run down abbey, with his wife, Ligeia, buried within the grounds.  But is she actually dead?  It was said her will was so strong, her desire to live so palpable, that maybe she didn't really pass.  Elizabeth Sheppard also stars as Lady Rowena Trevanion, a woman who has a chance meeting with Verden, and soon finds herself enthralled with the man, despite his peculiarities, like his aversion to sunlight, his living in an abandoned abbey, etc.  They are soon married, and then the weirdness really begins.  Strange dreams, a black cat, Verden mysteriously disappearing in the night, and a sense that Verden's deceased wife, while not around in a physical sense, is somewhere in the abbey...maybe everywhere in the abbey, as her presence seems to permeated the structure, and it doesn't seem like she's too happy about Verden getting re-married...so what's the secret behind Verden's strange behavior?  Is Ligeia really dead?  What is the menacing presence lurking within the abbey, intent on haunting Lady Rowena?  As I've said, this is a really wonderful production full of rich, beautiful location shots.  The decrepit abbey is provides a wonderful backdrop to this truly creepy story, and the minimal number of characters really helps to keep things tight and focused.  Price, one of my favorite actors, does a wonderful job, and seeing him apply his craft is always a treat.  Elizabeth Sheppard certainly manages to hold her own, sharing much screen time with price.  What I found really interesting was the lack of physical horror within the film, and how the film avoided the luridness of some of the other Corman/Poe productions, seeming to stay more along the lines of the source material.  Credit must be given to the write of the screenplay, Robert Towne, who later wrote the Nicholson/Polanski classic Chinatown (1974).  A real nice adaptation with loads of atmosphere and a nice way for Corman to finish the Poe series with this eighth and final adaptation.  The second feature on this disc, An Evening with Edgar Allan Poe, isn't a theatrically released feature, but a made for TV movie starring Vincent Price.  It's comprised of four vignettes, including the more popular Poe stories, The Tell Tale Heart, The Sphinx, The Cask of Amontillado, and The Pit and the Pendulum..Price is the only one throughout the entire feature, sometimes acting in a manner of relating a tale within character in the story, sometimes acting out the different characters within the stories.  It's a very personal affair, and all tales follow the original stories very closely, something that wasn't necessarily true of the theatrical Poe features produced by Roger Corman starring Price.  As far as I can tell, Corman had nothing to do with this production, but it was produced by American International, the same company that produced the Corman/Poe films.  This feature runs 53 minutes.  Since it was shot for television on video tape, the quality isn't all that great, but, if you are a fan of Price and/or Poe's works, then this will be a real treat for you.  Price really sinks his teeth into the roles, relating each tale with flourish they so richly deserve.  The print provided for The Tomb of Ligeia looks really beautiful, presented in wide screen.  The special features include two, separate audio commentary tracks, one with Roger Corman, and another with star Elizabeth Sheppard.  There is also a theatrical trailer for the film.  An Evening with Edgar Allan Poe is in full screen format since it was a feature made for television, and does have subtitles, which came in useful as the audio, while decent, was a bit weak at points.

 It is great to be able to read all the avenger comics again. I read them as a kid, but didn't get to read the very beginning. I hope that they bring out more of the comic book characters on DVD. I will buy more 
 Works like a champ!!  I'm having a lot of trouble with nonprofit groups calling to fundraise.  Repeated calls to their membership offices yielded no relief and I hate to simply not give money to worthy causes in order to stop their dial-a-beggars.  (I still will give money, but I had one group calling me eight times a day!  Enough!!)  What's worse is that a lot of these groups also raise money by selling the names and addresses of their donors to similar groups, so you really wind up getting a lot of calls.  I got my TeleZapper for around $10, installed it four days ago, and believe me, it is already paying off.  A dozen calls a day from the dreaded "toll free number" or "out of area" callers have now dwindled to nearly zero.  I use caller ID with mine as well, so hopefully I'd be able to simply return a call from an organization I actually would want to speak to.    I'm leaving off one star because my Zapper is LOUD - when you pick up the phone it emits those three tones that are at the beginning of most phone company "we're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected" recordings, and if you're not careful to wait a second or two before putting it to your ear it'll blow your mind.  There may be some way to turn it down, though.  It'd be swell if you could simply press a switch to make it do its thing instead of having to listen to the tones on every call, but it's a small price to pay for freedom from incessant 800-number calls.  I'll tell you this - I'll not be without one of these gizmos again.  I couldn't find any other workable options - my phone company won't allow customers to block calls on an individual basis.  Now I can read a book or watch a program without being interrupted by fundraisers.  Thanks Telezapper!  Let me know when you guys develop a program that'll get me off the mailing lists of all the solicitors, too...: 
 Ok, the plot is a little wacky and unbelievable, but the dialog was so funny.  I was laughing out loud so much, my family made me leave the room.  Sandra's humor really shown through on this book.  I had trouble believing some of the plot in regards to the Navy Seals program, but take this book for what it is - a humorous romance novel.   I've read many books from Sandra and I've liked them all, but this book made me laugh out loud more than any of the others 
 I was worried about not liking this movie. I'd read a lot of Reviews that said it was weird or boring. But I love Joe Strummer so I had to check it out. and I was pleasantly surprized to find a quirky laugh out loud movie. IT Is a DARK comedy. and you'll either love it or hate it, get it or not. I only gave 4 stars because Courtney Love annoys me she's the only downside to the movie, but her part isn't hugh so it's bareable. I loved seeing Strummer playing a cool sexy guy, he had some great funny moments. Shane Macgowan made me crack up when ever he's on screen. I was also surprized to see some actors in it that are now recgnizable from their recent work like an actor from medium and one from 24. Give this movie a chance and you'll be rewarded 
     The book Olive's Ocean has a lot of detells and I can understand it a lot. I think you should read it because it is funny and in some parts of the book it might make you cry. In some parts of the book it was kind of boing and some parts it feels like you are right in the book with the characters. The chapters are not that long and I like short chapters because I do not like reading a lot at once. The was about a girl that dies and her name is Olive. Martha wrights a story about Olive while she is at her grandmother's house. Martha does not know how to tell her parents that she likes to wright. Martha finds out that there is this kid that likes her but he really does not. Martha thinks Jimmy like her but his brother Tate really is the one who likes her 
 beautifully written, this book is useful for anyone studying any kind of martial art or any art where high level of skill is required. 
 Admittedly, I first read Tally's Corner almost three decades ago -- and it still has a hold over me.  In those 30 years, I went from studying sociology to making films to doing start-ups in Silicon Valley.  I am now in the process of ordering more copies to distribute to friends.  Tally's Corner is an exceptional work.  It had its origins in a doctoral thesis and yet it reads like a novel.  Its powerful message aside, Tally's Corner is marvelous reading.  Anyone who wants to write something important and lasting should look to Liebow to see how it is done.  Tally's Corner defies the contrary logic which says "no pain, no gain" -- that all things profound must to be impossible for everyman to understand 
 Finally I have found a book that departs thoroughly from the corporate model of leadership and embraces fully a unique Biblical model!  Blanchard here goes deeper than just leading -- he speaks of being a leader and growing other leaders.  Spirituality in this author's approach is vital -- it is not something that appears to be a mere overlay on a secular paradigm.  I love reading titles on leadership, but have long felt there was something much more than just a Christianized version of secular theory.  Blanchard identifies and defines a uniquely Christian approach, and does so in a very clear, readable fashion.  This volume is the best book on Christian leadership I have read to date 
 Having had the opportunity to study personally with Victoria Edwards, the author of this lovely compilation of ancient wisdom concerning Aromatherapy, I am greatful for the organization of the information in her  book. In studying with Victoria I can vouch for her life-long devotion to  the study, practice and teaching of Aromatherapy but it was, at times,  difficult to tell where in the forest we were in the study as we delved  deeply into the various facets of this discipline. Her book conveys the  esoteric aspects of Aromatherapy while organizing it in a comprehensive  manner so that one also attains a sense of history of this important  healing art as well as a sense of direction and orientation during your  study. A must on the shelf of any serious devotee of Aromatherapy yet  written clearly and concisely providing an excellent manual for the  beginner as well 
 "Is Wal-Mart god or bad?  The answer is surprising for both its simplicity and also for its power:  Wal-Mart is something utterly new."  (pg. 221)  Having gone through a good deal of information on the Wal-Mart phenomenon, I found this book to be something many other books have not been...objective.  I am no lover of the store and its practices, but it was refreshing to read from an author who did not appear to have an "agenda" on the subject.  That said, I was reading intently to find out what conclusions he reached.  Partly, Fishman believes that until Wal-Mart starts disclosing its numbers to the world, we cannot clearly know what its impact is.  That in itself is not exactly mind-blowing stuff, but if the real point of writing the book is to let us know that the impacts of this corporation are indeed far reaching, Fishman succeeds.    Most of America shops and lives without thinking of the long term consequences of their buying habits, good or bad.  This book takes a well-informed look at many different perspectives on the giant and why it is really so different from previous or concurrent mega-corporations...and why it matters.  
 I highly recommend this paper. I managed a high end pro photo lab for 10 years and now that I am a hobbyist and like to print at home this is my favorite paper to use. Just be sure to load it in the printer correctly. If you print on the wrong side it looks very bad

       In his book The Waffen SS: Hitler's Elite Guard at War George Stein posits that contrary to the popular belief, the SS was not a homogeneous band of killers that did nothing but persecute the Jews during Hitler's reign and had no real military value. Instead, he suggests that the Waffen SS was a dynamic organization which, in the face of war, evolved into the most highly developed and most efficient militarized army of the Nationalist Socialist movement, playing a role for which it was never intended. According to Stein, it was the SS, not the Nazi party that proved to be the dynamic core of the "movement". 	The Waffen SS: Hitler's Elite Guard at War is a very well written book in which Stein sheds light on the often times mysterious and notorious Schutzstaffel. Stein takes us back to its inception and progresses forward through history, showing how the organization's structure and mandate gradually evolved during the Third Reich. Stein reveals the factors which set the Waffen SS apart from the Army, detailing its successes and failures in battle, and the role it played in the military exploits of the Third Reich. 	Stein's thesis is broken up into three distinct points which are supported in different sections of the book and then tied together in his conclusion. The first contention of his thesis is that the Waffen SS was a dynamic and ever evolving organization. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the SS grew from 25,000 to 150,000 men. According to Stein this six-fold increase marked the beginning of an expansion that would result in the establishment of the SS as the "fourth branch of the Wehrmacht". Furthermore, Stein maintains that the SS cannot be painted as a uniform institution of terror. Stein acknowledges that the SS was responsible for a large number of the war-crimes committed by the Third Reich but argues that "only a minority of men that passed through the ranks of the Waffen SS were involved in any of the known atrocities" (281). Stein also states that contrary to popular belief, the SS was also quite dynamic in its personnel composition. By 1945, of the 38 SS divisions, none were composed solely of native Germans and 19 divisions consisted primarily of foreign nationals. 	The second part of Stein's thesis is that the Waffen SS played a role in WWII for which it was not originally intended. Stein states that the SS was originally designed to be Hitler's elite guard and militarized police force, not the elite combat arm of the Wehrmacht that it evolved into. Stein goes on to say that Hitler only wanted the Waffen SS to be an example for the Army, only fighting on the front now and then to retain the respect of the people. Yet the Waffen SS were relied on more and more as the war progressed, becoming an integral and indispensable part of Hitler's offensive operations. "The Third Reich would have collapsed much sooner had it not been for the elite SS divisions" (293). During the last two years of the war, the Waffen SS fought on all four fronts. 	The third and final part of Stein's thesis holds that it was the SS, not the Nazi party that proved to be the dynamic core of the movement. Stein maintains that the SS was tied more to Hitler (All SS personnel swore an oath to Hitler himself) and the movement than to the state or the party like the Army.  "It would be more accurate to describe the Waffen SS as the dictator's private army or Praetorian Guard rather than as a party army." (26) 	In summary, I think there was a general lack of evidence for his postulation that it was the SS, not the Nazi party that proved to be the dynamic core of the movement, but Stein more than makes up for it in his detailed analysis of the Waffen SS and its changing role in WW2 from an elite guard unit to the highly effecting combat arm of the Wehrmacht 
   The Rough Face Girl is a beutiful book.  It had alot of description and many morals hidden in the words of the book.  The young girl was despised by everyone in her village but she always stayed true to herself and others and she ended up with the best person that every girl wanted to marry.  I learned that true beauty comes from inside and if you are honest then good things will happen to you.  I also learned to be yourself because sooner or later people will start to accept who you are.  And I learned to remember that there is always room for improvment.  So in conclusion, I feel that this story can be enjoyed by young and old people 
 First, I have seen the Defender, I told myself this guy will be a good director and I have seen this movie and I am saying again: Dolph is a better director than many of the directors of the big budget movies.  This movie is a kind of revenge movie. Some scenes reminded me Wild Bunch. It is Kill them all movie but it is different. There is something special about this movie. Maybe colors, but probably it is about camera moves. I don't know. See this movie if you like action movies 
 Cliff Notes have always been a useful study tool.  While this book lacks the details that make Joseph Andrews humorous, it does give a brief background as to the events and characters interactions in each chapter.   While I would not recommend this book as a replacement to reading the  actual novel, it is an excellent study guide 
 I was quite surprised by the reality of the book.  It hit me hard.  I then realized that women were desperately oppressed in earlier days.  I thought we had it bad now...  Oh boy was I wrong.  I will pass this on to my  daughter-if I ever decide to have one...  : 
 Once again Mr. Updike delivers an insightful story of life in suburbia and what lurks in the hearts and minds of men and women  - love, lust, betrayal, self doubt.  Villages relates Owen's life as only John Updike can.  The last chapter gets a little too long and not as enjoyable as the rest of the book, but I will certainly recommend it to all my friends 
 Words cannot describe how this musical giant has lifted me up. I have a great appreciation for Mr. Bacharach's music and have just purchased,   'What The World Needs Now.' I enjoyed this CD tremendously, as all the songs are top notch.  Just wait until you hear the medley at the end, for it blows you away with an electrifying climax sending the listener into shivers of admiration and pleasure. May God continue to bless Burt Bacharach, and may he continue to thrill audiences the world over. Very highly recommended!!!  Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar  (SUGAR-CANE 24/04/07 
 I've been a fan of Hank's since his days at the Austin American-Statesman. Before and after I lived in DC, I've always searched the Washington Post's website to find his work. He is a rare talent, able to suss out the story from even the most bland of subjects (discount funeral homes, vacant parking lots, collectors of kitsch, Catholics, Miss America and, even, Willmington, DE). It's always funny, sometimes moving and consistently amazing 
 I can count on reading this book to my 17 month old at least once a day.  The pictures are amazing and text is short enough to keep my daughter's attention; after hearing this book read to her so often, she can now recite certain words at the correct times.  She even gives the baby a kiss on the last page!  Her "personal library" consists of over 40 books and she can spot this one on the shelf in a heartbeat.  I definitely recommend this book 
 For the Mary Tyler Moore lovers these TV shows are great. No need to wait to watch this on TV Land. Just pop in a DVD and you're there in Minneapolis, MN at the TV station with many hilarious moments to chuckle at and enjoy. This is good clean fun if you can stand it. : 
 Greene's easy-to-comprehend summary of physics up to now (2005) is a great read for everyone who is interested in what goes on behind the scenes of our everyday world. It's also a must-read for people who liked to be in awe of the knowledge that modern physicists are uncovering and how much more there is to know. If you thought you had a pretty good understanding of how the world and universe works (outside of physics), this book will boggle your mind.  Greene's style is to bring some very far-out theories in physics down to Earth with analogies to X-Files situations and Bart Simpson adventures. These can be entertaining and very helpful to the scientifically untrained mind. Still there are parts that require the reader to concentrate and try to follow some very intense concepts.  I liken this to a modern-day 'Cosmos,' which was astronomer Carl Sagan's monumental book and television series. It's important for everyone to read books like these if not for the direct impact quantum physics and string theory has on us, but for the imagination and inspiration it can stir in the reader. We are learning so much, especially the fact that we have everything to learn 
 This book is really worth the price. It is very well ilustrated and the key for rock and mineral identification is precise enough to help you find the name and properties of the rocks you find. Of course it is not meant for the professional geologist but it represents a great guide for all beguinners or amateur geologists 
 If comprehensive is what you want, this should make you happy.  The problem is that if you follow every bit of advice in this book you will have to quit your job and make finding your place a full time endeavor (or spend years part time). The advice is all good, but it almost makes the task seem more daunting, not less. Still great for learning all the issues and things to look out for, then you decide how much effort to put into footwork before buying your piece in the countr 
 Hey ladies.  If you'd like to have a nice night alone with your lover have a couple of drinks and watch The Girl.  The plot isn't the best, the story telling can be slow, and at times it's poorly edited....BUT...the love scenes are very HOT!!  The women who play the Painter and The Girl are beautiful and their on screen chemistry is very believable. There's even a brief full frontal scene bordering on the edges of soft porn. If you and yours like beautiful women that love women The Girl will add some heat to your own life.  Have Fun! :. 
 A very moving book that provides personal histories regarding the suffering of Christians in the Middle East.  The book is full of pathos.  It provides an insight (understanding may be unfortunately impossible) of the effect of the Israeli-Palestine conflict on the Christian community.  Although the book does not take sides in the conflict, the stories clearly do.  (The book also has chapters on the Christians in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, but Israel and Palestine is the bulk of the book.)  I recommend this book for anyone who is interested learning about the people of Palestine (from the view point of a vanishing minority) and in the intransigent nature of the conflicts of the peoples living there.  
 i totally support this edition of modern magick and after having read some of the other reviews i felt compelled to provide you with some feedback. firstly before one can design their own spells, rituals or whatever it is you want to achieve being a magician you must learn from the masters before your time.  the techniques presented in modern magick exist today because they have been effective for powerful magicians for centuries (offcourse some ideas evolve over time) they are not just conjured up by man but passed down from one gifted magicians intuition to another "communicated from higher planes" if you are to disregard this then you have a long road before you can call yourself a magician. (its like trying to make a computer with no knowledge of technology, you have to study)  Also it takes discipline and study to become a magician  THERE IS NO QUICK FIX results come when you have earned them! once you have practiced the techniques in don's modern magick you will experience the beginning of what it means to be a magician, not just a dreamer. and this may be after several months depending on your capabilities. Iam glad knowledge isnt handed down on a silver platter as most people will practice the techniques given for a couple months then quit and this always weeds out the undeserving. if you persevere the fog will clear in time, you must be patient.  the ideas presented in moder magick are very clear and well understood, it can be one of those books that will actually speak to you if you work through it and commit to it. Don Craig seems to have played with the reader a bit as there are a couple of mistakes in the book and he will later emphasise to question everything you read and study in magick. This book is for the beginner/intermediate practitioner, this is obvious by the explanations eg- robe, alter construction etc.. so why make miastakes and insidiously blaim the reader later on? this is just a very minute criticism for an overall a must have in my collection, everything is just explained so damn well.   Enjoy ;) 
 Unique work that is overlooked.  All work has a very narrative-illustrative style. Srong line quality, color and composition.  For a viewer with the ability to explore 
 Made a great gift with the varied artist that has songs on it 
 Beautiful clear copy of an Easter classic. It is wonderful to see this film on DVD, there is a noticeable improvement from the video version. Unfortunately there are no special features besides languages and subtitles. Also comes in a plastic case which is an improvement from the cardboard cases Warner Bros. usually issues. I highly recommend this DVD for grownups and children alike. 
 hey my "real" name is Oscar and this CD is unbelievable! Andre reaches your minds and just makes you think about rap like never before.  his lyrics are hard and truth explaining.  if you're a true rap lover  you'll love his music.  remember lyrics first and then come the beats 
 Great things come in big packages with unassuming titles.  This is the best book I"ve read in years, and certainly ranks near the top all-time.  Right here on Amazon I've read reviews comparing Mahfouz to Joyce, Dostoyevsky, Flaubert and others of similarly acknowledged stature.  I didn't believe it before, but I do now.  Kamal, the youngest of the brothers in Mahfous' family, compares favorably to Stephen in Portrait of the Artist.   
 Enough people have generally explained the plot, so I will not. Suffice it to say this is Mischa's best movie, and perhaps the best of any actors early performance. Unfortunately, her subsequent major roles are hit-and-miss - "Skipped Parts" being a hit, and "Lost and Delirious" is to be avoided at all costs. Sam Rockwell was also excellent as "Trent", the friend of Mischa's character ("Devon").  Elsewhere I read the one negative review of this movie by someone who seemed upset over nudity and child pornography. The fact that Mischa is topless for a few seconds (and shot from across the street, at night, and about 2 inches tall on my TV) does not quite fit the category of child pornography, I do not think, unless you are predisposed that way and really, really hard up.  This is a story about a mis-matched friendship, and all the prejudices that attracts, plain and simple. Great dialog, too.  Also, ignore the DVD cover - it has nothing to do with the movie. Why the mother takes up half the cover is a mystery - she is a minor character. The picture of the shirtless man is, I think, from the photo of his high-diving award, and the image of Devon and Trent on the truck actually takes place on a river bank, not on a lawn. I suppose it is Hollywood's influence creeping in - fortunately it does not affect the movie.  
 This little CD is a mini gem that comprises all of the Joga singles into one EP, if you will.  There are 2 great mixes of Joga one is done by Howie B., the other is the Buzz Water mix.  They are minimalistic mixes and are a nice counterpoint to the menace at the end of the album.  The B-sides are of mixed quality.  Sod Off is excellent in parts, but is incredibly grating in others, the song is a puzzler.  So Broken is a guitar driven song that has Bjork go way off the handle with the vocals, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  Lastly, here comes Alec Empire.  The hardcore master comes and offers his services; basically the songs are Alec going into a self-indulgent rage of hardcore beauty.  If you started the song a minute in, there is no way you'd know it was a remix, but it doesn't matter. They're still pretty damn solid, and I like the way the vocals are worked into the remix.  Overall, if you're willing to pay an admittedly steep price, you should get your money's worth

 While the general job of anyone getting the "Music By" credit is to underscore the emotional context of the filmed image, electronic music is often overlooked as a tool by which this can be meaningfully achieved.  Indeed, most electronically-rendered scores ARE easily forgettable, and in some cases flatly inappropriate for the action being described.    But Gregson-William here chooses precisely the right instruments and displays his absolute studio-side mastery.  In part this is because the film itself, being so heavily involved with electronic surveillance, obviously calls for a more artificial musical score.  But his real genius is in finding a way to give both cultural context and recognizable motifs.  Whether the current action on the screen is set in Asia, Europe, America or the Middle East, the music feels like it belongs both in those locales AND in the same movie.  The main theme for Redford's character doubles as the SPY GAME theme, and it's worked and reworked throughout to give a thoroughly satisfying evolution through the action.  If you've been disappointed by electronic soundtracks in the past--and who living through the 80s wasn't?--this score will show you just how expressive the genre can be, when handled by the right artist 
 I saw this on some movie channel awhile back and fell in love. Every aspect of this movie is incredible, from characters, design, story, to the voice-overs, it was wonderful. It's definitely not your average giant robo/magic girl/samurai/demon/action/what have you-style anime. Instead it's a touching (almost believable, as far as anime goes) and engrossing film about a trio of hobos in search of an abandoned baby's parents on Christmas Eve. But there is so much more than that. Simply put, this is one of the few anime's to really touch my heart. Unless all you are into is Inuyasha style mediocrity, you must see this. A movie has never made me cry, yet this one came real close. I can't say exactly why, but I love this movie more than almost anything else I've ever seen. (even more than Spirited Away 
 The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth by Scott Hahn  Through the ages the book of Revelation has perplexed Biblical scholars and casual readers alike.  While admitting the difficulty of the challenge, Scott Hahn takes us through Revelation using both a spiritual and literal interpretation, and draws upon his experience as a Lutheran minister and convert to Catholicism.  His conclusion: Revelation is a virtual road map to the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.  Hahn's writing is clear, understandable, and persuasive.  In addition, he provides comprehensive notes that should appeal to serious students of the Bible.  I strongly recommend it for all readers 
 Wonderful musicianship.  Infectious rhythm.  I'm thankful to all the other reviews.  I never get tired of this one.  I would prefer the flute in unison with their outstanding fiddling. The band in general features its two fiddlers with good reason, but it would sound lacking to one who enjoys flute and fiddle in the florid melodic line.  A very strong band and very danceable.  The flute,where used,is very good 
 I have been an avid spacewolf fan since the beginning. This is a pretty good book with just a few inconsistencies like the dreadnought which changes weapons from one scene to the next. Its not a bad chapter in Ragnars life so I would recommend it if only because its about Ragnar.  Chris Hawke 
 Put together powerhouse talent like the brilliant Mary-Louise Parker, the hilarious Whoopi Goldberg, and the sweet Drew Barrymore, and you have "Boys On The Side": Cinema Gold.  This movie takes you along for an entertaining ride, and pulls at your hearstrings like an 18 wheeler at the end.  Two thumbs up 
 The footbed feels just a tad different than the original birkenstock, somehow it hugs your heel more, but still a most comfortable sandal.  The shape of the heel is also not the conventional birkenstock, it is very slightly angled out, hardly noticable, and still attractive.  For the price, any slight differences don't matter.  It is still an extremely high quality flat sandal that will mean happy feet and legs, and a happy back for years to come.  Highly recommended.  
 This is the first book on the subject matter that I have read.  I must say this book is a must for any novice investor.  The author sheds light on understanding why the online novice daytrader is not on a level playing field.  (Did you know 7 out of ten daytraders lose money?)Upon reading this book, you will understand why.  Currently, I have delayed further day-trading until I get access to a "more" level playing field.  For example, quicker connection's, perhaps not using an online brokerage firm.  Researching NASDAQ LEVEL II QUOTES!, understanding who,what,why,how the specialist, and money makers role is, researching software, and of course getting my hands on other books!! 
 I'm a novice seamstress. I bought this book, bought some fabric on eBay, bought some supplies at Ben Franklin, and sewed a slipcover and six zippered cushion covers for my 7' tuxedo style sofa. My slipcover is machine washable (fits in with my dog and kid lifestyle), stays firmly in place on my couch (unlike the ones you can buy cheaply) and looks pretty professional! I could not have done it without this book; I followed the directions line by line and it worked out great. If you have a sewing machine and can sew a straight line, give it a try. My next project is my wing chair and ottoman 
 I got this CD four years ago when it came out.  It was one of the first country CDs I bought actually.  I bought it after hearing "You'll Never Know", the most beautiful song on the album written by acclaimed songwriter Kim Richey.  Although the singles off this CD failed to win big at radio, that doesn't mean that the songs aren't great.  I still play this CD after four years!  It's an all time favorite.  If you bought her first CD "Ten Thousand Angels", you'll love this one.  You'll also love "I'm Not So Tough", her most current release.  The songs on this CD display various emotions and Mindy uses her voice  like an instrument.  "What If I Do" is a Mindy song with attitude, that same attitude that made "Guys Do It All The Time" a number one hit.  "Oh Romeo" is one of the best songs and it touches on the sensitive topic of teen suicide.  "Long, Long Time" is sung with amazing emotion, it's probably one of Mindy's all time best performances.  Mindy McCready is so underrated as an artist.  She deserves so much more credit than she gets.  Her voice is pure and clear.  Her songs are heart-felt and emotional.  Get this CD, you won't be disapointed.  Mindy is responsible for turning me into a country music fan 
 The subtitle, "the untold story," is intriguing.  Does it disclose some previously unknown facet of the company?  Or does the book fail to tell the whole story?  Take your pick.  The book combines aspects of an anecdotal biography with aspects of a promotional corporate history.  It begins with a biographical sketch of James Emmett Casey, who founded United Parcel Service as a teenager, delivering packages on a bicycle.  It is a real-life Horatio Alger story.  About halfway through, the book switches to a summary description of the present-day UPS.  Throughout the book, Jim Casey is used to personify the company and to serve as the glue that holds the story together.  The narrative moves with an uneven, sometimes fitful pace, often revisiting time periods that were covered earlier.  The story is told in a conversational style, often switching to the first person when the author includes his personal observations.  Originally, UPS was a package delivery company for department stores.  Over its first 50 years, it's operations spread from Seattle to the major cities on the west coast and the northeast U.S.  During the next 30 or more years, UPS changed its business from department store deliveries to an all-points service for any shipper at any location.  The present-day UPS operates on a global scale, using the very latest digital technology.  Throughout its 100-year life, UPS has maintained a hard-working, semi-military culture and has to a great extent achieved employee-ownership.  It is an interesting and informative story.  However, it does have its faults.  In its effort to make Jim Casey the personification of the company, the book gives short-shrift to the second generation of managers, particularly the ones who guided UPS out of the department store business and into the common carrier world.  Further, the book understates the importance of that shift; it is presented as merely following a lucrative opportunity.  The fact is that the department store delivery business was dying.  Had UPS not changed its operations, it is likely that it too would have gone out of business.  The book also understates the obstacles to that change.  Public service regulation existed, in part, to enforce government-established monopolies - and that enforcement included prohibiting companies like UPS from competing against the previously authorized carriers.  The primary opposition to UPS' change of business was not the Post Office, it was the existing authorized carriers: Railway Express, the bus companies and the film carriers.  Getting approval for nationwide rights in that era was viewed as impossible but the book does not even mention Preston W. Davis, the architect of UPS operating rights miracle.  Similarly, the book fails to mention two antitrust suits that could easily have nipped UPS' new business in the bud.  UPS won one of them and settled the other.  With its faults, this is still a worthwhile read. 
 The author repeatedly traveled to Afghanistan (as well as to other, adjacent nations) in the course of recording her impressions and tying them together in a story of the Afghani peoples and nation.  As with all best reportage of this sort, her narrative is constructed of direct observations, conversation, and interviews, both formal and informal.  The suffering of the Afghanis is as undeniable as it is appalling--but the strength of her narrative rests upon the history and details she effortlessly weaves together.  You can't read this book and remain unaffected, whatever your view about the current military conflict going on in that part of the world.  It is appropriate that Ms. Lamb won the highest award available from those who know her craft best, her fellow journalists.  She is a compassionate and honest human being; were it only the case we could say that of all, a story such as she tells would never have been formed.  
 This week I read Thomas Mullen's The Last Town on Earth which impressed me. OK, I loved it. Sure, it pushes some of my interest/fetish buttons (plague [the 1918 influeza epidemic], WWI, the Wobblies, war resistance, utopian communities, the Northwest U.S.) but it's a remarkable novel which, if it has a fault, it's that it tries to do too much. But, that worked out fine by me; I was avid for all its tangents. It's a different sort of read, highly recommended.  I can't wait to read more from Mullen's pen, er, keyboard.  I expect it's not polite to say:  Hurry Up 
 Dante stands alongside Shakespeare, Milton, & T.S Eliot et al. as one of the most profound minds and thinkers of our shared culture and history. Whilst the recording does not capture the tone and poetic sensibilities of Dante, It is tragic to say the least that anyone can publish a review - in particular those who can not even read (See Annie Feng's review). I think there is a need for some form of Quality Assurance to ensure that those who can appreciate art (regardless of their religious or philosophical stance) can read reviews that are of a genuine critical nature that understand something of the historical and literary context of a particular work rather than just bigoted condemnations !!! A good way of doing this would be to note the number of people who find a particular review helpful -     It is important to note that 0 out of 3 found Annie Fengs review of help !!! (good to see Annie gave the Angel DVD series 5 stars - i think this speaks for itself).    Could Annie and people like her please stick to the Angel series or at least learn to read - are u really over 13 years of age Annie ?? 
 I got one word... amazing. I'm a die hard fan of Ludacris. He is the real King of the Dirty South. His crazy flow and witty rhymes have no match, if you have gotten all of his CDs, you know what I'm talking about, he's unstoppable. You can't deny it. This album was one of the best for DTP. Better than the last one. Luda reps the dirty dirty and gives an awesome performance and so does the whole DTP Roster. These are some of the songs that stood out to me:  - "Georgia" - Classic, Ludacris, Field Mob and Jamm. did an awesome jod. They all flow amazingly  - "Put Yo Hands Up" - Upcoming group Norcflk is doing it big with this track.  - "Gettin Some" - Shawnna goes crazy. Beautiful  - "Thats My S***" - I like to call this one the lyrical bomb. Nothing but fast, clever rhymes from the roster.  - "Come and See Me" - Smoke and Stat Quoe flow really well here  - "Break A Ni*ga Off" - Lil' Fate gets his, with the help of Rich Boy and Gangsta Boo  ..... I could keep going.. you know that right. All of the tracks are incredible. Get the CD. DTP 4 Life!!! 
 Heidegger's multi-volume preoccupation with Nietzsche, despite its obvious and tremendous interpretive uncharitableness, is a monumental -- and, consequently, fruitful -- misreading the cultural-diagnostic and prophetic  power of which is certainly worthy of Nietzsche 
 A.A. Milne's early classic, WHEN WE WERE VERY YOUNG, reads like a literary fountain of youth.  It's a short little book aimed most likely at those who are not old enough to read and probably only barely old enough to be read to.  Yet fans of A.A. Milne (there are far more adult fans than young fans) as well as lovers of English verse will fall in love with this little book.  It contains 44 poems, all of which are fun and  simple.  The illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard provide wonderful compliments to each poem.  This is the perfect introduction to A.A. Milne 
 This landamrk film keeps of course the acidity of his bitter significance around the brutal conflict, aroused by inner rivalries between Ivan and the Boyars who were directly involved with the assasination of his parents.  A monumental masterpiece that must be seen by all those who love the cinema.   
 Offensive films is the definative scourse for info on the movies of Binema Vomitif.  The only book of its kind on these kinds of flicks, it is original in the fact that it doesn't just give a run down of the films, but a complete history of its making, the makers, and its impact on the genere in general.  For those who love these types of films for any reason. GREAT 
 Whether it's a re-interpretation of Bresson's "decisive moment" or his feeling of strangeness that Kert?sz's Chez Mondrian remained unpublished and unknown for so long; David Travis' seven essays make for an excellent afternoon's read and offers insight into some of the subtle nuances that comprise the gamut of photographic genius. In fact, I found his essay on Kert?sz more interesting for what it said about Mondrian than about Kert?sz himself although it does provide context for his meticulous compositions Chez Mondrian and Mondrian's Pipe and that the Mondrian studio environment may have "helped to discipline [Kert?sz's] lyrical eye."  I'm afraid I was less than convinced with the curious relationship of number theory to photographic composition. Particularly the statement attributed to Cantor that "...these two sets form the same size of infinite set.." (an absurdity without dimension) and I switched-off from the details at that point. I did however, enjoy his conjecture regarding the role of the subconscious in both mathematical and artistic creativity and the acknowledgement that inspiration and perspective is often found far away from the perceived comfort of our own artistic discipline. For me this is where the book's title made every sense and on reflection served as it most important lesson.  Travis' final three essays offer plausible conjecture into the generational stages of Weston, Stieglitz and Strand not only with regards to the chronology of creative expression as identified by the Japanese tea master Sen no Rikyu but also because there is much within the Rikyu aesthetic that speaks to their latter work. Well recommended!

This eliminates the finger !  This book is good not only for the "point-and-shoot" digital cameras, but also digital SLR.  This book 'shows' photos of Nikon and Canon high end digital cameras. But, don't let this discourage you.  I have a small Kodak 5 MP and I have been able to take some tips and use it with this "point-and-shoot" 
 I'm delighted that Mrs. Parker is still in print.  I have the old Viking Portable (a gift from a friend some years back), and needed to acquire a copy for a friend who had not read Dorothy Parker's works before.  I may need to purchase this edition for myself; I read part of the introduction, which is updated from the earlier edition.  The more time goes by, the more appreciation there appears to be for this amazing woman's intelligence and wit.  The ragged page edges are somewhat annoying, especially for a book like this that I, at least, like to thumb through, but I've seen this treatment in other books so it appears to be the latest fad in publishing circles.  I hope they get over it soon.  My favorite poems are Resume, Frustration, and Inventory.  The short story The Telephone is a timeless testament to impatience.  I have a visit with Mrs. Parker several times a year, just randomly flipping through the book to read stories, poems, and her reviews 
 I loved this book. It is a good light, funny read. It gives alot of insight in regards to current technology and lets you know what is out there in response to robot hardware/software. Some parts were flat out funny and other informative. I thought it was a great book for anyone interested in robots and technogoly and where we are going. I also loved the cover of it which is a shiny, glossy eye-catching cover. One I enjoyed 
 Against the stars a turtle passes...  And so begins another of Terry Pratchett's tales of the Unseen University,  a place where wizards go to study, kill each other, and, in their spare time, eat a lot.  This time Archchancellor Ridcully has a serious problem.  The Librarian has come down with magician's flu and with every sneeze the University's favorite orangutan changed into something else.  A carpet, a red-headed grimoire, aven a deck chair.  To make matters worse, the books in the library are in revolt.  Now the worst hangs in the offing, the only hope is to bring Rincewind, the Unseen University's most inept graduate back to pacify the library, which they try to cure the Librarian.  Only no one is quite positive where Rincewind is.  After all, only an hour ago, no one ever wanted to see him again.  Rumor has it that Rincewind was dumped on the continent of Fourecks, a place where most people consider rain an offensive legend, after his last misadventure.  The magician's primary talent is surviving disasters only to find himself in worse trouble.  With this information, the faculty of the Unseen University troops into the office of The Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography and, by virtue of peering through a window that shouldn't be there find themselves precisely where they shouldn't be - in Fourecks, but a few thousand years too soon.  While Rincewind tries to avoid murder, torture, and irritated citizens  on modern Fourecks, which has run out of water, the Archchancellor and his companions discover themselves present for the continent's creation by a God who was, well..., a little bit too thorough.  And the Librarian is still sneezing.  And somewhere, the many-footed luggage struggles to find its master.  In many ways, The Last Continent is a tour de force.  One long, hysterical mockery of pompous academics, time paradoxes, science gone absurd, and the temerity of radical deities.  One can't help but admire a man who really believes that humans exist because nature abhors a vacuum and that taking things seriously is a sure way to wind up taking orders from a very pushy kangaroo.  Even Death stops in for a moment to see what Rincewind is up to.  One can't help but applaud 
 I am writing to say how entertaining this new book features such Latin superstars like Vikki Carr, Gloria Estafan, and Selena.  It is time we salute such great woman, and special thanks to Grammy superstar Vikki Carr for making Latin music popular here in the US.  No one has done more to promote the culture in the US marketplace!  I am very proud to see that the website that Vito Cifaldi and Daniel Maglione maintain, www.VikkiCarr.net is credited in this new book as well., and finally get credit for all their work.   Vikki, there's no other site that has brought so many of us fans together, we know you are proud of them and the world is proud of you!  Everyone needs to stand and give Sylvia a standing ovation for giving us such an entertaining book to read.  Thanks Sylvia  Gregory LA 
 This was a fun to. My 2 year old sis triend it and she got as high as my head. BYE THIS 
 After reading the book "Leadership on Lincoln," I wanted to learn more about the life of this fascinating figure in American history.  This title provides many details about the man, his many tragedies and failures, and his ultimate success as a leader.  The author does well in not standing in the way of his subject -- he simply unfolds the story before the reader's eyes.  This volume is rather large at 600 pages, but the read is an enjoyable one.  For anyone wanting to discover a thorough treatment of the life of Abraham Lincoln, this book is an excellent investment 
 In this film, Jean-Louis Trintignant is a conflicted double agent caught between the old Italalian Fascists and his new left-wing bosses.  I had forgotten how good an actor Trintignant is.  This is available in the original Italian but I also watched the english dubbed version and it is fine.  The direction by Bernardo Bertolucci is excellent.  His framing of the scenes bould not be improved upon.          
 I thought the story was real and had very positive meanings.  Some of my favorite actors and actresses are in this movie; their acting skills added beauty to the story.  I enjoyed the film, the history and  life lessons.  **** 
 Dr. Seuss's second book was a childhood staple of mine. If one believes in the destiny of early influences then this book might just be responsible for my entry into the hat business. This great, lesser known Suess story, addresses the fact that the hat has historically served to establish the individual's rank in society and that relationship to the origins of hat etiquitte. 
 This contains the best of Chandler, if not all of it is the best of Chandler.  "Red Wind" is one of the most brilliant short stories not just in detective literature but in American Literature.  The last few paragraphs are unspeakably precious, and give more insight into Marlowe's character than any of the novels.  And the rest of the stories are fine too 
 I may not always agree with Amy Goodman's tactics, but one has to admire her journalistic enthusiasm.  She goes where the stories are, regardless of danger, backlash or criticism.  I found her book very informative, mainly as an expose on the "integrity" of the media, from which most Americans get their news.  For instance, I never thought to question the journalistic independence of the "embedded" reporters in the Iraq war, but you have to wonder how impartial they are when they are a part of a military unit.  While journalism integrity was the main focus of the book, another important theme was corruption of politicians.  Goodman provides many good stories and evidence of corruption and scandal, which always makes for good reading material.  The Jessica Lynch story was one of my favorites, since I never realized that the story was mostly fraudulent, propaganda spoon fed us by the Pentagon.  Overall, this is a very interesting and quick read and recommended to all viewers of mainstream media 
 I would actually rate this 4.5 and Understanding Comics 5.0.  First the bad, there is a common use of McCloud's eye symbol, representing "comics," and it at first is bothersome, distracting, and somewhat annoying.  Also, some panels seem out of place, or just filler maybe to create a sense of hype at that right page's corner, or maybe he just got caught into tangents.  Regardless, at times, I feel drawn out and tired. Despite this, your efforts are rewarded as he seems too have comics right on the ball, except for some of the over lofty goals.  Some have complained that the drawing itself is not as aesthetic since it was done with computers, which contradicts the content.  To understand this better, one must remember Understanding Comics (This is a series after all... it is easier to understand the new after understanding the old).  In it, as I recall, McCloud says that there are certain ways an artist can create certain effects--in other words, an author can make something easier or harder to read.  Reinventing Comics is simply harder to read than Understanding Comics in part because McCloud in this very book tries to reinvent comics.  It's a heavy load and is upon further inspection quite impressive.  He also draws attention to where it needs to be drawn.  He seems to keep asking for a "Duchamp" to arrive in comics, and some seem to think he refers to himself, but again, incorrect.  He never states he is this person and in fact gives a lot of credit to future generations for being able to "pop the bubble" so to speak.  He is simply trying his best on executing his own theories.  Scott today is perhaps my favorite comic book writer because of the heat caused from his ever intelligent observations.  Because of his series, a revolution could come much quicker 
 Mr Butcher's _Harry Dresden_ books are like popcorn.  You can't put it down and you can't get enough.  See my review for the first one 
 When this novel first appeared in 1966 man had not yet walked on the moon and HAL (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) had not yet appeared on the big screen, so the ideas of permanent lunar colonies and self aware computers were quite revolutionary.  And Heinlein, being Heinlein, did not stop the shocking ideas there.  In Heinlein's universe the Earth has become a unified planet, more or less at peace and with a shortage of food and an excess of population.  A partial solution to both problems has been to empty jails by transporting criminals, including 'subversies' and juvenile deliquents to the moon for the duration of their sentences.  Unfortunately for those transported it is a one way trip since after a few months in the lower lunar gravity they are physically unable to return to Earth.  As the story opens this plan has been in effect for three or four generations, leaving the moon with a majority of it's population who had never been convicted of any crime or who had long ago completed their sentences.  These free 'loonies' were trapped on the moon, forced to either work for the 'Authority' directly or attempt to carve out a living independently but only able to do business with the Authority.  Crops grown could only be sold to the Authority at low  fixed prices and goods imported from Earth were purchased at high fixed prices.  In addition the loonies had to purchase air, water and other services, again at fixed prices, from the Authority.  It was a situation ripe for revolution, lacking only an inspired leader.    The leader appeared in the most unlikely form.  Third generation loonie Manuel O'Kelly-Davis was sent to repair the Authority's mainframe computer  and discovered that the recent computer glitches were a result of the newly self aware computer trying out his sense of humor.  Mannie and computer, now named 'Mycroft Holmes', agree to keep this development between the two of them for the time being at least.  On the way home Mannie is coerced into attending a political rally by a friend, and the beautiful young woman with him.  At the meeting Mannie finds himself in the midst of a revolution and on the run.  As the revolution proceeds Mannie finds himself, and Mycroft more and more involved.  As always with Heinlein's novels the stories managed to slip in details that question all those things the reader 'knows' is true.  A machine can't be alive - can it?  A prison colony cannot overthrow the entire Earth - can it?  A marriage is only between one man and one woman - isn't it?  For fans of RAH's work it is interesting to note that 'Grandma Hazel Stone' of THE ROLLING STONES appears here as a scrawny 12 year old street kid.  RAH's ideas of group marriages are described here, concepts that will be further explored in many of his later novels.  While excellent, THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS is not without flaws.  Mannie's dialect is a bit difficult to get used to and makes for slow reading at least at first.  Some of the radical aspects of the novel have lost their shock value over the years, besides self aware computers and lunar colonization, the 21st century reader is not surprised by interracial marriages.  RAH's views concerning women have mellowed in this novel from his very conventional sexist ideas of his early works but are still quite  old fashioned by today's standards.  This is a definite must read for any fans of RAH and would be a good place for anyone unfamiliar with his works to begin.  
 Great anthology, althouh if you want to stay true to it you should get both cd's, they are both amazing.  Paco's blessed hands are hard at work in this compilation from previous albums, a great way to start a de Lucia collection.  Make sure you get LUZIA and SIROCO  too! 
 This book was a concise and short fable on management that was to the point, enjoyable, and provided much usable information.  
 The DNA evidence on the likelihood of Aryan migration into ancient India shows that the linguistic and archaeological evidence Bryant painstakingly wasted his time surveying is unreliable. After all this huffing and puffing and resort to academic credentials to buttress arguments one wonders about the methodology of these subjects and credibility. Please read the: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of United States of America   S. Sahoo et al., 'A prehistory of Indian Y chromosomes: Evaluating demic diffusion scenarios', PNAS, January 24, 2006, Vol. 103 no. 4 843848 
 My copy of this book is so tattered!  I teach poetry at the elementary level and have used this book over and over again with kids from Kindergarten through 6th grade.  It's clear, accessible, adaptable and has produced fantastic results every time I use a lesson -- priceless 
 This is, without a doubt, one the BEST gardening & landscaping how-to books on the market.  Easy to find topics, including:  The Basics, Flowers, Food Gardens, Lawn & Groundcovers, Trees and Shrubs, Houseplants and  Container Gardens and much more!  Hundreds of easy to follow illustrations!   This book is PACKED with useful tips, directions and wonderful projects! A  HIGHLY recommended book 
 I remember when I was little when saw The lion king in theatres and was amazed at watching the animals and the Disney part of it. Now that I'm 18 however It is now an even greater film to me because of what's contained in this story of father and son love, revenge, tyranny, friendship, childhood romance, and ultimately all out war. Lately I was able to get my hands on the new platinum edition that was put back in the Disney vault some time ago and it is just beautiful. This movie I've always thought was awesome as a kid, but now that I'm older I feel it is a work of art and genius from the makers of Disney of how they were able to make the main character Simba into a type of Hamlet figure and chief villian Scar into a lion version of Adolf Hitler. I have word to the parents and thats to let your kids watch this film. They will forever remember the awesome and entertaining chracters such as: Simba, Mufasa, Timon, Pumba, rafiki, and above remember the deceivingly evil Scar and his army of hyenas.  This is simply put my favorite Disney movie.  
 This is the Bible of self-help books. I've actually read it a couple of times and I'm sure I'll read it a few more. There is no other book that has benefited me more both personally and professionally. If you can only read one book, you can't go wrong with this one.   -- Nick McCormick, Author, Lead Well and Prosper 
 To the other reviewer's point, there is a reason that this collection features the "same old shows" that have been kicking around for years, etc. If you read the Encylopedia of Old-Time Radio, you'll see that tapes of the other shows have not been found to date -- the only ones out there are from the later Hollywood shows, not the New York shows with the original cast. Rumors have circulated for years that the tapes are being hoarded somewhere ... but at any rate, these are the ones that are available, until more are discovered 
 I was in my 20's when I first heard House On Pooh Corner....my kids loved the song as they grew up, and we're now sharing it with their kids.  A great CD for all ages... 
 My Funny Valentine is an excellent collection of standards.  The vocals are stunning.  Give a listen - should be on any music lovers shelf 
 It is hard to find one book that provides a full survey on the various stategic approaches, but this one does a fine job of presenting the approaches it addresses.  It is written in a manner that allows those with limited understanding of business to grasp the concepts.  I would have liked to have seen a broader coverage.  
 While I am a fan of many of Steven Halpern's work, this one is my personal favorite.I never hear the end of this CD if I play it when I'm tired or before bed. Like the title says, this music truly brings you to higher ground. It enhances and deepens meditation, and is a wonderful accompaniment to massage 
 If, like me, you find the study of New Testament textual criticism somewhat less than thrilling, you might enjoy this new study by Professor Larry Hurtado.  Prof. Hurtado focuses on a neglected aspect of New Testament studies: the ancient manuscripts as artifacts.  This involves a number of features, such as the physical form of the manuscript (the codex, the roll, and opisthograph), corrections and mistakes in copying, words that were emphasized in certain ways, and the location of the manuscript. These "artifactual" features of the texts give insight into the early Christian movement.  While it doesn't appear that more intense study of early Christian manuscripts will lead to any bombshells for the study of Christian origins, Prof. Hurtado's findings and conclusions are interesting.  Consider the question of gnosticism.  The "Gnostic" Christians didn't make extensive use of John's Gospel.  In fact, it was more popular among the "orthodox" Christians.  In addition, it doesn't appear that any apocryphal Gospel texts were physically attached to the canonical Gospels.    A study of the ancient texts raises a number of questions as well.  For example, most ancient manuscripts from the time of the NT texts are in roll form, however the early Christians preferred the codex (the precursor to our books) for reasons that remain unclear.  In addition, the number of manuscripts of certain NT works - such as Hebrews, and Revelation - is quite interesting in light of later controversies that developed surrounding them.  I saw surprised to learn that there are more copies of the Shepherd of Hermas than almost any NT book.  Prof. Hurtado provides an interesting case study of the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas.  Although any conclusions are preliminary given that only three manuscripts are extant, a study of them tends to indicate that it wasn't viewed as scripture (at least by those groups connected to the manuscripts). 
 I bought these for my husband, and althought they looked great he tends to have a wider foot, the shoes didn't fit well. the fit is more the long and narrow foot, which, personally, I think is an adidas product trait. I'm a big fan of adidas. Should have gotten a wide, but I thought it was worth a shot. Hopefully this helps someone. I thought it worth mentioning 
 My bookshelves used to bend, groaning with the weight of computer manuals and books, collected over the years.  In a cathartic fit, I recently cleaned up this surplus, winnowing away to just the few books I consider invaluable, or such nostalgic classics that I cannot part with them.  And I swore an oath never to collect books that didn't fit these criteria.  Having read Version Control with Subversion, I'm happy to report that this hallowed shelf will be getting a new addition.  I found this book thorough, clear, concise, thoughtful, and above all, useful.  If you plan on using Subversion, get this book.  Soon.  If you know a bit about how this book was written, the quality of this book might come as no surprise.  The book's content comes from the same source and process as the software it documents: an open encounter between the authors and the users of Subversion.  From the Preface: "...the book was written in the public eye, as a part of Subversion." Ben Collins-Sussman, one of the authors of Subversion, responded to repeatedly fielding the same questions from Subversion users by drafting "The Subversion Handbook."  This "FAQ" was then used as the basis of the book, and the results speak for themselves.  I found the book extremely pragmatic, but more than merely a pedantic tutorial.  It transcends the "How To" genre by providing not only concrete tools and examples, but also through examining the critical question of "Why?".  This sensitivity sets it apart and makes it a invaluable aid, by exposing the philosophical rationales of the authors.  It has helped me to understand not only how to use the software well, but to understand the software itself.  I have been using source control since the very first days of my professional involvement in IT.  It has saved my bacon on occasions too many to count (without embarrassment).  I have staunchly advocated CVS, which has been the stalwart source code control tool in the UNIX world for years.  However, as most any user of CVS will attest, the old girl has a few warts, and has begun to show her age.  The authors of Subversion aimed to create a successor to CVS, "by creating an open-source system with a design (and look and feel) similar to CVS, and by attempting to fix most of CVS's noticeable flaws."  I think Subversion succeeds in this regard, and I have found this book an excellent guide to making the transition from CVS to Subversion.  The book addresses the full gamut of topics I had interest in, and quite a few that I suspect I'll never have need of.  Covered topics include the history of Subversion, its features, and installation methods.  For those new to tools like CVS and Subversion, there is a clear, thoughtful and useful guide to basic concepts of version control. Those more familiar with version control will find quick gratification in detailed coverage of a typical daily work cycle.  The more advanced topics of branching, merging and tagging are given relentless and cogent treatment.  Typical of the book's thoughtful and deep exposition, the chapter on branching includes a section entitled "Best Practices for Merging".  This consistent beyond-the-how-to treatment moves the book from the "read it, learn it, give the book to someone else" category into a reference that I know I will return to often.  The structure, features and administration of a Subversion repository are covered in a chapter of their own.  The topic of running a Subversion server is examined in similar fashion, including a clear exploration of the trade-offs between running a standalone Subversion server, or running it under Apache.  The book includes detailed documentation of the Subversion internals, for those wishing to use Subversion as part of a tool they develop.  A complete command reference rounds out the main section of the book, and is followed by several appendices. Of these, I found Appendix A, "Subversion for CVS Users", especially useful.  Finally, I think the hallmark of any truly excellent technical documentation is a deep, detailed index.  Version Control with Subversion doesn't disappoint on this score.  I just wish all computer books were this good 
 Capably and collaboratively edited by Mauro Bertani and Allesandro Fontana, "Society Must Be Defended" is a collection of French philosopher and historian Michel Foucault's eleven lectures given at the College de France from 1975 to 1976, and which are ably translated into English for an American readership by David Macey. Offering an unusually insightful perspective and wisdom on a wide variety of educational topics ranging from the origin of feudalism, to the functions and domains of racism, to Hobbes' ideas on war and sovereignty, and a great deal more, "Society Must Be Defended" is a very thought-provoking and instructive collection from a uniquely informed and informative point of view. As Michel Foucault writes about this compilation of his views: "The role of history will, then, be to show that laws deceive, that kings wear masks, that power creates illusions, and that historians tell lies. This will not, then, be a history of continuity, but a history of deciphering, the detection of the secret, the outwitting of the ruse, and the reappropriation of a knowledge that has been distorted or buried. It will decipher a truth that has been sealed" 
 I like that The Bark ISN'T a monthly magazine. I usually get sick of a magazine after a while. When another one comes, reading it just seems like something to add to my "to-do" list.   But I'm always happy to see the beautifully photographed cover of The Bark when it arrives. I've subscribed for several years and have seen it go from something that could barely be called a magazine to its current slick and fabulous format. 
 Every DVD Pranamaya produces is first class, in-depth yoga education. Paul's Anatomy DVD is no exception. It is absolutely sensational. "Anatomy for Yoga" has many great ways of showing the skeleton and how it works, including wonderful 3-D images and videos. Plus, Paul has tremendous wisdom of the body and a graceful way of explaining complex material. Every yoga teacher and serious student should have this DVD. I rate it a 6 on a scale of 1 to 5 
 I began reading Neverwhere simply because I had already read two other books by Neil Gaiman and liked them (Anansi Boys and American Gods), so decided to try his work for a third time. And I'm very glad I did. Neverwhere is a great story: well written, believable characters, and a very good storyline with many good twists and turns in the plot. Before reading this book, Anansi Boys was my favorite Neil Gaiman book, but Neverwhere just might end up beating it to be on my list of favorites. Both stories are somewhat similar in that the main character is a shy, unassuming, and mild nice guy who has so far always been pushed around in life because of it. But then the world he lives in changes into something very strange, and he has to change with it, becoming a stronger, more assertive hero. It definitely reminds me of a dark, comedic horror-ish, modernized Alice in Wonderland tale, or your own pseudo-nightmarish dream.  To be fair, there were two things I didn't really like about the novel, but they are both minor quibbles with the plot itself. I can't say too much without giving away spoilers, so I'll just suffice it to say they both involved the Big Bad Guy, but thankfully these quibbles didn't detract from the enjoyment of the story. They were just little flaws of reason and logic in the plot, in my opinion. Otherwise, a very good plot.  And to wrap up, there were many points in the novel where I found myself thinking of it in terms of a big screen movie. The visualizations, dialog, and pace of the story all lent itself well to a movie adaptation, in my opinion. And I just discovered that it sort of had been: The BBC made a miniseries out of Neverwhere back in 2003, however from what I've read about it, it was very low-budget, kind of hokey, and probably not done nearly as well as it really deserved. The DVD of this BBC miniseries can be bought on Amazon, and I plan on getting it soon to see for myself. I do hope Neil Gaiman can get this novel re-done as a movie or miniseries, though.  Gift Idea: Like Anansi Boys, I think this book would be a great gift to some teenager or young adult who likes deep, intelligent novels 
 The first time I became acquainted with Wally Lamb, I read "She's Come Undone" for an English Lit Course. Like many other's I adored the book, but was hesitant when I picked up "I Know This Much is True" for two reasons. First, it seems like nowadays that truly incredible books are hard to find. So what are the chances of finding two by the same writer? Secondly, the sheer length of the book (at just under 1000 pages) can be a little intimidating at first glance. And given my previous experiences with lengthy modern novels, I was ready for a big let down once again.   Yet, I was pleasantly surprised to find one of the best books I've read, EVER. Wally Lamb does such a great job when tackling seemingly controversial topics that most writers wouldn't dream of touching. Having worked with kids suffering from behavioral/mental disorders I was impressed by his potrayal of not only the effect of schizophrenia on the individual, but also the effect on the people surrounded by that individual. Granted he adds your occasional plot twist to add to the "story" (twins, flashbacks, ex-wives) he still manages to hit the nail on the head. Both Dominick and Thomas are so well rounded that you FEEL the angst and pain of every treacherous turn in the battle that both fight against Thomas's disease.  The novel evokes every human emotion possible and by the end you may find yourself smiling (or frowning) through the tears. I know I love a book that can make this happen and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something absolutely incredible. And even better yet, despite the length of the book I couldn't put it down. By far it's one of the easiest 900 page reads I've ever picked up.  My only complaint, that the book had to come to an end.  
 While my dad worked in a steel mill in western Pa. this is my story too. It is the story of growing up, Catholic, in the 60's & 70's in a small town. The Lost in Space chapter is fun, since I collect LIS toys now.The  author was shooting higher than this, but it hit me emotionally at a lower  level. I enjoyed the book, and have re-read it many times 
 I have come away from this book with a profoundly different perspective on life.  We are all meaning making machines.  Most of us are not aware of all the meanings that we are creating and this book gets into the nitty-gritty of it with great detail.  I found the author's formula of a Meaning; "External Behavior = Internal State" or "External Behavior causes Internal State" to be utterly mind blowing.  For those reading who have no idea what this is, here is an example.  We see or hear something (this is the External Behavior) and we make that external behavior equal or lead to some idea or feeling (the Internal State).  "Your being late makes me sick" is a meaning where "Your being late" is External Behavior and " makes me sick" is Internal State.   The premise of this book is that when we create meanings for ourselves, they create the frame of reference for how we see the world.  Those who experience a lot of pain growing up create meanings (or frames) that have them see the world as a scary place even if there is no danger in the moment, while those who experience mostly joy growing up create meanings (or frames) that have them see the world as a safe place.  How we frame the external events creates our experience of those events.  This book is about examining the meanings you have created (your frames) and re-working the ones that do not serve you.  This can be a lot of work as I found myself often having to re-read pages over and over to see where it applies in my life and how I can use this.  But doing the work provides a BIG payoff of feeling lighter and more in control of your experience and the experience of others 
 well the articles are much better then they are in Maxim. These people have some sophistication. The women are a lot of naked and that is great plus they are increddibly hot. Most of them are from Europe which is awesome any way. I really don't know why I gave it 4 stars because nothing holds it from a 5 sta 
 To discover the unique beauty and history of the Outer Banks, David Stick is THE author to read.  His lovely blend of history and legend, written in great style, is the perfect book to learn about the lighthouses, people (and horses!) of the Banks 
 We have a high efficiency washer so we use half a cap of this product and our wash comes out great.  I also love the fragrance free of the free clear.  This is my 2nd purchace of 9 bottles 
 This is a true story and it is a very sad one in the history of the west and of the church.  Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson	and many more take us through the history of slavers in South America. Irons, who plays a Spanish Jesuit Priest, goes into the wilderness to build a mission, to convert the Indians. DeNiro plays a slaver who eventually joins Irons' mission and serves the native peoples.    The main question in this film is that of ownership, and the right to make slaves. The mission begins in Spanish territory that is sold to the Portuguese. The Portuguese do not want to accept that the natives are humans - but at best trained monkeys - and that their Christianity does not protect them from becoming slaves. The Cardinal who came to oversee the decision came with a decision already made, and his inner turmoil, as the narrator, draws the viewer into the political side of the decision and the political side of the church's role in the decision, at that time, in a way that few other films ever have.  The film is a cinematographic masterpiece. While watching the movie, pay close attention to light and darkness, the music, and the angles used in filming. This movie is great and a must see because of the story it tells and the way it tells it. It is truly a film and not just a movie.  
 Essential for anyone interested in 20th century prose.  Complements the holes in language the novels & plays sought to expose.  Beckett knew everything there is to know about form.  These shorts move between poetry and prose.  See especially the series "First Love", "The Expelled", "The Calmative", "The End"- the bridge from Watt to Molloy. The blackened page of Beckett's paragraph-less mummur is not for everyone, but once you hear his rhythm, it is not easily forgotten 
 This is simply one of the most stupendous travelogues I have ever read.  In fact, I can't think of a better one.  Read it 
 This book is a sure thing for anyone who is looking for the root of their eating problems. This book explores the reason why we eat and the habits we need to change in order to succeed in defeating those habits. With the help of this book I have lost 30 pounds. It is amazing when you do some real soul searching and read EVERY PAGE of this book what determination you will find in yourself!! Dr. Phil is right on!! 
 I've read this book at least once a year every year since 1989 when it was first recommended to me by some college friends.  Started my quest to read all of PKD's works.    "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, it doesn't go away."  That quote alone makes the whole trip worthwhile 
 Buy this little fun toy clock. It's a blast in the bedroom, just look up and you know the time. I Love it!  Cute little thing.  The front panel is worthless (to see) but who needs it 
 this is a fantastic read.  gives alot of detail of annikin's early training with the jedi and his first steps towards the dark side.  if you like starwars pick this one up and read it 
 This is an impressive collection of 60+ articles on teaching and learning.  Don't be confused by the title, it isn't just for sociology, it can help all teachers in college or university.  There is also a CD included that has 70+ other articles and resources you can use.  It should help me as I write my own articles but also as I design new courses and revamp old ones.  I'm glad it was recommended to me at the last teaching workshop I attended. A bit pricey but if you take teaching scholarship seriously, it may be well worth the investment 
 .......Laying on your back in a field of crayola-green grass, staring at the clouds and noticing the river and mountains behind it, and feeling the ground spinning beneath you, then getting up and walking down a path through the woods that, you soon notice, has golden writing on it, and then you see one of your best friends and shes smiling and you're smiling (zonked!) and so you and her and your other friends pile into the car and leave the park........and then you're driving and a record is playing and the trees are flying by and so are houses.. 
 Following John's advice I tried countless times to get my iMac G5 to read the disk, but no luck. There's more than one way around it, though. I loaded the disk onto my ancient G3 iBook which recognized it immediately. Using a 1GB thumb drive I copied the songs and carried them back to my iMac. Using the iTunes "add to library" command (rather than "import"), I soon had all the songs in iTunes.   The disk is great, but this shouldn't be so difficult, hence one star off for the trouble. 
 I find it really difficult to write a review about this particular record, actually to write a review about any album by six organs of admittance. that is because this album works in a very non-verbal way. it does not create any clear thoughts in me while i listen to it. instead, it is very meditative and transcendent, it speaks directly to me in a very profound way. i find this record to be very calm and quiet but also incredibly intense at the same time, and it never forces anything. this music has about the same effect on me as buddhist mantras and chants do, but i find it even better.   the music itself is consisted of acoustic guitar and drones. there are very few pieces that are lyrical on the record. the compositions themselves are brilliant and they make a brilliant whole. the record works as one piece perfectly for me.  i wouldn't compare this music to devendra banhart, vetiver or any other new acoustic outfit, nor would i compare it to any droney "post-rock" bands. comparisons are generally just something silly and irrational, something that doesn't exist, but for the purpose of trying to describe this undescribable and unique music i'd say it sounds like mixture of forementioned buddhist chants, droney music like coil's time machines and brilliant acoustic guitar.  six organs's music is unique and true, honest, without any pose, music that is concentrated on substance, not image, and i would recommend it to people who honestly strive to be that way.. 
 I love these things!  Within 2 to 4 days after placing these into my aquarium, most of the bulbs had started growing roots.  After planting in the gravel as instructed, they began sprouting leaves.  There were different plant varieties in my package.  They grow very fast and look great.  I use a fluorescent bulb on a timer for 9 hours/day 
 I went out and got TrimSpa X32 yesterday, and so far I am very pleased. In the past, I have use other weight loss supplements and TrimSpa X32 as well. I haven't used any for quite a while and when I started yesterday, I was quickly reminded how well TrimSpa X32 had worked in the past. I took the first 2 tablets, and if you are sensitive to supplements I suggest taking 1 to start until you know how you feel. I had half of a chocolate milk for breakfast as that was all I could fit in my stomach. When lunch rolled around I ordered chicken fingers and halfway through them I was stuffed to a point where I had felt I had thanksgiving dinner. (This is why I suggest starting with 1 pill) By the time dinner rolled around I was so pleased with my day. I finished my chicken fingers and had low fat chips. Each time I ate, I felt I could only eat so much. I counted my calories and realized that this product is going to be a huge help. Counting calories and exercise is very important, there is no miracle pill, but I am happy so far with the assistance that I received from TrimSpa X32 
 big leggs tight skirt is a great jam.i dig the tracks with Carlos Santana,Bonnie Raitt but the duet with Van Morrison was hitting the best.a true Legend who still makes his Guitar rock.a solid disc 
 This movie should be placed among the timeless World War Two classics such as Schindler's List and Life Is Beautiful. It is truly one of Williams best performances since Goodwill Hunting. It acurately portrays the life of people during the Jewish Holocaust. Iwas touched deeply by this movie and moved by the great performance of Williams and the rest of the cast. Peter Kassovitz establishes himself as a great director with this movie. The book was great and the movie was even better 
 I began with the abridged version, then listened to the rest on free listings.  This musical gives you the story in not only detail but atmoshpere.  The songs are heartbreaking, uplifting, terrifying, inspiring, everything the novel was and more.  Having read Hugo's long masterpiece is not a pre-requisite to enjoying this fine piece of music, though it does give the listener a feeling of having shared an inside joke 
 Finally -- a Christmas album that doesn't include "Jingle Bells," "Joy to the World" or "Let It Snow." Instead, Loreena McKennitt looks back on an almost-forgotten time when Christmas was a sacred holy day, in the all-too-brief but very lovely EP "A Winter Garden."  It opens with the soothing, lullaby-like "Coventry Carol," before heading to the majestic catchiness of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" and utterly enchanting "Good King Wenceslas," where a saintly king and his servant travel on foot to bring food and firewood to a poor woodsman's family. It's a beautiful little song, and the sprightly tune makes it even more so.  A smoother, softer tone comes in with "Snow," the musical adaptation of a poem by nineteenth-century Canadian poet Archibald Lampman. It's a frosty, beautiful portrait of a winter evening, without any direct reference to Christmas, but its formal tone fits in. The EP rounds off with the traditional "Seeds of Love," a sweet little love song.  Christmas is one of those holidays swamped by commercial profit and not by the traditions and beliefs behind it. So it's refreshing to hear songs that don't bring to mind mall muzak -- instead, McKennitt's EP make you think of wassail, medieval castles, cathedrals draped in holly, and blankets of snow over dark forests.  "A Winter Garden" was recorded over a few days in the summer of 1995, in Wiltshire's recording studios. It sounds pretty laid-back, and the relaxed tone of the results shows it. Her selection of songs is excellent -- four are traditional ballads, rich and underused by most singers. I'm not quite sure why she included "Seeds of Love," which while a lovely song, has no reference to Christmas or wintertime.  McKennitt not only provides her rich vocals, but also plays the harp and adds some keyboard flourishes. Backing her is Rich Lazar's medieval-sounding percussion, Hugh Marsh's violin and Caroline Lavelle's cello -- among others. There are also acoustic guitars, bass, viola, and pipes, which all are woven into a sort of medieval-pop.   While a full-length Christmas album can be found in "To Drive the Cold Winter Away," the "Winter Garden" EP is an enchanting, atmospheric listen that gives a whole new look at Christmas carols 
 I've been working for years to develop what Silverstein and Fiske describe as New Luxury products.  I wish I had this book in 1999 when I started!  While I have come to the same conclusions and I find that this book validates my concept and strategy like no other, the real value for me has been the better organization of the concept and suggested processes than I've been able to develop on my own.  When you read the acknowledgments you'll see a huge list of people and resources that few of us entrepreneurs have available.  This gives the book incredible depth and value.   Unfortunately the authors never mention ethnographic research although they are doing that science in an ad hoc way.  They may not be aware of the applicability of ethnology to market and product research.  Sure, ethnology was developed for studying remote tribes but mix this with neuroscience and environmental behavior research and business gets interesting.  A major feature of this book that we rarely see in biz books is the chapter at the end that explains their sources in a more useful way than the typical end notes.  It would be nice if more authors would explain their sources and reasonings rather than just list sources.  - ji 
 As a pet care columnist and behavior consultant, I've fielded my share of similar purr-snickety questions. After co-authoring two "Chicken Soup" pet books with Dr. Marty Becker, I'm jealous that my friend Gina Spadafori had the fun this time around. And I only hope my answers offer as much insight and entertainment as my colleagues' in this delightful "uncensored" cat-alogue of all-things feline! While some questions may seem tongue-in-furry-cheek, and the answers tickle feline funnybones, the bottom line means more edu-tainment for cat-loving readers. And that's just plain good medicine for kitty-cats and the humans who love them. Bravo!  Amy D. Shojai, CABC, pet care columnist, founder of the Cat Writers Association, and author of 20+ books including PETiQuette: Solving Behavior Problems in Your Multipet Household 
 I have given this work 4 stars, tho' 3.5 stars is more like it.  I do agree with the other review that it is slow going in some parts.  I think perhaps this may be due to the fact that the work was translated from the French.  But the work is significant in that a lot material that I had never read before about Jacques de Molay was brought to light.  If you are interested in the Knights Templar and the final chapter of the old military order, then this is an important read. Prior to this book the descriptions of the last Grand Master were cursory at best.  De Molay is revealed in this work to be a more capable administrator than previously thought.  In all the previous books about the Templars I have read de Molay was often referred to as gung-ho warrior type with little talents beyond the military aspects of the Order.  However, Demurger shows that this was not the case 
 I've been a fan of Yes for many years, so when I found this CD and it said that Jon Anderson was on it, I adopted it immediately, figuring that it was worth the few bucks just for his contributions.  Well, lo and behold - the entire CD is fantastic!  Every song is well crafted and the guests were perfect for each one.  The piece that's attributed to Jim Morrison is actually recordings of his poetry put to music, which is great.  The native american artists are wonderful also.  If you can't find anything on this CD to be happy about, then there's definately something wrong with your ears!  The two songs that Jon Anderson sings remind me of his days with ABWH.  I also found the bit that Martin and Charlie Sheen speak to be beautiful.  I finally found a great buy in the cut-out bin!  
 Seems Panasonic has finally dropped the hammer on the pseudo DSLR market, with 420mm at 12x or 749mm - 21.4x at 3mp is outstanding especially with OIS. excellent pictures out of the box, menu operations are plentiful, NR can be reduced and the jog dials front and back for Aperture or shutter is very professional.  Leica lens is crisp and sharp, I shoot in Aperture priority with NR at minimal and the pictures even in Jpeg look like they have been post processed, simply amazing.  After experiencing this camera I sold my Nikon D80, attachment lens and soft pictures Nikon was giving me is unacceptable, i went thru every menu option including using the much hyped RGB3 which by the way gives cartoon colors has no comparison to the Panasonic.  High speed USB is my only complaint for data transfers, Noise reduction for higher ISO noise is a bit over powering but acceptable but controllable at your liking, a 3" ,screen would be nice but maybe on the next model.  BTW, moon shots with the Raynox 2020 at 3mp give a zoom of 47.08x optical or 1647 mm optical, hand held shots with OIS (image stabilization) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures, you actually have a telescope with OIS at your reach, simply amazing.  100% satisfied.   
 I adored this book.  The character development is strong, and delightful! With the exception of the villain, all characters are likeable.  I couldn't wait to read the next book in the trilogy 
 Although I don't own a copy of this book, I've read most of it.  Just as the title says, this book focuses on one of the most important aspects of animation: timing.  It's well written and full of exercises and techniques that will help you improve your timing.  I've heard that some animation  schools use it as a textbook.  If you're thinking about a career in the  animation industry, this book is a must buy.  However, it's pretty hard to  find since it's out of print.  I think that it's worth the extra effort to  own a copy 
 In life, one of the big questions you have to answer is "What am I going to do when I grow up?"  To help you wrestle with the concept of what God has planned for you in terms of ministry and vocation, let me suggest an excellent book entitled The Call: Finding and Fulfilling the Central Purpose of Your Life.   Author Os Guinness explores the concept that God has a calling for each and every Christian - a purpose for your life, something that will enlist and enthrall you, even captivate you!  For most of you, your job will not be your calling; for some, it will be.  But what's the difference, you ask - read The Call to find out!  The concept of a calling has been misunderstood and misapplied for centuries.  Guinness even classifies the common misconceptions as the Catholic myth and the Protestant myth.  But the idea remains important, even central, to every Christian's life and there is no time more critical to explore and answer the age old question about meaning and purpose in life than before you chart a course for your life in the waters of your career.  Guinness writes, "[C]alling is not what it is commonly thought to be.  It has to be dug out from under the rubble of ignorance and confusion.  And uncomfortably it often flies in the face of our human inclinations.  But no idea short of God's call can ground and fulfill the truest human desire for purpose and fulfillment."  While the underlying concept of this book may appear to parallel Rick Warren's immensely popular The Purpose Driven Life, the similarity really ends there.  Guinness' The Call is not an "easy read" and is written at the college level, in terms of vocabulary and depth of insight.  This book is worth its weight in gold and your time to read.  Dostoyevski wrote that "The secret of man's being is not only to live, but to live for something definite."  My prayer is that you find that purpose to which God has called you to and prepared you for - The Call will be an invaluable resource in that journey. 
 Rory Stewart's account of his walk (literally) from Herat to Kabul is amazing.  The fact that anyone would do it is amazing by itself.  But he also drew wonderful pictures of different people and things he saw along the way.  I knew Afghanistan was backwards, but considering all the talk of globalization and Americanization, it's amazing to see a place where the people are still living as they must have centuries ago.  He gives us amazing (even scattalogical) details of his walk.  If you're interested in this part of the world I highly recommend this book to you 
 Great for beginners! If you are new to french consider this purchase. Easy to read and understand 
 This was a well done performance for Scott O'Dell.  It was mysterious and kept you wondering what will happen next.  You also grow fond of Ramon as you read more and more about his journey.  I can't see why anyone would not like it.  I encourage you to read the book (it's not that long) especially if you want to get away from the common "dragon slayer stories" that fill the book shelves today.  The Black Pearl is a good book to read if you want to take your mind into another world of beauty and mystery all tied up in one.   
 The author suggests "one-liners" such as "May I be awake in this moment - just as it is" which I find myself repeating throughout the day.  This has really made a difference in the way I see things.  I think everyone will find something helpful in this book.  Well-written in easy-to-understand terms 
 I read that book in French (Le Testament Franais) so it may be possible that the English translation isn't as good as the French one.  I found that book so wonderful and the progression of the boy from childhood to adulthood is so well described.  The images that Makine creates are beautiful and you can clearly see them.  It's an excellent book for the ones who like to think and to dream 
 I really love Bones.  It has everything: suspense, drama, humor, pretty people, fun storylines.  I have yet to miss an episode, and even into Season 2 this is probably my favorite.  It adds depth to all of the characters.  Also, the winter holidays are my favorite time of year.  I like holidays that are about what is good in the world.  Bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day.  I cry through half this episode, but in a completely good way.  Buy, watch it, love it.  But watch it with a friend if you don't want to cry alone.  So moving, great performances by the whole cast.  Emily Deschanel was powerful in this one, she brings real vulnerability to Brennan here.  David Boreanaz, as always the perfect sympathetic hero, loveably old-fashioned. Cute, funny moments.  Touching, poignant moments.  This really is the best of what is great about Bones 
 I like a good horror film, and this is among the best. I just watched it again for the umpteenth time this Halloween (yesterday) and found it to be just as enjoyable this time around. The energy that went into this project is evident, its sincerity genuine. What makes this movie so good is a great combination of many factors: the music is compelling and unforgettable; the cinematography is quite good while remaining unobtrusive, and the suspense is sustained from the opening frames to the closing. Although filmed in California, the film perfectly captures the flavor of Halloween and fall in the Midwest: leaves, having fallen from the trees, blowing around in the wind; cicadas and crickets singing, providing a nightly chorus, and the traditions of Halloween, including the ubiquitous pumpkins, popcorn and horror movie marathons. Haddonfield is every town in the Midwest and its residents quite typical. The feel of this setting makes the film seem familiar and plausible. Apparently quite comfortable in the realms of both teenagers and adults, John Carpenter melds the two worlds seamlessly. Too many horror films, or films of any other genre, for that matter, cannot seem to get this correct. The adults are typically treated like the enemy or too dense to catch on. Teens are normally reduced to caricatures, all hormones and no sense. The treatment of the "good guys" isn't the only aspect of this movie that distinguishes it from the rest of the lot, however. Michael Myers is a legend in the town and his story is well known among the locals. For him to come home does not seem possible because that would mean breaking down the wall that separates reality from myth. Yet, he is a real person (or character, that is), not an imaginary Boogie Man. After Michael kills one of his victims, he stands with head cocked, staring at him. The camera holds this for a few seconds, allowing us to contemplate just what is going through his mind. Prior to this point, we have only heard Dr. Loomis' resolute claims that Michael is somehow subhuman. Now we witness his confusion and bewilderment, much as a dog cocks its head and stares at a small animal it has just killed. Does he not realize the nature of what he has done or the finality as the result of his actions? Is he wondering who this person is? Is he wondering why the man has stopped moving? In this moment, we are voyeurs, catching a glimpse of Michael Myers alone, not stalking, terrorizing or killing. We don't have a victim's reaction to inveigle us, only a maniac's attempt to comprehend the world around him. Perhaps it sounds as though I am making too much of this movie. To someone who yearns for a well-made horror film he can appreciate, a film like "Halloween" matters substantially.   
 The telephone rang, and she knew she was going to die.  Talk about a line to draw a reader into a story! And it did pull me into the first chapter.  Then I paused. What, he's making drug-scum into heroes and heroines? I didn't really want to go on. Yet, I couldn't resist the appeal of Perez-Reverte's prose. I'm glad I didn't. Because "The Queen of the South" is another winner by an author I'm really beginning to like.  "Queen" is a look into the sordid world of drug smugglers on two continents and, despite my distaste for the real thing, it's an engrossing romp. As I did, you may not find Teresa Mendoza appealing at first. But, she'll grow on you as you watch her grow from a teenaged narco's morra into a sophisticated woman worthy of her own corrido as she and her faithful bodyguard Pote facedown their enemies alone.  Perez-Reverte even throws in a surprise late in the book, which puts another light on his hero and heroine. But, I can't get into that without spoiling the story for others.  The author employs a technique in which the tale is told in alternate chapters by Teresa and an anonymous reporter, a method which adds a sense of reality to the tale. 
 this is a great cd and it arrived in a very timely manner I am very happy with the service I have recieved through amazon 
 this is a great book for serious women athlete 
 The Assassination of JFK - Warren Report, NY Times Edition  The `Prologue' by Tom Wicker says the shooting took place at "12:30 PM Central standard time" (p.v). NO, it happened 12:30 PM Eastern standard time (lunch hour). The rest of the `Prologue' summarizes the events of November 22, 1963 that forever marks that day. The `Introduction' attempts to provide an overall look at the events and the theories of the Warren Report critics. Harrison Salisbury mentions the attacks on other presidents (pp.xxi-xxii). The pattern differs for JFK; a rifle was used to let the assassin escape after the shots were fired. A pistol was used by the assassins who did not care if they were caught. Distant observers may have a more objective view (pp.xxiv-xxv). Salisbury never asks if the stories about Oswald (p.xxix) make him an agent provocateur, like Czolgosz (p.xxviii).  Anthony Lewis reports the assassination was the work of one man; there was no conspiracy (p.xxxi). Lewis says they traced Oswald's purchase of the gun (p.xxxv) but never admits there were no records of any purchase of ammunition for this foreign rifle. James Reston admits "this report may not satisfy the historians" (p.xxxviii). The filmed events of that day provide records for future studies. No one person could process all that information until time had passed, and this explains the Anti-Warren Reports. The section with photographs are between pages 344 and 345; many are too small to see the details. What is the purpose of showing the back of a camera? After Oswald was rubbed out there was talk of a court of inquiry in Texas, or a grand jury investigation in Dallas. Instead the extralegal Warren Commission preempted them with a Presidential Commission that could only produce a report, never an indictment (p.5). Their conclusion was the story from the beginning: a lone gunman who was a misfit. Yet Oswald was married with children unlike Booth, Guiteau, or Czolgosz. His spotty employment record was not unusual for a young man who moved around.  The `Contents' on page 11 contain an index to the topics contained in this book. Page 182 says the telescope was sighted for a moving target just like the President's car. Coincidence or planning? The `Statements of Oswald' on pages 167-169 show either a compulsive liar or someone telling a cover story. Years later a Voice Stress Analyzer test of Oswald's tape recorded statements indicated he was telling the truth, or was insane ("The Assassination Tapes" by George O'Toole). The spurious identification cards showed skill at retouching negatives (p.527). What camera was used for this? Where would Oswald get a large-format camera?  There was a cover photograph on `LIFE' magazine after the assassination. It showed what looked like Oswald at the front door when the first shot was fired - a perfect alibi. We were told then that it was a look-alike. Decades later David Wrone wrote his book "The Zapruder Film". It has a photograph of that look-alike who was wearing a different shirt at the time. Wrone says two people were taking movies across from the Book Depository. Their films do not show Oswald of anybody else at the 6th floor southeast corner of the building. This refutes the Warren Report. If you've never heard of this its because of media censorship. After the reports of frontal shots J. Edgar Hoover claimed JFK was shot when he was heading towards the building. When the photographs were released showing JFK was leaving that building a new theory was created for the "lone gunman" solution.  [This is from the 1964 hardcover edition. 
 As a professional singer and Voice Teacher, I am so thrilled to see how American Idol has given the art of singing such a jump start in these last few years. These American Idol CDs and programs are filled with so much varying talents. From Hard rock to Country, America is becoming interested in identifying true talent. As an Opera Singer myself I can still enjoy the gifts of other genres and am sad to hear when others look down upon the show. Also, as a voice teacher of many styles I can't stress enough the need to my own students for them to develop themselves as a "Complete Unique Package". Finding their own true niche and style including: voice type, genre, best repertoire, to the the right audition outfit. American Idol teaches the same theories. Be true to yourself and your voice to get your best shot at this business of singing. I am an advocat for AI and all shows that encourage the high developement of arts in America. We come from a society that watched sports religiously on telievision (which is great) but there are so many talents to support including singing out there amongst us. American Idol gives artists and viewers a fantastic opportunity 
 Overall it is a simply designed and effective product.  I am happy with it and would make the purchase again if doing it over.  The only issue I have is that it doesn't heat perfectly even, but this is more of a food aesthetic issue than a food quality issue.  It's wonderful to make more than one pancake or french toast at a time, and great for Okonomi-Yaki 
 The Gift is a riveting, very well-acted movie about a woman named Annie (Blanchett) who still has not yet gotten over the death of her husband and struggles to raise her 3 young sons. She gets money from social security as well as supplements her income by doing psychic readings for many people in the town. One of her clients (Swank, who you can always count on for a remarkable performance) has an abusive husband (Reeves, fantastic as a wifebeater redneck here) who thinks what Annie does is witchcraft and he threatens her life as well as the lives of her children if she is to read for his wife ever again. Then, the daughter (Holmes) of an important man goes missing. She's engaged to a man named Wayne who works at the school where Annie's boys go (I believe he is the principal, but I could be mistaken...sorry, but in any event, played by Greg Kinnear). But there is much more than meets this eye in this gripping tale, and soon the police, with no clues as to where the daughter is, turn to Annie and her powerful gift to see if it can lead them in the right direction.   I won't spoil the rest of it for those that have not seen The Gift. Look for an amazing Giovanni Ribisi in the substory as well...he's terrific here. If you enjoy thrillers and are intrigued by the plot, The Gift is something you will surely treasure as I have. Even if you question the validity of psychic readings, this is a very interesting movie that's best viewed with an open mind. Very recommended 
 I learnt a lot from and was infinitely moved by Paula Huntley's  journal of the eight months she and he husband spent working in post-war Kosova.  Understated, beautiful writing and none of the straining for effect that mars so many memoirs.  She was clearly writing straight from the heart.  I rarely do this but as soon as I finished the book, I found her website and donated something to the scolarship fund for young Albanian Kosovars.  A fascinating and inspiring story of some very resilient people 
 The perfect size...It will hold a 12oz. can of beer plus foam or a can of Pepsi plus four large cubes of ice (and the ice won't melt much).  Looks beautiful on the side shelf of the BBQ grill, it won't blow over, and stuff stays cold even in direct sunlight.  Now if I could just get 'em to put my name on the side...Hmmm, It's still perfect in spite of that 
 This 1962 Columbia cast album of Show Boat is pretty good all around.  With a handpicked cast of some of the biggest musical stars of the time, Goddard Lieberson couldn't go wrong.  John Raitt as Ravenal, Barbara Cook as Magnolia, and William Warfield (from the 1951 MGM film) as Joe.  All the rest of the cast are great as well.  This was the most complete cast recording of Show Boat when first released in 1962 and was up until McGlinn's set was released.  The only reason this album gets only 4 stars is that the bright and brassy orchestrations are such that all the songs begin to sound alike after awhile.  Other than that, not many gripes.  Highly recommended 
 this item is great.... i love it...i have my 35 mm and digital camera in it along with everything else i need.. 
 Mr. Thacker does everyone a service with his well orgainzed and written treatise on the often confusing admission process. Job well done Mr. Thacker, keep up the good work! A must read for anyone who is applying to college or whose kids are applying for college. Do yourself a huge favor and pick up a copy of this book now 
 This film was also shown on Lifetime Television as The Familiar Stranger 
 As usual, very compelling writing, and glimmerings of his playfulness with language that would become more developed in Lolita.  Also, many similar themes as in Lolita:  an older man takes a younger girl as a mistress, becomes obsessed with her, is jealous when a rival lover comes along.  Also similar:  long car trips and a pistol that ends the story.  Overall, a hard book to put down, if just because of the writing style, but the story itself does not seem new.  A sort of dadaistic film-noire meets Henry Miller 
 David Hoffeditz is a highly skilled writer who examines various single biblical characters greatly used by God.  In his book, They Were Single Too, I appreciated David's thorough examination of the texts of Scripture and his vulnerability in describing various facets of the single life.  His timely humor and deep thought-provoking challenges encouraged me to view life as a single woman in an innovative way.  I wish I would have had this book as a resource years ago!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who seeks to understand God's perspective on the topic of singleness.  As a graduate school professor and licensed professional clinical counselor, I see GREAT benefit in utilizing this book as a resource.  This book is a "must have" for individuals, groups, churches, and academic institutions.  I have yet to come across any other book that addresses singleness in such a creative way.  I have read the book once and am already reading through it a second time because of the great encouragement I received from its content.  I am looking forward to reading more of David Hoffeditz' books in the near future! 
 Martin Scorsese is purely and simply a genius!! Now that's a title that people use too loosely these  days, but in his case, it's just the plain truth! Down through the years he has given us some of the greatest  cinematic moments on film with some of the best actors  in modern history! 2006's "The Departed" is by no means a  variance from the script~! Like "Goodfellas", "Casino", etc., it's an instant classic  with an ensemble of the hollywood elite!  All of the actors play their parts with laser precision for  the maximum emotional effect!--Brilliant!!  Jack Nicholson shines as the menacing & maniacal villian! Leo DiCaprio gives another stellar performance! Mark Wahlberg is a real tough Boston cop in this who has a gift for antagonization! Martin Sheen gives a subtle but powerful performance! Alec Baldwin is a hot-head and impatient...what a stretch! Matt Damon gives an intense performance as the weasely, two-faced, double-dealing cop who provides some of the movie's most diabolical plot twists and gets it in the end!  I could on on and on, but like I said everyone was just great!  I would just love to see Scorsese direct one more mega-gangster  epic with De Niro, Pacino, Pesci, Palminterri, Travolta,  Gandolofini & Imperioli before he passes away!  Now that would be my all-time dream team for a gangster picture  set in the 50's in New York City during the  Albert Anastasia / Gambino period! Oh, but one can only dream, right 
 This book gently explains to young children the reality and inevitability of death. I enjoy reading this book as much as my daughter enjoys hearing it 
 Thank you so much, the book was just as described and shipped direct fast! 
 One of Kathleen Turner's earlier films and one of Anthony Perkins's later films....and one of those films of its day.  A woman leads a double life as a designer by day and hooker by night. What's she escaping from? The former high school quarterback turned security "expert" and husband - what's he escaping from? And the reverend - what's he about. Watch the film to find out.  This is the film which demonstrated what a great actress Turner is and why she should still be a bigger star today than perhaps she is. She has such a wonderful voice and figure in this film - it's as if the part was written especially for her; perhaps it was! It also shows you how good Perkins was in a role where he could let himself go as over the top as Russell would like him to. He (Perkins) must have loved it.  OK, there are one or two sex scenes and there's some swearing, but the acting by the two leads is excellent. Annie Potts is also very good, as she always is - very different from her Ghostbusters role - but Laughlin is a bit of a disappointment. I wondered whether he was right for the role.  The musical score is supposedly written by Rick Wakeman, but is, of course, derived from Dvorak's New World Symphony. Wakeman does a great job and the music adds to the gloss of the film. The saxophone playing in the lovemaking scene is sensual in the extreme.  Ken Russell is not known for doing things in halves - and he hasn't here. If you can stand the commentary of him and the screenwriter over the film, you can get their thoughts as the movie plays - very insightful and a boon for budding Directors - and find out why he did scenes the way he did.  So, a great film and still very watchable today 
 Walker's collection of essays is innovative but mainstream Renaissance  scholarship, aimed not at settling biographical arguments about Elizabeth's  life (in fact the books many distinguished essayists accept what virtually  all historians believe about Elizabeth I--even the open-minded doubt that  she was stupid enough to risk real intercourse with a lover) but at showing  that not everybody in Tudor England worshipped her uncritically. Some,  implicitly or--when it was safe--explicitly had criticisms to make and  could wish for a different monarch. What I admire about this book, aside  from the fascinating evidence that its writers adduce, much of which will  come as news even to Renaissance scholars, is the cleverness of Walker's  basic idea (a refreshing change from the usual "cult of  Elizabeth"). It matters that not everybody thought Elizabeth a fairy  queen, a Gloriana, a new Diana. Tudor politics and culture were complex,  and Walker's team of writers can show this. I especially recommend the  Tudor picture of Elizabeth as a giant ruffed bird. Ugh! So buy this book:  it is clever, informative, often amusing, is based on meticulus  scholarship, and has that wonderful bird. As the editor of a Renaissance  journal (Spenser Studies), a member of the board of the Renaissance Society  of America, and the author of two books, one edition, and two anthologies  all dealing with the Renaissance I do know what I'm talking about. This is  a fine collection. I give it four stars--reserving five for the Bible and  Shakespeare 
 ...A popular, intermediate-level effort- It's definitely *great* for memory drawing, and it's recommended *mainly* for this reason...  In recent decades there have been 3 main teachers in learning to draw heads from memory. For cube-based construction we have George Bridgman. For ball/sphere-based construction we have Andrew Loomis. And for oval/ellipse-based construction, we have the famous teacher of the Dynamic Drawing series- comicbook artist Burne Hogarth. Many of today's Japanese animation & comicbook instructionals are using these very same principles, along with some of the teachings by the Famous Artists School. My current interest is in oval & cube-based construction, and it's exclusively *oval-based* construction that is emphasized in this book. For me, the *best* section in this book is the 2nd of its 6 sections- which is oval-construction simplified. It's just 21 pages out this book's 160- but it's actually worth getting if you're interested in drawing from memory. The rest of the book, in my opinion, is mainly filler- to justify an entire book on this subject. In fact, Burne Hogarth's 1st book, Dynamic Anatomy, gives us a *very* brief intro into this exact same oval-based construction, and I think many people will prefer getting Dynamic Anatomy for this reason. I highly recommend getting the *original* version of Dynamic Anatomy- since I'm not a fan of the new, 'revised and expanded' version available today.  Really, the *main* sections in this book that seem interesting to me are that 2nd, 5th, and maybe 6th sections. In the 5th, many different head-types are depicted and compared, including about 30 specific ethnicities- giving this book a somewhat 'international' feel. The 6th section is a 'gallery' of heads as shown in ancient sculpture, as well as more modern western art. It's interesting information overall; just not really necessary in learning to draw heads from memory. In short: For *beginners*, I highly recommend Drawing the Head and Figure by Jack Hamm in addition to this. For everyone else, this book is *moderately* recommended. P.S. For photo-reference of different ethnicities, check out Facial Expressions: A Visual Reference For Artists; also here on Amazon 
 I'll start off by saying EBM/Industrial is my absolute favorite genre of music. Growing up with artists like David Bowie, Genesis, Sting and the Police, Tom Petty and AC/DC, i have a very broad taste for music, but nothing moves me like ebm/industrial does. This latest recording by Tom Shear is one of the finest recordings i have heard in a long time. "Opened" is a great way to start the cd - it kicks you into high-gear, and prepairs you for the sonic onslaught that is to follow. The next 8 tracks are the quality of music that i've come to expect from him. Heavy beats, complex synth layers and moving, intense vocals and lyrics. The real shinning track on this disk has to be "Lullaby" though. Slower than all the rest, mellow and melodic, the lyrics are full of care and compassion, and will soothe almost anyone. Again, Shear proves he is a powerful force in his genre, not to be overlooked. If you're a fan of "smart" music, check this out. You won't be disapointed 
   As the Author of this book describes in a chapter the facts of blackness: Had I read that right?...He asks himself.    And this is what I feel of this whole read. Have we read this right?  I am yet to read a comment or review that discusses the heat of controversy which this book involves.  I am yet to read something here, which covers the mind of this author.  Highlights the spirit and intensity of this book.  Hello! Am I the only one puzzled by lines such as this: "In no way should I derive myself to the revival of an unjustly unrecognised Negro civilisation.  I will not make myself the man of any past." (226) Is this the kind of statements which empower coloured social movements of today?    In the intro of this book he poses the question "what does the man want?...what does the black man want?"  He asks this question to himself and his directed reader about his coloured friends.  If this question was about us then do we agree that this is or was the question of colour today?.. If so then how does the Author answer it in our case?  How the author chooses to investigate the case of what he says is the "colour prejudice" stem mainly from methods devised from the medical profession. That is to say he comes to his conclusions by psycho-analysis.  He also includes personal observation and experiences from the attitudes of the people in his home soil Martinique.  From this he presents to us archives from philosophical and literate giants of French culture.  He questions them.   He questions them as I believe he would have us question them and even him on certain statements he makes.  He questions them, opens their claims and challenges it on their ground of understanding.  It is then understandable to see how he got a particular giant of literature to preface his forthcoming book "wretched of the earth" through his bold spirit of inquiry. If there are some tones of a manifesto in this book I believe it would be derived from lines such as these:  I am working... towards a new humanism... colour prejudice... mankind I believe in you... (p9) And I believe these are the goals the "coloured" and "wretched" of today should be commenting on and responding to.     Here are some of the question I would advise one who has not read this book:       1: Did we get what the black man wanted?  How?  (pg 9)    2: Do we recognise what he means when he speaks of going      beyond himself for a universal cause? What is this universal human cause to be exact?      3:And most importantly who is this book directed at?  (pg9)    If this book does not leave you with more questions than answers then either the times are `illin (never better, cool) or you are.   
 Nietzsche and Wagner were adept at picking on their contemporaries in a way that is so thoroughly unpopular now that I would not be surprised if this book is never again printed with the Introduction by J.P. Stern which  was in the 1983 version reprinted in 1989, and which I purchased in 1990.   It is clear from that introduction that David Strauss had read the first  portion of this book and furnished his friend Rapp with a clear question  about Nietzsche's character in a letter of 19 December 1873.  "First  they draw and quarter you, then they hang you.  The only thing I find  interesting about the fellow is the psychological point -- how can one get  into such a rage with a person whose path one has never crossed, in brief,  the real motive of this passionate hatred."  (p. xiv)  Those who are  familiar with legal procedures, or how the media treats anyone who is  suddenly perceived to be a fink, might enjoy this book as something that  might be considered an unforgivable outburst today.  Who could wish for  such a  triumph now, over intellectual paths which crossed twice?  When  Nietzsche was young, he perceived a scholar who displayed the real  Straussian genius.  Later, Nietzsche could only find a writer who, "if  he is not to slip back into the Hegelian mud, is condemned to live out his  life on the barren and perilous quicksands of newspaper style."  (p.  54)  I could have rated this book a bit higher, for being much more  truthful than is expected of scholarly work today, but the kind of scholars  who read these books might have no idea what I meant, or they know that  they are better off not raising questions about those political issues  which are most questionable.  Nietzsche's real fearlessness began here 
 The book brings together the seminal essays which help define and locate  Subaltern Studies within contemporary academic debates.  It is a good  introduction to postcolonial studies, historical methodology, marxism and  global history.  This book is an important resource for those studying the  historiography of the subject by providing key texts from both the  Subaltern theorists and their critics.  Of key importance is the book ends  with the most comprehensive bibliography on Subaltern Studies which will be  of great value to those scholars interested in pursuing further research in  this and related disciplines.  Overall, this book is not only an  exceptional resource for scholars within the field, but also provides other  readers with a great introduction to the field 
 For a person that originally started out in the early days of the English Art Rock scene, Robert Wyatt has come a long way.  Still remaining something of a cult figure, for his uniquely English style of Canterbury scene music, that Incorporated elements of Post-Psychedelic, mixed with Improvisational rock-rhythms and highly articulate songwriting, coupled with a quaint retro-whimsy, that not only referenced a subsequent form of 'Instrumental Jazz', but also linked art-rock and psychedilia skillfully together.  He has remained on the musical fringes commercially, but remained critically acclaimed, even if that acclaim hasn't translated into mainstream sales, happily churning out albums that immensely pleased critics, and his fanbase.  But It wasn't really until 2003's exceptional "Cuckooland" (and a subsequent 'Mercury Music' prize nomination), that people are starting to catch wind of this guys remarkable talents.  "Sea Song" is the most gorgeous of songs, initially a sad sounding song, it has the willfully detached & melancholic tones, of singer-songwriter derived music, but the droning synths and delicate keyboard & harmonised vocals feel more like left-field ballads, are thoroughly steeped in a decidedly sombre tone, with Robert plaintive lyrics: "You look different, every time. you come.... From the foam-crested brine, Your skin shining softly in the moonlight,  Partly fish, partly porpoise, partly baby sperm whale..... Am I yours? Are you mine to play with?", coupled with the quirky nautical theme.  A song that is as, slight and lyrically searching, as it is wonderfully sad, funny, and very, very strange.  It redefines what the accepted notion of what 'Pop' music should be.   Second track "A Last Straw", is more subdued, Nocturnal, intimate & reflective.  The downtemp bass & ringing Hi-Hat open the beginning of this track, before Wyatt's high-pitched voices bursts forth with: "Seaweed tangled in our home from home, Reminds me of your rocky bottom, Please don't wait for the paperweight....Err on the good side".  The sound is one of an Jazz-improvisational feel coupled with jazz-tinged piano chords, mixed with the warm sounds, and atmospheric drums, that are more in line with the cerebral and hypnotic relaxed mood of electronica.  Curiously...Wyatt, begins to use his voice as a atmospheric instrument, adding 'Wah-Wah' sounds over the lush arrangements, that although proves to be slightly disconcerting at first, although after a few listens it begins to feel as integral as the music being played, before the track then begins to drift out, with a simple, lightly subtle ethereal background of piano composition.  "Little Red Riding Hood Hit the Road", features huge trumpet and Saxophone arrangements, with a decidedly 'Afro-centric' percussive drum beat layered underneath the warm soothing synths.  Think a more improvisational unstructured Jazz, with a nice helping of swirling psychedelia, mixed with a weird turntable 'spin-back' effect, that seems to be simultaneously distorting the sound &  Wyatt's voice, over which he textures the sound with vocal 'Hums' & 'Ahhs', before choosing to sing some 3 minutes into the track, one of the strongest tracks, held together by the strangest of ideas.  Track 4 "Alifib" leans towards, the eerie detached, reflective electro-synth, that feels like the evocative, mournful, sample-laden downtempo sounds of electronic outfit "Boards of Canada", that starts this track, with delicately plucked guitar shuffling quietly in the background.  Wyatt lets the track slowly build momentum, and along with the melancholy synth, is arguably inventive and builds on the abundance of ideas throughout the album, and although the unusual sounds, may disorientated new listeners, they demand several listens to fully appriceate.  "Alife" uses a crackily sound distortion, with a odd off-kilter tabla-esque percussion and gloomy piano, a decidedly downcast saxophone, that punctuate the sound with wild Sax flourishes broaden the sound.  Wyatt sounds like he's having a theatrical conversation with someone (or indeed himself??), whilst the instrumentation gathers pace, with drums gaining in tempo, whilst the Sax shrieks, with the unrestrained fury of the 'Free-Jazz' that someone like the legendary 'John Coltrane' so vigorously championed.  It will at this point become a little clearer to most, that with each song, Wyatt is pushing the level of experimentation on each successive song, moving from more accepted Pop-conventions, into a more left-field Progressive Art-rock sound and becoming more increasingly psychedelic, that have some listeners (like myself) applauding his genre experimentation and attempts to offer a varied suite of songs that although broadly based in conventional genres (Pop / Rock ), are fused and intergrated with other genres to thrilling effect: (Jazz / Art-Rock / Progressive / Psychedelia).  "Little Red Robin Hood Hit the Road", is possibly closer in overall sound and composition to "Sea Song", with more jaunty feel....but a driving and militaristic Drum beat pounds over the top, with a stunning electric style Guitar, that immediately evokes comparisons to 'Pink Floyd' , with a uniform tone, ranging from the pastoral, but swiftly making the excursion into more lilting 'Space-rock' rhythms, mixed with gentle Violin, that isn't usually applied in these sorts of tracks, yet remains frequently intriguing, feeling like an appealingly mannered, very English form of psychedelia, before the track takes a complete U-turn and morphs in a distinctly theatrical dance production based on the idea of a cosmic and rustic theme.  The transition into theatrical music, will surprise many, and I myself had to check to see, if it was indeed a hidden track that had started playing, as it seems a slightly strange choice to finish the album on, but theres no denying that The melancholy strings and plaintive piano are beautiful, and feels like an underrated orchestral epic.  Giving this album 5 Stars, hasn't been a difficult decision, as Wyatt has a sound that is uniquely his, and his ideas and styles are so varied that, it's an album that has enough ideas to double the 6 tracks that make up this album.  It's a album that'll certainly blur (or indeed Change) your preceptions of what can be accomplished within Popular music, and even though his music isn't something associated with retail performance, he is most definitely deserving of the critical praise heaped upon him.  But the harder decision to make is who to recommend this album to???  Newcomers would (as it pains me to say it) , be probably better served with a 'Best of' (try his : 'Greatest Misses' album for starters), as it's a easier introduction to his music, as the decidedly quaint and English eccentricities that are littered throughout this album, may cause first timers to wonder, 'What all the fuss was about?', but those that are familiar with his work: fans or otherwise (I downloaded a couple of tracks....loved it, and then bought the album), are advised to add this exceptional gem to their collections immediately 
 Just fininshing up a history term paper here for my major, and I thought I'd drop off a good word for the best secondary source on Sappho's life and work that I've ever seen.  Ms. Williamson leaves no rock unturned, no  aspect of Sappho's work or life unaddressed, and manages to do it in an  entertaining and comprehensive way without running  into 500 pages!  If you  are interested in Sappho at all beyond the text of her extant poetry, this  is the book to buy 
 Strong family fractures over a son/sibling killed in combat find their way to mending with a Christmas visitor with more than human ties to the son/sibling.  Provocative, inspiring, emotional 
 I am over thirty, and I found this book too cute. But when I read it to my 6 year old daughter I was surprised by how much she liked it. There is only one book she likes better - Astrid Lindgren's Mio, My Son. Now we are on the third or fourth rereading. It seems to be the perfect book to read before putting a child to bed 
 This is a terrific workout for those who are getting started and who may want a short workout to keep her metabolism going.  The workouts get the heart pumping without strain or shortness of breath. This DVD is wonderful.  Also it is terrific for walking indoors when walking outdoors isn't possible.    Denise Austin is encouraging and pleasant.  I find her workouts and I have done many (Fat burning Yoga, Yoga Buns, Pilates, Kickboxing Etc) stimulating and encouraging.  The only criticism I have is that she doesn't include women or men in the videos who are "weight challenged"  All those shone with her are very fit, slim people.  
 I bought "Leap and the Lost Dinosaur" for my kindergartner and he absolutely LOVES it. His favorite part is the page at the end which includes several clear plastic pockets in which he inserts the included dinosaur cards to hear how certain dinosaurs might have interacted if they came in contact. I gave my son a snack-size resealable bag to store his cards in so they're less likely to become "extinct"! The folks at LeapPad thoughtfully included a "wild card" that can function as any of the dinosaurs in the collection in case one (or more) of the cards should happen to go missing. I am completely satisfied with this addition to our growing LeapPad library 
 Like some of the other reviewers said this was a quick read.  Not just because it is light.  It is also a likeable book.  There are some exagerations though (you don't have to drive to Endicott for a the New York Times though who knows maybe you did in 87).  It has a cute ending in that he winds up liking Delaware County very much.   
 Oh man. My friends and I went to Blockbuster to look for movies, and saw this movie. The cover looked totally tremendously spectacular! it was like.. omfg it owns the matrix special effect. The motorcycles were totally cool looking, and theyr swords are SO AWESOME, CUS THEY WERE CLEAR!. and oh man, i love how they recycle scenes over and over and put funny buzzing noises everytime the awesome motorcycles roll bye. The BEST, AND I MEAN BEST PART about this movie is when the girl gets naked in the torture chamber omg, my friends mom came in while we were watching, and we changed it right away, but thats another story. HAHA OMFG, THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME, the girl is hot too! and i love their ray guns, where whatever they shoot just dissapears, i also love how things explode for no reason. Yeah thats about it. A+!! I REALLY SUGGEST YOU BUY THIS MOVIE!... lol oh man... their swords... are... GREAT 
 I have purchased Shalamov's short story compilation in 1989 in Hungarian edition. The author's picture was on the back most probably an old camp photograph that struck me because in it he looked like a man having suffered a lot and being close to the end.  When I started reading them I wondered how could someone write stories in a way he did. He had no sensible emotion towards the players neither positive nor negative, yet I was moved by the stories.  I bought Kolyma Tales in English because it contained a wider compilation than the other edition (turned out later that it still did not contain several stories that the other version did; still I have to look for more?). Some new stories were equally as good as those in the other book, some were just a snapshot of a situation or short series of events. A few were tiring to read perhaps because of the many other ones that I read previously, I felt these somewhat less interesting. But the closing few stories are really good. On the other hand I miss very much "Course" from this compilation (Hungarian edition did contain it). This is the tale that helps us understand how and why Shalamov managed to survive.  It was interesting to compare the Hungarian text and the English text. I have found some minor differences at places. These were generally phrasing differences, that is, not the exact words were used (as if each translator had used different original text), but the meaning was achieved (still I'd be curious how it is really written in Russian). In particular, one example of this is in "Lawyers' Plot", when the guards and Andreev talk to reach other in a roadside buffet where they stopped for the night on the way to their destination, involving a third prisoner. There is even some extra words/sentences in this English version compared to the Hungarian one.  For those who have never read Shalamov's tales I strongly suggest buying and reading it. The typesetting of this book is very eye friendly enabling reading easy. And entertainment is guaranteed even if it is an eery one 
 Nature Cures presents the history of alternative medicine in America, showing that the recent rise of alternative medicine actually reflects two centuries of competition between mainstream medicine and unorthodox systems. In providing a running history of alternative medicine, author James Whorton enables readers to analyze the progress, successes and failures of both traditional and alternative treatments 
 I love this film and both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones' portrayals within it.  Most are familiar with the story: a Chicago-based vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kincaid (Ford) returns home to find an intruder and his wife nearly dead from the attack. The CPD cannot substantiate the story and believe the good doctor murdered his wife instead.  Dr. Kincaid is sentenced to death by lethal injection due to the particularly heinous nature of the crime. He gets a lucky break when the inmates on his prisoner transport break out.  Instead of running for the border, Dr. Kincaid returns to Chicago to find the person who killed his wife.  U. S. Marshal Sam Girard is assigned to the case---Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal in this particular film was what spawned his role in "US Marshals" another case where he ends up proving the innocence of the person he is seeking.  
 Jessica Lange does an excellent job in portraying Frances Farmer.  Not only does she resemble her physically, but her actinig is remarkable and it is no wonder that she won an Oscar.  This movie is incredible and really makes you think, about Frances Farmer and how the mentally ill are treated.  This movie does have some disturbing images though and I would not recommend it for younger children.  With those images though, it provides you with an actual picture of the horrible brutality in which Frances Farmer was treated.  This movie is very good, but only to be watched by people that can handle disturbing images 
 this book is good for when you're writing essays and you can't remember a certain format or something and you can flip through the book real quick for examples of essays, outlines and thesis statements, although I wish i had the cd version of it so i can always have it with me instead of toting around the book. they could have made the format of the book better.  for instance i remember seeing a book called "A Writers reference" both are MLA format and one came from my community college and just the way its put together is better over all than this one 
 Wow!  This is Good Stuff.  If books were dessert, this would be one where you savor each bite.  Then you would be tempted to ask for seconds and guess what?  The author has already generously provided!  It would be hard to say which is the better plate, the first or the second; both are rich without being weighty.  I loved the intimate portraits of the people in the stories--the personal connection created by the eloquent disclosure of their thoughts.  This is a book worthy of kicking off your shoes, curling up in a comfy chair and allowing yourself to be absorbed by 
 This book was every bit as good a book as I have ever read. I felt like a friend had walked away from me once I completed it. The characters were never boring,the content took you right into the life of Francie Nolan. It is still hard for me to understand the depth of poverty some children lived in while growing up in Ireland. Frank McCourt's book "Tis" was very good, this one is just as good. I would and have recommended this book to every avid reader I know.  
 I love both soundtracks, but i wonder if anyone knows how to get ahold of the version Jonathan Davis does in the movie.  I noticed that different artists do the songs from the movie on the soundtrack, but in the actual movie...it was Jonathan singing some of those songs.  I want to get that version too!!  Does anyone know how to get it??? 
 Item was in (as described) like new condition. Was shipped pronptly and packaged well 
 The 'Introduction' says the Supreme Court is the highest court and final forum. It operates in absolute secrecy, only revealing its judgments in formal written opinions. Their decision making has been kept secret from the people who are affected. This book tells about the inner workings of the Burger Court from 1969 to 1976. The Supreme Court can reinterpret laws, the Constitution, and prior cases. Numerous confidential sources provided information. It tells how 'LIFE' magazine was used to discredit Abe Fortas  to force his resignation (pp.18-19). Page 21 gives the political reasons for Burger's selection. Page 24 suggests the fix was in: the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously recommended Burger. The next seven chapters cover the years 1969 to 1975; each Supreme Court term coves one year from October to June or early July.  Do you know that newspapers manipulate the news (p.31)? [You can see this if your area has more than one newspaper.] One of Burger's first actions was against the rigorous code of ethics proposed for federal judges by Earl Warren (p.32). Next he restricted the normal intercommunication between the law clerks (pp.34-35). Was Burger "petty, unpleasant, and dishonest" (p.71)? Page 85 tells how Burger tried to change the rules to benefit a monopoly. This was a violation of judicial restraint and strict constructionism! Burger then backed down from Douglas' proposed dissent. While the emphasis is on Warren Earl Burger, the personalities and characters of the other Judges are displayed. Many cases were undecided because the Court was deadlocked 4 to 4. Blackmun would provide the deciding vote on these and future cases. This ended Burger's first term as Chief Justice. This book seems slow-paced in covering many details about the Justices. After 25 years, this then important story has faded into the background of history. But its important to understand that the Justices are politicians who do not need popular approval. This book does not go into much detail as to why a specific judge was picked.  The "Constitutional Journal" by Jeffrey St. John was written as a journalistic summary of the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Article III Section 1 defined the Court system. They left further changes to Congress. There is nothing in Section 1 that mandates life-tenure, except by default. Congress could specify a term for a fixed number of years, or an age limit. There are examples from history for an age limit. There were six Justices in Washington's era, seven for Jefferson, and nine for Jackson. About one Justice for every two states. If this example was followed we could have had twenty-one Justices by FDR's era. This could allow more work to be done more quickly. 
 This book is a very good book.  These Science ideas are a sure hit in any classroom.  You can use it over and over.  Also many of these can be changed to fit an older group or a younger group.  I can't stress how wonderful this book is 
 I purchased this book from a seller here which came to me reeking of smoke and discolored.  Getting through the smell,the book kept my interest. I've searched through many books looking for the right one to study and this one explains in more detail "how to". Trottier shows you how to set your margins,dialogue, character's front page and much more.  Even if you don't have a Manager or an Agent the book will show you how to sell your manuscript without them. For beginners I would tell them this book has everything you need from start to finish.  
 I could not put this book down.  It is written by an astute, highly credible and objective biblical scholar who  has no axe to grind one way or the other on this topic.  You get the facts, simply the facts.  How refreshing!  This book was a life saver, as I struggled with whom and what to believe about Jesus, the Gospels and the history of the early church.  If you can get only one book on this topic, this should be the one. 
 This book is really exciting for any child that has read it. When I first read it to my sister, she had  great simle in her face when the book said "Elmo loves you !" I like this book because it makes children know how the Sesame Street characters have in common with them because the both like noises, bubble gum, toys, and books 
 True fans of Alfred Hitchcock pictures who know little about the man personally can get great insight into his character by reading Francios Truffaut's interviews. Mr. Hitchcock appears to have been a flawed genius who believed he always had the ability to create the perfect picture. Reading this made his comparison of actors and cattle make sense. Having now read several filmmaker-to-filmmaker interview books (Welles-Bogdanovich, Wilder-Crowe among them) I would not count this the best, but it is certainly among them. The book made me look deeper into Hitchcock's work and gave me new insight into all his films. What more could one who is interested this genre ask 
 This book is fantastic for people who are becoming vegan, or people who have been vegan for awhile but need to ensure they are getting all the nutrients they need! Highly recommended 
 This book is a great book for the IB curriculum if the teachers are rooting for you to fail...this is what i thought the first time i read this book...then i read it again and again and again. and i annotated passages and went online to search for the answer...then i relaized there was no answer, Rulfo wanted us, as the readers, to believe whatever we want to believe about the town of Comala and Preciado's end. This book is timeless, switches between first and third person narrative, past and present and shows how one man's endeavor to find his father can become a surrealistic tale involving the souls of the dead who wander in Limbo around Comala waiting...we see the greivances of father renteria; the murdering rapist miguel; the suicide of eduviges. we see the sins the people of Comala were driven to under the rule of Preciado's father, paramo, which means wasteland. Rulfo shows us how Comala became a ghost town through seemingly unconnected narratives of events in the past, of Preciado's mothers marriage to paramo and the reasons behind it; Their wedding night, which never happened; paramo as he grew up; we follow paramo through the death of the only son he acknowledged; and finally, through the death of his last wife, Susana, who was in love with a dead man. Susana is the 'final nail in the coffin' as she was the onbly thing that could have saved Comala from what was otherwise an inevitable fate.   This book is amazing for those who have an open-mind, read it carefully, and dont try to hard to understand it.. 
 Having seen the film that this book is based on several times, I was curious to read into the whole story... and this book does not pack any punches. Whilst I did not expect a 'G' rated book, I certianly did not expect some of the in depth writing that is included.  However it is all relevant to the story. Definately a book for our times 
 I have eaten at Gaku Homma's restrant, Domo's, and it is wonderful but I can't eat there as often as I would like.  Not that expensive but being a student I can't aford going out to eat very often unless it is McDoalds dollar menu. I bought his book and it has made it a bit eiser for me to eat good food.  I also enjoy the stories behind the food and his life experiances 
 Whoever thought of the idea of putting a handle on a hard cover book is a genius.  It's perfect for a 2-3 year old to tote the book everywhere with them.  My 3 year old son loves Buzz & Woody and this was a great gift.  He carries it to him to bed, and carries it with him when he gets up.  Wished they had more Disney books with the handle 
 The only real reason to tackle the massive burden of Ulysses is to become aware of the stark reality that it expresses regarding the "spirit of the age", essentially a rampant nihilism.  Then one can possibly adjust one's outlook on the current world society and proceed accordingly, perhaps avoiding being a lemming going over the cliff.  Before entering the cavern of this work, one has to decide the "why" as above, then the "how".  For me, after much diddling, false starts and self deceptions, this excellent CD set became the obvious answer.  I had heard the comments of people far more intelligent than I on how difficult the work was to plow through.  Therefore, I would have even more difficulty than they if I chose to continue reading it (a false start at reading the 735 page tome got almost nowhere).  Also, I would be displaying a gracious nature in accepting the much-touted idea that "Joyce's prose must be HEARD to be truly appreciated".   The production here is an excellent way to expose oneself in a leisurely manner to the book's wily trap without becoming totally enmeshed.  The trap is simply that one thinks the work is "going to say something", but the fact remains that it really says nothing, albeit in a brilliant way.    One can be tired but still listen to part of a CD, repeat passages at will, turn it off, reflect, then continue.  It is MUCH harder to read this work than to listen to it.   The CD set also contains very valuable and detailed notes about each section as well as overall enlightening critical information, and relevant musical selections are also present throughout.  If one is truly serious about attacking this work, I would recommend the sort of "Joyce for Dummies" approach that I followed:  purchase the DVD of the film version of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (although the film doesn't boast a very good screenplay and is unrestored, the performances are excellent), as well as the CD audio book of the same title (abridged, but all the important parts are there).  Absorbing these will give you a central clue about Ulysses, mostly in the Stephen Dedalus character that appears in both (hint: Stephen is a boring, cold, emotionless prig).  Then purchase the DVD of the 1967 film version of Ulysses (excellent photography in a pristine black and white print).  Although set in 1967, it will give you a reasonably OK overview of the "story" of Ulysses which is set in 1904.    Having taken in these, you are almost ready to proceed to the CD set of Ulysses, and you can already rightly claim to have listened to the prose of Joyce, definitely a feather in your cap at certain parties (where you may also want to rhyme off a few memorized lines in the appropriate accent).    Avoid the millions of words contained in endless musings about the book, and read only one essay, that of Carl Jung entitled Ulysses in the book The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature.  If read carefully and more than once before listening to the Ulysses CD set, you'll find that it does indeed contain the golden key to truly understanding the nature of this massively influential book. 
 This is a well-written, comprehensive and easy to read book. I highly recommend it for a student or general reader who wants to learn about the political climate in 20th Century Africa. This book is focused on trends and yet does a good job of differentiating between the different experiences across regions and countries of Africa 
 Great DVD.  Very funny I enjoy watching this one over and ove 
 This is one of the best book of my personal library.  I think maximalism is what the next graphic design approach is all about. I think it comes to fix the "form & function" ideal - I think it has been misunderstood, too focused on the function, the designs was been to much "Bauhaus", art deco, minimalistic. Our architeture nowadays is an easy way to identify this minimal and "too much function" ideal. It was good then, but now everyone is tired of the boredom (at least I am). "Life is much more colorful and fun"   I just wish the book were more extensive.  Now I am very curious to check of the other books from the author, especially Poster-Art and Mag-Art.   ***Wonderful designed book. From the copper & golden cover to the layout, everything comes together nicely. Another great hit from Wilson Harvey.  Have fun 
 In the preface of this book the author emphasizes that this book is intended for medical students and the general medical field. I skimmed to Chapter 6 since that is where I began to understand what was going on without looking up every other word for comprehension purposes. I am surprised that there is not more diagrams on the this subject matter like on page 266 & 303. It would probably save a student some study time (instead of referring to other sources ie books, the web, or etc to figure out a particular subject matter in this book).    The list of Abbreviations on page xiii was very helpful in understanding some of the verbiage in Endocrine Physiology.  Review on some of the chapters:  Chapter 7 - Laboratory Evaluation of Endocrine Discussion points on secreting profile and the circadian rhythm offers interesting viewpoints on the coritsol levels in the body.   Chapter 9 - Endocrine Pancreas Discusses the endocrine pancreas and it provides a good explanation about Type I & II diabetics. It also mentions a correlation between gestational diabetics & Type II diabetics.  Chapter 13- Reproductive Endocrinology Discussion points on Pheromonal signals & the menstrual cycle, obesity and endometrial cancer, and PMS symptoms and sources for relief. Additionally, pages 581-583 reviews the development of breast cancer correlated to genes, pregnancy & age, and obesity. 
 this book is a well-crafted and well-informed, simple and direct introduction to the challenging subject of electromagnetic radiation.  It is an important tool for consumers and community activists who want to  understand how what we cannot see can and does affect us.  The  proliferation of "wireless" technology is something that impacts  all our lives in many ways; this book is a crucial first step to  understanding and questioning these crucial impacts.  Charts, illustrations  and good, clear writing makes accessible what could be obscure.  Thank you  B. Blake Levitt 
 This short, illustrated book provides a compact and useful introduction to tropical fish commonly kept in aquarium tanks.  The book goes into detail of how to set up a tank, how to maintain it, and what fish to put into it.  The book comes complete with color pictures of the various fish, their characteristics and the challenges of keeping them in an aquarium tank.  The book itself is quite inexpensive, and worth the cost and time to read it 
 Good quality and durability for any price!  Our back yard is in the direct sun all-day.  This umbrella is perfect for our yard because of the 11' canopy, and durability.  It gets quite windy in the afternoon, and the umbrella has held up well to rain, wind, & sun.  The only problem I had was the width of the pole.  It is too large to fit in out standard pool side tables.  I had to buy a heavy stand that would fit the 2" pole.  Problem solved!  Now I have a GREAT umbrella and a very heavy stand that seems to be the perfect accessory to our back yard, at a reasonable price.  Oh, and they delivered it before I thought they would. 
 If you are out of USA and ship with Transexpress please dont buy this because the ship value is 374$ :S and the item just 87$ but the Eclipse 12 look cool! 
 It's sad to see how [poorly] the poster art for the Bond films have become in the past decade. But this collection allows you to relish the amazing images and see Bond around the world 
 To me, what makes this book so appealing is the variety of familiar and more unexpected creatures that are to be found "in the tall, tall grass," and what makes it remarkable is the perspective from daylight to dark.  The text bites and Eric Carle style illustrations do not seem particularly original or unique to me beyond that (though others might disagree: its was an American Library Association Notable Book and a Boston Globe Horn Book Honor Book in 1992), but it its still an enjoyable, good quality read for budding naturalists and youngsters who are curious about the world around them 
 If you are a fan of the Winter's Solstice series, than you will enjoy this cd, especially if you like the earlier volumes with the more original pieces rather than mostly traditional christmas music. 
 Mrs. Kent's story applies to each of in the hard places of life.  We all have an "Isaac" - the person or thing closest to our hearts, our future hopes and dreams - that must be layed down.  In telling her story, Mrs. Kent illustrates the difficulty of this, yet demonstrates that it can be done.  She doesn't gloss over the pain, yet doesn't leave us there, either.  She shows us there is hope 
 I purchased this book in the hope of finding some ideas on designing spells, not so much for the spell itself but the process before casting and general preperation. It sevred its purpose well and included various spells which is always a bonus, most of the spells seem a bit fluffy however i believe this to be as the author has the kindest intentions which is a good thing (the summary of various herbs to keep in a spell kit are nearly all for love and protection).   It has a fair bit of information however it can lack detail a bit but i guess all one requires are a few hints to nudge the intuition. overall a good book and i have a feeling the author knows what they are talking about ;)  Enjoy! 
 Has everything and more inside. Great price concidering how much you get. Literally has like $100 of stuff in it 
 When leading edge technology comes to light, many would find it hard to understand. However Stephen Lewis does an excellent job of showcasing how the Spritual Technology of EMC2 helps a person to self-heal. This is a simple read on a complex topic. What I loved about this book was that it taught a subject in an entertaining way 
 The last track as you say the remix of Bwomp, it isnt a remix you dumb@$$ Its from there 2nd cd superbuick Track 1 is Bwomp and the last track is also Bwomp which is that "rap song" they just put them together, learn your facts i hate people like yo 
 In depth, though provoking reading for those seeking deep, meaningful reflection. 
 This is the book that taught me English -- and it's fun and easy to read and very helpful to young children or ESL kids. I highly recommend it -- there are so many items and characters on a page that today's kids won't get bored of it. And the artwork is lovely. I've bought this book many times 
 Having read some of Jensen's material before, I had an idea of what to expect. With this book, the authors compare all of the attitudes and institutions of society to a machine, designed to convert "human beings to workers", to turn individuals into "cogs". Basically, the machine exists to control and direct the actions of the masses, for the purpose of achieving the goals of the few. While I like the writing style, the second half of this book can be quite tedious. During the first half, the basis for the machine is established, and the arguments made by the authors can be humorous and compelling. As the book progresses though, I got the feeling that every point had already been made, and the rest of the book mainly consists of those points being reinforced by listing endless examples. In the chapter "Money", the author spends several pages simply listing ways in which the government spends money. While this does help to hammer the point home, it makes a tiresome read. Still, the first half of the book alone makes it worth the read, and the second half comes in handy if you get into an argument with someone and want to bombard them with facts and numbers. If you like Jensen, this book shouldn't disappoint 
 This preliminary review of this 'The Greek New Testament' is nothing more than a warning that this edition does NOT contain an interlinear translation. I did not look out for this fact and expected it to be like so many other Greek New Testaments with literal English under the Greek. I will do a more detailed review when I am in a better position to appreciate it. At the moment, I can only echo other reviewers to say that this is a superbly portable little volume with excellent binding, plus a Greek dictionary (all in ancient Greek characters, not anglicized Greek)at the back of the book.  If, like me you are just starting out with Greek, you may wish to look for an interlinear edition 
     On the Cornish coast in Great Britain, retired DI Frank Elder is faced with several problems. On a personal level his marriage has fallen apart and he is trying to foster his relationship with his sixteen year old daughter. On a professional level Shane Donald has just been released from prison and escaped from a half way house. Fourteen years ago, Shane Donald and Alan McKiernan were arrested for the brutal rape and slaying of a young girl. Now another young girl has disappeared and all fingers appear to be pointing to Shane. Elder was responsible for the original arrests and is now hired as a consultant in the case given that he knows Shane. However, as Elder investigates, things get way too close to home.      John Harvey has written a superb character rich crime novel in the same vein as Ian Rankin, Peter Robinson or Reginald Hill. Specifically I am referring to the leisurely paced novel that truly centers on the police officer almost to the subjugation of the plot. When done right there are few works that compare in terms of richness of language, character and the locale itself. This is a very impressive work and it is the subtle tension of the missing women and the subsequent murders that truly keep the pages turning. My one gripe is the truly disappointing ending which any reader of the genre would have picked out near the beginning of the book. I felt it was both a cheap and a manipulative device. However, this is one of the best books of the year,overall and a worthy winner of the CWA Silver dagger 
 I finished Orhan Pamuk's _My name is Red_ just over an hour ago, and the pleasant euphoria of having finished a truly great book is just beginning to wear off. In short - read it.   I have to take issue with the marketing for this book, though, and I have some symapathy for those who picked up this book expecting a good murder mystery and were disappointed. I have to blame the publishers and the booksellers for this one - I bought it looking for something fun. Two of the three reviews on the cover, as well as the back blurb describe it was "sinful" and the blurb calls it "a kaleidoscopic journey into the intersection of art, religion, love, sex, and power." All of these descriptions are misleading.   _My name is Red_ is a book about art - in general, and the differences between Eastern and Western art in particular. Before reading, I had never thought about the causes or consequences of style, perspective, and composition in art, and the cultural and religious causes of differences in these components. I think that after reading _My name is Red_, I feel like I will have a much greater appreciation and understanding of these things - and a few more wrinkles in my brain. : ) .   A few have commented on the translation - I don't know any Turkish, but I didn't notice any glaring or awkward phrasing that poorly translated books can have - (Murakami's novels spring to mind).   All in all, this was a fantastic read. Highly recommended. 
 This is definitely a quick but good read.  If I begin to go into detail, it will ruin it for you; however, it is about one Miss Emily Grierson, who is from a respectable family of which she is the sole remaining descendent.   She remains shrouded in a cloud of private mystery with only the  occasional entry or departure of her black servant to provide her with the  basic necessites from the outside world.  After a small accumulation of  seemingly unconnected incidents, the story ends on a horrifying and ghastly  note, which manages to leave the reader confident that he knows what the  ending means, but at the same time is left hanging uncertainly.  I would  also like to strongly recommend _The Sound and the Fury_ to anyone who has  enjoyed this or any of Faulkner's works 
 It was a pleasure to reread this wonderful book. It took me back to my youth. I lost it and never got around to replacing it, I am enthralled to have it again in my hands. I highly recomend any of his books and also the site that lets you talk and discuss all of the metaphors in this book. a great read and insight into someones life thoughts. Yours in lit. J.C.M 
  Flush by Carl Hiaasen does not disappoint! Who knew that a story about raw sewage would rate five stars! Hiaasen's Flush does just that! Noah and his sister Abby acquire some strange cohorts along the way as they try to keep their family from going down the drain! Sorry, but I just couldn't resist that pun! Their father's action in sinking a floating casino leads them on a quest to not only help their father but to save the environment. Along the way you will see how setbacks will sometimes end up as a success while their successes often end up having unwanted consequences! This was a Christmas present for our oldest granddaughter.  She loved it! Carl Hiaasen is a terrific author. His writing has made us laugh out loud numerous times. While this was written as a children's book, it was just as enjoyable for me to read as those geared to adults 
 This is an incredibly helpful book.  Not only do the authors explain just how the stomach and GI system is supposed to work, they make a stunning case for how 21st century pharmaceutically-driven medical practice is completely off course when it comes to treating common digestive problems.  The authors offer a range of good practical suggestions on how to manage your symptoms while encouraging your stomach to function normally again.  I suffered from heartburn for 20 years and had the symptoms of low stomach acid for 5 or more years which was never properly diagnosed.  Since reading this book and following the authors' advice, I have not taken any stomach acid suppressors for over a year now--I now have no heartburn, no gas, and no pain.  Yes, it's possible!  Do yourself a huge favor and read this book 
 Great compilation here. Ferry is truly number 1 and this dual-disc shows why. 1st CD awesome funky electro house, which has recently become a new favorite of mine. 2nd CD brings out some lesser played trance tracks. Ferry masters the flow of these sets and takes you on a journey like only he can! I'm only droppin 4 stars on this because there's some tracks I feel couldve been swapped for some better ones. Keep a lookout for his L.E.F. artist CD coming out soon! Gonna knock your socks off! Take care, and F for life 
 I recently bought this for my 2 year-old son, and he immediately fell in love with it. It's a lovely little story about a relatively uneventful day in the life a young boy. It perfectly captures the mood of the first day of a major snowfall-quiet, magical, and peaceful--even in a bustling urban environment. It's amazing how a story with so few words can so beautifully convey the spirit and wonder of the mind of a little boy. My son particularly loves when Peter knocks some snow on his head and when he tries to save a snowball in his pocket 
 I can't add much more to the terrific and comprehensive album review that sums up in a nutshell what Bobby Bare has done for Country Music. I have this album as well as the bonus tracks on vinyl and although the quality of the tracks are excellent and the fact that I have already converted them to a cd, this has not stopped me ordering this album.  There has never been an equal to Bobby Bare in song rendition.  He interprets the songs with such meaning that you can actually live inside of them.  Because he was so many years ahead of the dreary country scene at the time, he never received the recognition that was due to him.  Therefore, this album will be appreciated in this day and age much more than it did in its time.  I rate this as a true masterpiece from a man that should have been inducted to the Country Hall Of Fame a long time ago.  If I as a South African can appreciate the "Bare" then all I can say is "Wake up American country fans and smell the roses".  Do something about this injustice to Country Music  C. J. Loc 
 I love this album, and that is based on one song- "I Used To Be A  Sailor".  I'm not a sailor, and honestly there has been little in my  life to cause the frustration this piece speaks about- but this song spoke  to me.  I enjoy the rest of the album, but when choosing a Tracy Chapman CD  to travel with- I choose this one because of that one song 
 I really like this book. I have found some good "Ah haa" and  thought provoking moments. This is a book I have been telling many others about. Just in saying that ...it says GREAT read. I think many of us need to get back to the cross and really see, hear and feel it from Jesus the man. I love how Mr. Edwards has open my eyes up to another view point. If you want more of Jesus, read this book 
 Lehane's first work is just a taste of things to come.  He's not quite as masterful here as in future novels, there are spots where the novel slows, but not quite stills.    "A Drink Before the War" refers to the drink Patrick Kenzie shares with his three new employers:  some of Boston's 'old school' politicians.  The trio has a problem---a Statehouse cleaning woman has absconded with what they proport to be important documents.   This is not the first thing to be 'not as it seems.' Kenzie and his parter, Angela Gennaro, quickly discover the woman and the photographs the pols were looking for.  The initial photo shows one of the trio in a hotel room with a man who looks to be a pimp.   From there, layers peel off.  We discover Patrick's relationship with his hero father, Angie's with her husband, and the relationship between a father and son whose fight will potentially destroy Boston.   Like most of LeHane's work, "Drink" is hard to put down. He's got a way with words that adds just just a spice of black humor to what would otherwise be a difficult situation. This is well worth a read--I'll definitely continue on with Kenzie and Gennaro.    
 Bend It Like Beckham is a very enjoyable coming of age film for teen aged girls.  The film sensitively portrays a young Indian girl's difficulties in convincing her parents that playing soccer is a worthwhile activity that can help her develop her identity and well being.  The film is enjoyable on several levels: 1) there is the cultural clash between Britons of various descent, 2) there is the hilarious "lesbian" mixup, and 3) the pure sports film.  All in all a very enjoyable experience and a great film for young people 
 Even if this one is not quite as powerful as "I Married A Dead Man", and the ending doesn't pay off quite as fully as you might hope, it is still a very involving and typically stylish piece of storytelling that grabs you in chapter one and holds on tight till it's done with you. It also contains one of the most powerful single chapters I've ever read- a set piece in which a mysterious woman stalks a bartender simply by staring at him and following him until his nerves begin to crumble- which could stand alone as a short story superior to the novel as a whole. As a reading experience, this is a genuine treat, and the book itself- a faithful facsimile of the first edition- is beautiful to look at and a great pleasure to own. A bargain at the original price and a steal on sale. Thank you again, Otto Penzler 
 Doctor Beck and his wife Elizabeth fell in love when they were 12 years old. They spent their teenage years together, and ended up getting married as adults. Every year on their anniversary, the two would go to the tree where they had their first kiss and add a notch under their initials. But on their 13th anniversary, when they came back to the tree, Elizabeth is kidnapped and murdered.   Trying to move on with his life, Beck dates some women here and there, but he can't seem to find the perfect relationship. 8 years after Elizabeth disappears, Beck recieves a mysterious e-mail and a picture of Elizabeth on his computer that makes him go nuts. The message warns Beck to "tell no one". As Beck tries to figure it out, he is accused of the murder of 2 other bodies found in the same location Elizabeth was kidnapped. Trying to prove his innocence, Beck finds out that Elizabeths Best Friend has been murdered too. While David tries to resolve the mystery of his supposedly dead wife, nothing will stop him.   I would deffinatley reccommend this book to anyone. It is one great fast paced mystery that you can't put down. Every chapter leaves you hanging with possibilites, either leading you in the wrong direction, or to the unthinkable. The characters in this book were also great. I really liked David, because he was protrayed as such a caring and loving person.  Harlan Coben's writing style was especially good, because he can really make a scene seem real. 
 I read this excellent book over a year ago and am amazed at how often my thoughts return to visit.  I find that many of the folkways described by this extraordianary observer are part of my own everyday life as American Scotch Irish over two centuries removed from roots in Ulster, Ireland.  The descriptions of the kitchen hospitality, even the arrangement of the kitchen furniture are very familiar to me.  The gifts of storytelling and musicmaking so vividly described are as frequently celebrated in my current mileau.  Thanks for an excellent piece of research and writing 
 Very interesting cast of characters, would make an enjoyable TV show, more original than what is on today 
 I really, really enjoyed this.  I didn't think I would. I really hated the title. It started off kind of slowly, and I really disliked the main character, Dena Nordstrom, an up-and-coming television journalist/reporter who focuses on only her career and is experiencing stress-related illness because of it. I didn't really understand a few of the beginning parts, mostly the ones about the folks in Elmwood Springs, but after a bit, I got into them and enjoyed those parts very much. Flagg switches POV almost constantly, and it keeps the book from getting stale.  Dena's illness puts her into therapy (which she attends unwillingly), and her therapist (second one- first one had to send her to a colleague because he fell in love with her) starts to get her to dig up her past, which includes a mother who moved her from place to place constantly and finally abandoned her at age 15. Dena goes back to Elmwood Springs, MO to the only living relatives she has, to try to find out WHY her mother left.  This, my friends, is something you wouldn't expect. I was amazed when I realized WHY her mother left. I never saw it coming. Very, very interesting book, everything weaves together very nicely. Great plot, great story, great characters. Wonderful book, very highly recommended 
 This is the album that made me worship Randy Newman.  It is definitely for thinking people.  I have bought every album since but this one remains my favorite 
 Please write an email to disney requesting the release of season 4 of BMW. It was supposed to be released in Jan of 06' then supposedly Feb, but there is still no news of its release. If you want the other seasons of BMW to be released write a quick email to them telling them how much you want it. Here's their email: Disney: disneyinfo@disneyhelp.com Thanks 
 A highly recommended book. An amazing and interesting information is revealed here. Learn how to grow, to master the game, and to think like the millionaire. This book is helpful and comprehensive, try to follow it, you might start a new life 
 There is an old expression that half of knowing anything is knowing where to find it. And there is little more frustrating to be looking at 'My Computer' trying to find what you know you have stored in a file somewhere. Well, perhaps just as frustrating is to go to one of the search engines and try to find something that you know is there but just don't know the proper words to find it.   In this book Dr. Konchady talks about how to go find data that is in text form on your system, on your network or out on the web somewhere. It talks about search engines, but also about other techniques that can be used only by programming.   The CD that comes with the book contains several Perl software snippets that help to find named entities, parts of speech, phrases and gives a summary of text documents. This area includes developing web crawlers that can be adapted by individual users to go out and find specialized information. It further contains an Open Source software package called Text Mine that is designed for mining operations. In addition it has utilities to build and enhance Text Mine and utilities to build and manage MySQL database tables. This is an excellent book on everything from the basic hints and types through some of the mathematics that underlies text mining.   His section on the nature of an English language Question and Answer system is the best I've ever seen 
 I'm not one to explain or understand most audio specs, compare systems or buy the most expensive audio components there are. This 3 piece self-powered speaker system was recommended by a coworker and the user reviews certainly helped in the decision making process. Still, I was doubtful, of course, as I love my gizmos and the price was under $120.00.  What kind of quality could this be for that price?  Let me tell you, I am blown away, ESPECIALLY considering the price!  Roughly $113.00, shipping and tax included and my whole 13x20 room rocks!  FYI, I listen to everything from Marvin Gaye, Nine Inch Nails, Acoustic to Beethoven.  It plugs in via the same adapter as your headphones so there are no delays in the subwoofer like what usually occurs with the USB connected woofers.  The plastic is a tough and heavy material so don't worry about them cracking under normal use, and since the sticks are tall, the base of the sticks are made of a heavy, rubbery material so they won't fall over or slide unless your head-banging on top of beer kegs.  The right Sound Stick contains the + & - volume adjustment sensors that take some time to get used to considering most computers have 2 other sources of volume control -the operating system's and the music player you use.  I call them sensors because they don't move, they are like those cool lamps that brighten and dim when touched.  Overall, if you a person who wants a nice sound system for your computer that you can hear from a few rooms away and are not sure what to buy or how much to spend, this is the way to go 
 There is an often obsessive, dreamlike quality to the writing of Julio Cortazr, and this quality is typically conveyed through the most prosaic and plausible details.   Cortazr, an Argentinean, was born in Brussels in 1914, raised in Buenos Aires, and spent most of his career in Paris, where he died in 1984. He wrote with an exile's knowledge of the transitional and malleable characteristics of identity and reality, and this is one of the major themes of the stories contained in this classic collection translated by the poet, Paul Blackburn.  A cosmopolitan and international literary figure in his lifetime, Cortazr was influenced by Poe, the French Symbolists, and the Surrealists, and he shared with them a penchant for subject matter of a mysterious and metaphysical nature, and a pronounced radical outlook. What set him apart were the highly credible, even mundane situations and circumstances that he invented in his stories as springboards to the fantastic.  Take, for example, the story that lends its title to this collection, and to Michaelangelo Antonioni's celebrated film that it inspired, "Blow-Up." In Cortazr's original story, set in Paris, (not Swinging London, as in the film), the protagonist is a translator and amateur photographer, who observes a young woman and an adolescent boy in a public square, and casually shoots the scene with his Contax 1.1.2. He later develops the film, enlarges the picture, and by studying the blow-up surmises that the woman was attempting to seduce the boy for an older man sitting in a nearby car.   The photographic scene, and the botched assignation it depicts, encroaches on the photographer's life, and he speaks of himself both in the fist person and third persons in the story. "Nobody really knows who is telling it, if I am I or what actually occurred or what I'm seeing," he says, "Or if, simply I'm telling a truth which is only my truth." As the photographer is a translator by trade, the statement increases in complexity and levels of meaning.  (In his film version, Antonioni borrowed the story's theme of "appearance versus reality," and wove from it an open-ended murder mystery. It is fascinating to read phrases from this very different story, and to see how they were reinterpreted and re-imagined in the Italian director's first English language film.)  Another story, "Axolotl," is told by a human narrator who so identifies with the axolotls (the larval stage of a certain species of salamander) in an aquarium that he actually becomes an axolotl. The character does not assume his non-human identity dramatically as the character Gregor Samsa does in Kafka's "Metamorphosis," but rather through a process of protracted observation and empathy with these languid creatures. In the course of the story he speaks of humans and axolotls in both the first person and third persons.  This story hints at the covert political content of Cortazr's writing of this period, and it is not too much of a stretch to interpret this transition from human to non-human, and active to motionless creature as a veiled critique of political inaction and social conformity--maybe even that of the exile's position of distance and non-engagement.  The other thirteen tales in the collection are each distinguished by their own exquisite details, absurd reality, and plausible implausibility.  In the end, it seems unfair to marginalize Cortazr as a "Latin American Writer," (or "Magic Realist"), and the labels seems as inadequate and imprecise as tagging Joyce an "Irish Writer," or Nabokov a "Russian Writer."  Like these other literary exiles, Cortazr invented his own worlds, and created a singular oeuvre universal in its themes, and unique in its imagination.    
 Napoleon Hill's gift to each of us who reads and rereads this astounding life recipe is priceless. I remain in awe of his rigour, insight and persistence. If you haven't read this book, buy it now, read it and read it again. Then do Hill's exercises exactly as he advises and the world will shift beneath your feet. 
 I like this album.  I bought it recently and I found it to be very pleasing.  If I HAD to choose though, it wouldn't be my #1 album.  REally, I think Zade is far more important an artist and his music really shows it.  But still.. a good album 
 This book is well-written, focused and deals well with all tangible issues relating to college students.  It skips trivial things like stocking up on Kleenex or how to do laundry, and gets to the heart of the matter on issues such as preparing a successful sleep schedule, different diets for different day plans and allowing ways to manage stress.  It is a great companion book to "The Dorm Room Diet," but while TDRD is a diet book only, the Smith's manage to write an entire book on issues related to student problems.  Both are great books, but I recommend this one more.  The voice of the mother and son is one I think most can learn from, which is why I prefer this book.  The son is clearly writing for an audience of his peers, but M.J. knows how to relate diet advice to a younger generation, particularly in the ABC plan.  I know I'm giving this book to others over the holiday, after they come home for Thanksgiving to see how much sleep they've lost, or how tight their jeans are 
 This is the best book on Homeopathy I have ever seen (and I have seen quite a few!).  The design, layout, photos, graphics, charts, and text are amazingly well done, and perfect for anyone just getting started in  Homeopathy.  Everything important is cross referenced, and anyone can use  the book to self-prescribe homeopathic remedies for minor illnesses.  The  book is a joy to read, and I have read some of the sections many times  already 
 I've been using the HOOVER WindTunnel Bagless Canister Cleaner with Powered Nozzle for a few weeks now and I have to say.....  This is THE nicest vacuum I've EVER owned.  Everything's easy to opperate since ALL the controls are right there on the handle (ie. off switch, power suction controll, and Carpet Brush on/off switch)!   Not to mention it's THE most user friendly and quiet of vacuum's I've owned.  In one press of a bottom you can go from easily vacuuming pethair infested carpetting to vacuuming bare flooring in the SAME stroke!  What's even cooler (I had to test it's limits just to see) is the built in edge groomer!  I can vacuum up to 2inches from the wall or base board and it'll pick up all and any particals that aren't heavier than a marble (the closer the vacuum gets to the edge of the wall it'll deinfately pick up heavier objects than a marble)!!  The powered hand tool is just the neatest thing you could come across, it removes pethair from uphostery that my other vacuums couldn't (at least not without harming to the material first).  The only set back I for see is the bagless hepa canister needing to be capable of holding about 2x the normal amount.  Which will come in handy if you have to vacuum more than 3 rooms at a time.  Also the powered nozzel could use a stronger hold for keeping the handle upright when not in use.  Other than that, I definately recommend this vacuum to anyone who wants easy to use, compact most-in-one vacuums.  Especially if they have more than one type of surface to vacuum and have a few furry critters hanging around their home.  Although I love the two furballs at my house, up until now it has always a pain to clean up their favorite spots on the rug or sofa 
 This was a great book. It taught me that money is not the best thing in the world and that I should appreciate the things I have today. I recommend this book.  I can't wait to read Begging for Change 
 I bought this book as a reference for a new job.  I found it to be VERY helpful.  It broke down the basics of accounting and went into just enough detail.  I will not only use this at work, but it will help me personaly.  Buy this one.  Cheap and Good.  What more could you want 
 I was required to use this book for my networking programming class.  I'm in my senior year of college and having quite a bit of experience with textbook, I can say with confidence that this is one of the better textbooks out there.  You can definately teach yourself network programming with this book and the accompanied source examples.... makes a handy reference guide as well. Worth the investment for Computer Science Engineers 
 I give it 4 stars because Gloria Estefan is talented.  The only song I like here is "Dont Wanna Lose You now" but even then they overplayed it and I dont like it anymore.  Most songs are just ballads which are good but too many you need to diversify a little.  I suggest "Let It Loose" because the ballads and dance songs are better 
 It's easy to say that this is the best book on renovating barns - it's the only one that I know of. But, this book is very, very good. I'm lucky enough to be able to spend much of my time designing new barns and helping clients restore old ones. I'm amazed and embarrassed by how much I learned from this book. Nick Engler presents a good primer on barn design, and then goes to work, explaining in detail how to repair each and every common problem with old barns. If your barn is leaning, if the stone foundation is buckled, if your pole-barn posts are rotting, if your timbers have splintered, if your roof sways, you'll learn what to do to fix the problem and to keep it from happening again 
  Crackerjack little suspense thriller based on a Graham Greene story about a boy (played by Bobby Henrey) who idolizes the butler (Ralph Richardson) in his residence. Set in a foreign embassy in London, Richardson is having an affair with the embassy secretary (Michele Morgan) and is almost convicted of murdering his battleaxe of a wife (Sonia Dresdel). Keeping secrets and telling little lies, which everyone bombards Henrey with, have a lot to do with the suspense of the movie. The ending, where Henrey almost unwittingly sticks his foot in his mouth to re-implicate Richardson after his innocence has been established is wonderful. The two lovers are a bit pale and bloodless for a couple so illicitly in love, but that's a minor fault in this excellent movie. Carol Reed's direction is superb, especially his work with Henrey 
 I agree with the previous reviewer that said this doesn't have any how/what-to-inspect content, but I think the authors intent was to help those interested in starting their own business.  I think the author assumes you have or know where to get experience/knowledge on home inspection.  He even recommends some sites.  This book really helped me get a feel for the business of home inspection and how/where to start 
 I heard these ladies on a local radio station and purchased this album on a whim. I am quite impressed. Anyone who likes bluegrass music even remotely will like the song craftsmanship and the pure fun these ladies appear to be having 
 For those interested in knowing more about England's wonderful parish churches, this book is a must.  Organized by county, the book should prove useful for travellers like me who fall victim to every village spire.  I appreciated both his wit and knowledge about the subject 
 I listen to this CD when I'm working in my office.  I find that the music is not distracting and actually enhances my ability to concentrate and stay focused 
 "Purity and Danger" is one of the best anthropology books...PERIOD.  You will never look at taboos/pollution/dirt the same way again, after you read this book.  Well, let me rephrase that: if this book doesn't give you a new insight into these matters, it is because you have already been exposed to Douglas's ideas and were not aware of it.  I think that this book is essential for anyone in the social sciences.  It is a great read, and is very powerful.  Social science at its best 
 this album wuz really hot when it first came out n his first single Whats Ur Fantasy is still hot I love it  Top 5:  U Got a Problem? Game Got Switched Whats Your Fantasy Whats Your Fantasy (Remix) Southern Hospitalit 
 This was the plan from the group's inception: to become an empire by taking over the hip hop community through saturation of like minded artists.  You cannot argue with that.  1993. What a year. This marked the release year for possibly the best hip-hop album to come out. "Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" is  an album that you will definitely enjoy. You don't even have to be a big hip-hop fan to enjoy this. Wu-Tang Clan are a band that has actual depth in their lyrics, not the processed crap that you hear on MTV nowadays. The group also incorporates Chinese themes like kung-fu in their songs (listen to the intro to "Shame on a N*gga"). And the beats, you can't help but follow along to the beats. It's just that great of an album.   As I said before, even if you loathe rap/hip-hop with every bone in your body, give "Enter The Wu-Tang" a shot. You won't regret it 
 I love this.  I listen to it on my way to work because it puts me in a great frame of mind 
 Have them all now-- a complete set.  Liked the 'extras 
 This second Phantasm begins where the first one left off and takes you seven years later.  In real time it was nine years before they finally made this sequel.  That is why everyone looks more mature.  James Le Gros takes over as "Michael" for this film only.  But A. Michael Baldwin can be seen in flashbacks.  Reggie Bannister and the Tall Man Angus Scrimm are back and so are those deadly silver spheres.  I'll keep the plot a surprise for you, but this sequel is more big-budget.  They go all out for this one and is very enjoyable if you like suspense, horror and more gore.  If James Le Gros looks familar, tweleve years later after this film, he had a regular role in the tv series Ally McBeal in 2000-2001.  Funny sex scene.  Followed by PHANTASM III (1994), PHANTASM IV: OBLIVION (1998). A fifth film was to be written, but has not been given the green light 
 These pants are very stylish, made well, and cozy!  My only complaints with any drawstring pants during pregnancy is they have a tendancy to slide down throughout the day, thats my experience anyway, but it doesn't change my 5 star rating because I think its just inevitable that happens with drawstrings and pregnancy, and overall these pants are really great!  A little pricey, but worth it 
 Makes thin krumkaker the way a Norwegian likes them.! The ability to select color intensity is very nice - but you need to know what to look for! Too hot iron will bake thin batter faster than you expect. First time use, pay attention, but then you are set.  Very convenient, easy to clean. This iron has become my best friend, since I can serve delicious krumkaker in no time. Well worth the money 
 I got this frame as a gift for my parents after returning a different one.  The quality is good and it is easy to use.  The only thing I would improve is that there is no USB input so you need a card reader.  Overall I would recommend it to friends 
 The movie itself was pretty good, if only for the scenery of Mexico City. The movie was mostly shot there and captures the city perfectly in all of its glory and all of its horror. But the real thing to watch for on the DVD is the director's commentary. It's not one or two scenes, but the ENTIRE movie. I watched it twice for that reason. The director gives fantastic insight into making movies and particularly interesting were his stories about filming in one of the most dangerous cities in the world, including crew being kidnapped. A must watch. 
 Cellini's story reads better than a novel. He is the quintessential Renaissance man. In his service to popes, kings and a slew of dukes he was a goldsmith, painter, sculptor, soldier and he may have had more near death experiences than any other that I have ever read about. Of course, his tale leaves himself always and forever blameless in each conflict, betrayal or other unfortunate episode that he finds himself in, which is tremendously entertaining. At first, the reader is seduced into believing that this man has been wronged countless times by a world full of the most slippery types of people. By the middle of the book, however, it dawns on the reader that Cellini must have played some part in creating the misfortune and danger that he is constantly in.  	Cellini's writing evokes vivid images of the places and people that he meets. One of the most engrossing stories in the book is Cellini's imprisonment and later escape from the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, where he was confined by order of the Pope (who, according to Cellini, was bent on having him killed in order to prevent his own embarrasement). His escape from the place is a mix of (apparently) classic methods (he climbs down the side of the building using knotted bed sheets!) and terrible misfortune (he breaks his leg, is nearly killed, and is also attacked by mastiffs while crawling away for his life!). Very soon after having escaped the prison, though, he was again imprisoned by the Pope in a wretched and dank little cave in the Pope's own garden (where Cellini claims to have had mystical visions). 	Cellini has many other adventures in Italy and France (and on his journeys back and forth). Each tale is centered on how he creates his artworks in the service of some nobleman, how the nobleman is always astonished at the work, how Cellini is then betrayed by someone he was kind to (which, through no fault of his own, often puts him in the bad books of the patron). Cellini frequently ends up in a fight where he either wounds or kills the person, and then goes on his happy way. 	There is a great deal that one could say about this book and its author. It will suffice to state here that the book is a wonderful read, it offers excellent insights into life in the 16th century, and (as is true on my part) it makes the reader crave just half the adventure that this fellow has had 
 No doubt this will automatically be labeled as "liberal propaganda" by some but the issues tackled in this film should be of concern to everyone, Republican or Democrat.   I must admit that I didn't know much about contracting before this film came along, though I had heard bits and pieces before in the news about Dick Cheney's shady Halliburton dealings. "Iraq For Sale: The War Profiteers" truly opened my eyes to the horrendous waste and fraud that is going on in Iraq and the risks that contractors and our troops have been exposed to by companies who were found in some cases to value money more than human life. People might possess the misconception that this film takes a stance against the war and against private contracting in general, but that is absolutely not the case; rather it takes a stand against war PROFITEERING and tells the stories of those who have been personally affected by it. The interviews with family members whose loved ones died needlessly are truly heartbreaking, as is the moving testimony of a former Halliburton employee, Ben Carter, who discovered the company was providing contaminated water to soldiers.   I recommend that everyone show the film to friends, family and co-workers since Brave New Films counts on people and not theaters to distribute their movies. A definite must-see.

 When I first discovered The Onion two years ago, I literally woke up with sore abdominal muscles.  Not from too many situps, from laughing out loud so hard at the most finely tuned news satire to come along in decades.  "Our Dumb Century" features the Onion's classic satire newspapers for highlighted dates throughout the 20th century.  Headlines include (October 29, 1919) "Teddy Roosevelt Allows Three Others to be Carved into Mountain,"  (November 21, 1943) "Loose Lips Sink Ship," and (January 21, 1993) "New President Feels Nation's Pain, Breasts." (The same date has "Tipper Gore Jerks Arrhythmically at Inagural Ball.")  And that's just the headlines.  The articles take the concepts and run.  Not always even, not always hilarious, but there's something worth laughing out loud at on every page.  If you like to laugh, read The Onion 
 This novel immensely appealed to me.  The story flowed really well.  The word choice was excellent.  And it was an excellent insight about how women often fell.  The reality of the situation transcends time.  And who wouldn't want to break out of the motherly mode with a pirate.  The Frenchman was an awesome incarnation of the free spirit.  And yet her choice reflects the way true women weigh responsibility and selfish action.  This was excellent 
 Good reading.  The book has two themes.  One is the story about the inventor and his struggles to develop and market his new combine (harvester).  The other theme is the historic overview of mechanized agriculture and its impact on human life.  I read the book twice for a better understanding of the history 
 If you are busy in your business and the enjoyment of life is missing than this might very well be a resource for you. Take the time it takes to do something that is supportive so that you may have the time to be supported in the long run 
 Stephen Wright is an author whose time has come - FINALLY.  Although he's written three other exceptional novels before this one, he has, unfortunately (and shockingly), never received the accolades that he deserves and has deserved for so many years.  I can't imagine why this is.  Before I go any further with this review, I need to point out that Stephen was not only one of my writing instructors in my MFA program but also my thesis advisor and mentor.  I mention it because I want to talk about what I learned from him about writing and what I learned about him as a writer.  Likely, the most important thing he taught me was to choose my words thoughtfully and deliberately - a practice that is visibly apparent in all of his novels.  While I was reading The Amalgamation Polka, I found myself reciting random sentences out loud to anyone who would listen to me just because they were so cleverly and deliberately phrased.  I'm not joking.  His command of the English language is exceptional. I won't go into all of the plot specifics since many of the other reviewers have done so already but I will say that the level of skill, talent, and research effort required to complete this epic was monumental (from my fledgling perspective). One of the highest quality and smartest writers alive today, I've learned more from him than any other writer or teacher simply because a) He placed a high value on good, honest, thoughtful writing; b) He was generous enough to give straightforward, honest appraisals of our work (and he was always right on the mark with his criticisms); c) He assigned challenging authors to us to read (Cormac McCarthy, for example) for obvious reasons; and d) He absolutely has the goods to back up everything he teaches as is clear from reading any of his novels. (Any future success I earn as a writer will definitely be attributable to Stephen's influence).  That said, I urge anyone reading The Amalgamation Polka to read one of his other novels immediately:  Meditations in Green Going Native M31: A Family Romance  
 A creative, inspiring book that brings a smile to my face and motivation to reach my true potential.  I would recommend this book to anyone who ponders late at night if they are compromising great for good. 
 Indians have been gone from Masachusetts for so long now that their mere presence has fallen out of the public imagination (everywhere except in Massachusetts I suppose). This book brings you back to a time long before the "cowboys and Indians" era when the American West was won. A time when there were still very few English settlers in America, and Indians lived all the way to the East Coast beaches.  King Philip's war was the first major conflict between English settlers in America and the native Indians -- just one generation after the Pilgrim's landed at Plymouth. This book claims the war set the tone for all future conflicts with the Indians, right through the settling of the West.  The book is organized into three sections: a general summary of the war, a long (and tedious) retelling of the war over and over and over again as regional conflicts, and excerpts from three eye-witness diaries.  If you live in the Northeast or are an avid history buff looking for every minor detail of the conflict, the middle of the book will fascinate you. But if you don't live there, the second section becomes very tedious. The authors are trying to give history buffs locations of every battle and skirmish. But unless you care to follow the Mapquest-like directions, the retellings are pointless. Here's a sample, "However, once away from the canal, Robbins picked up the chase along Bournedale Road to Head of Bay Road, into Wareham on Red Brook Road, passing along Route 6 to Elm Street." There are paragraphs full of that stuff!  If this book contained just the first and last secton, I would have given it 5 stars. Part I is a 71 page summary of the entire war. Part III contains short, heavily redacted excerpts from three eye-witness accounts of the war. I would have liked to see more of this.  The book does go a little overboard trying not to be too harsh on the Indians, and pointing out the insensitivities of the English. Only in the diaries do you get a feel for just how savage the Indians could be. The rest of the book certainly points out how treacherous the English were.  All in all the book really is worth it if you're at all interested in King Philip's War 
 Not one for many words, but bottom line an excellent book.  Well written, and gives a very clear portrayal of DOwns' unit.  Men like him deserve the utmost respect.  And in my eyes he was a true hero 
 Dr. Hendrix is the creator of the imago model, which is more or less a breakthrough way for finding and solving various relationship problems. Thanks to it everyone can easily discover the very reasons for even the most serious problems that plague marriages and freeze love, respect and intimacy. I think that it ranks in importance with bestsellers such as lies at the alter and scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. One of the best things about getting the love you want is that it is directly applicable regardless of whether you want to get deeper understanding about yourself or a relationship. What makes it so valuable are the different tools that Dr. Hendrix has developed and used for a long time and are guaranteed to help you understand and solve many problems as well as to eliminate the underlying reasons. There are also examples which will calm you down especially if you think that your situation is very bad. Even if it is, this book provides 16 exercises which you can use right away together with your beloved one and start solving any problem right away. It is definitely one of the bestsellers, which I believe that every single and married person should have and often refer to 
 I found that this reading was extremely entertaining.  As the plot was uncovering I found myself actually wanting to read more and more.  This story has everything one could ask for in a book.  It has action, drama, romance, and even a little horror when your mind starts to wonder.  The one thing that attracted me to this book was the irony, and how Sophocles for-shadows it throughout the play. 	Sophocles was the head honcho of his time.  The things that he wrote were probably valued extremely high, maybe to the point of how Christians value the Bible.  His reasons for writing the things he did are probably beyond my point of logic, but as ignorant as I am, I can still apply the lessons of ancient Greece to modern day United States.  I feel that the main reason of him writing Oedipus Rex was to show how fate from the gods and choices from the humans work together.  For example, in the reading Oedipus is told his fate.  At an early age Oedipus leaves his homeland to make sure that his fate will not come true.  So Oedipus makes a few choices.  These choices ironically lead to his original fate.  So it seems like Sophocles is trying to show that the gods were completely in control, even if you tried to take it from them. 	While reading the play thoughts filled my head.  Thoughts such as if I were Oedipus would I have done anything differently.  After examining that scenario I decided that I would have probably done some of the same things as Oedipus did to try and run from his fate.  In no way am I sold out on the fact that we are all just little ants and God is making everything happen.  No matter what we do he has a preset ending for all of us.  I believe that God is in complete control but allows us to have the freedom of choice.  You can find this in the story.  The gods told Oedipus he would kill his father.  They knew it would happen so they gave Oedipus some freedom in the way he went about doing it.  The only difference is that I believe we can change our destiny.  	So was Sophocles right about the gods being in control, and no matter what we did it would still end up the same way?  Well, look around you.  Look at the world.  Notice the terrible things.  I do not believe God would destine such things as September 11th.  So it might have worked for Sophocles but I'm not him, I do have a choice.  The ironic thing is I believe Sophocles had one too, and he just chose to say no.  What do you choose? 
 This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.    As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.   
 I read this book in APES for a book review project.  It was very well written and very educational, however, the only topic of condors was in 4 paragraphs.  I recommend tihs book because it is very educational.  GO CONDOR 
 This is an excellent movie if you like war flicks. It made me angry being from the Vietnam generation also. It shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men. The acting from all the cast was top class. I highly recommend this movie. It may be slow at first, but the action later is amazing 
 I want to respectfully disagree with many of the reviewers here.  Yes, we miss Terry Kath - he can never be replaced, but there are a number of things about this album that make it a 5-star.  *  Donnie Dacus - give the guy credit.  He took on the most difficult challenge in rock history, and delivered.  I appreciate that he did not try to mimic Terry.  He played the music his way, and in so doing gave Chicago a different flavor.  I commend him and the band for letting him be himself (on stage, however, this was not such a positive thing!).  From the opening moments of Alive Again, it is clear this will still be a band with a guitarist.  Donnie's opening licks, and closing solo on Run Away (from Chicago 13) properly bookend his solid contributions to this middle, transitionary era in the band.  2.  Danny keeps his streak going.  I have surmised that Danny Seraphine took on something of a creative leadership role at this time.  More than ever, his drums seem to sing on this album.    3.  Fun.  Despite the tragedy of losing Terry, the boys are still having fun.  Take off your counter-culture/underground hats, sit back and enjoy!  4.  Listenable.  This is the first album in Chicago's history, that you can play for your girlfriend, that before was indifferent to them.  If I knew that someone didn't like Chicago, I would make sure this was the first album they heard, even before the Foster albums.  5.  It delivers the key elements of a good Chicago album.  It would be nice to hear a trombone or trumpet solo - but Walt's flute on Hot Streets makes up for that.  6.  Peter's liberation is evident.  You can hear his exuberance at finding his chops and you get the sense that a solo career is around the corner.  This is not good in every way - but the guy knows how to write hits with hooks.  (The thing about Cetera songs, is, you feel like you have heard them before - which to me is a great skill and talent).  So, how is this the beginning of a new Chicago era?  There are the obvious reasons:  Kath and Guercio are gone.  The band has more control over production, Donnie Dacus enters.  They are recording in Miami, not Caribou.  It is not a disco album, but it is informed by disco trends.  To me this is not a sellout.  It shows that they can adapt and are curious about what they can do with any style of music.  But please - Alive Again is not a disco song.  120 beats per minute are not an important element.  The album cover was unwise - they look kinda goofy, when we needed them to look more serious and "cool".  Interesting observation is that Peter and Danny, the next of the originals to leave, are embracing on the cover.  Chicago proves that they are more than their members.  Chicago is a sound, an idea, a concept, that can outlive tragedy and personnel changes.  For this reason, and the fact that I can play it for people that don't think they like Chicago, I give it 5-stars.  Yes - buy this album 
 The third edition of the Textbook of Natural Medicine is an extraordinary accomplishment.  This will be seen as the moment when natural medicine truly took its place at the forefront of modern healthcare.    Under the stewardship of Michael Murray and Joe Pizzorno, this edition provides guidance for practitioners and laypersons alike in the application of natural interventions in treating all manner of diseases and afflictions.  As a naturopathic practitioner, I owe a debt of gratitude to Murray and Pizzorno, and to all of the contributors to this wonderful text. Such loving attention to the art and science of natural medicine must not go unrecognised.  Some have critcised previous editions for a lack of scientific rigour.  If one is to refer to conventional medical texts from only a generation ago, they will find significant errors and outrageous claims.  For a system of medicine with little-to-no corporate or government funding, naturopathy has performed extraordinarily well to achieve its current position - where the science exists, we detail it.

 "On the Big Rock Candy Mountain Where the cops have wooden legs,  And the handouts grow on bushes, And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs,  Where the bulldogs all have rubber teeth And the cinder dicks are blind  I am a gonna go Where there ain't no snow  Where the rain don't fall And the wind don't blow On the Big Rock Candy Mountain"  Wallace Stegner is such a great storyteller and I love his writing so much that before the year has ended I will have most all of his book in my library. Mr. Stegner delves so deeply into the characters of this book, enabling us to feel their inner wounds and emotions as well as their determination to fight all challenges for the betterment of their nomadic life. We become close to Bo Mason who is the chief character along with his wife Elsa, Bruce and Chet. Stegner shows the length a husband will go to acquire comfort and food for his family.  The way a man would go so close to death's door all for his family's sake. There is a lot of love shown in this story , but there also is a lot of bitterness, self pity, ruthlessness, anger and illness. It is all about the human condition and what we yearn for that is sometime so hard to come by and so far away.  Stegner fans will not be disappointed by this book.

 From riding helicopters to braving seasickness in a state of the art computer-controlled yacht, Michael Lewis gives us an insight into the mind of one James H. Clark - founder of Silicon Graphics, Netscape and Healtheon.  Unlike other tech moguls, Jim Clark is more innovator than businessman as he never sticks around quite long enough to reap the results of his foresight. Though his startups have made him a very rich man, it is the businessman who ends up running the company that has always reaped more (Wozniak vis-a-vis Jobs, Allen vis-a-vis Gates).  In retrospect Clark's attempt to induce an inflection point onto the old economy was a good one no matter how short lived. To this day, marketing people have always had their way with engineers. In reality, engineering genius may not always scale well in the market economy.  As always, Lewis' free flowing narrative is very successful in painting quite a complete picture not only of Clark but of the New Economy as well. This author has the knack for providing the reader insights not only on the subject itself but extends it to a far broader social context. Indeed, any subject that perks up this author's interests may it be baseball or Wall Street has always been a worthwhile read. 
 I bought this book and have been working my way through the content. It would be fair/accurate to note that I am not a 'technical geek' in any sense of the word. I have been using Macs for 20 years and make a living doing photo retouching and restoration.  This AppleScript book is, quite frankly, one of the best 'computer' books I've ever read. And while it is not my intention to switch careers I am pleased that I can finally get a handle on AppleScript for things like file management, general work flows, etc.  The author deserves a huge 'thank you' for the great effort and time that he put into this book as well as the contributions he makes on the various AppleScript venues around the web. He's always helpful to us newbies trying to learn this scripting language for real world work solutions.  Definitely a 'highly recommended' from my end 
 I have to be honest. This was a well written story with characters that you grow to know very well. It is enjoyable. My problem started when Malcom Stapelton stepped out of the role of a fictional character and became Robert Rogers of Rogers Rangers. To me good historical fiction gives the real historical figures their due along with some help from the fictional heros. I would still recommend it to anyone who is interested in pre-revolutionary fiction 
 This book was written in simple language, so it's easy to read.  It is full of support from Bible verses and outside sources (archaeology, famous quotes, etc.).  Paul E. Little is reminiscent of C.S. Lewis because both of them show that you don't have sacrifice science and rationality for Christianity.  I've read a couple other apologetics books (The Case for Christ and Basic Christianity), and they don't come close 
 My family had this album in the house when I was a kid, so I knew most of these songs by heart when I was about 8 years old.  Recently I saw the film on TV, and when I heard "Bali Ha'i", I knew I had to get this CD.  This is one of the best soundtracks that I have ever heard, equalled only by, perhaps, "West Side Story".  "Bali Ha'i" is my favorite.  It works on me like magic, still evoking the mysterious wonder surrounding that "special island".  In fact, the movie, with all of its colorful effects, plays in my head when I hear these songs.  There are the fun numbers like "Bloody Mary" and "There Is Nothin' Like A Dame".  The ballads "Some Enchanted Evening", "Younger Than Springtime" and "This Nearly Was Mine" are all that one could want in a romantic song.  And Mitzi Gaynor's big moments - "Cockeyed Optimist", "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair" and "I'm In Love With A Wonderful Guy" - are pure joy.  She conveys the hopeful naivete' of the 50's to perfection.  "Dites-Moi" is a treat for me because, guess what?  Je comprends le francais!  But you don't have to speak French to appreciate this album.  These songs have universal appeal with interesting, recognizable melodies, fun to sing along with.  The remastered sound gives the orchestral arrangements (Ah, those soaring strings!) a new clarity that I could not have appreciated when I was much younger.  The entire CD sounds fantastic, so if you like this movie, you will love the soundtrack. 
 This is a great little gem to keep around 'in case of emergency'.  Lots of great little tips that help with tasks all year round.  When things start piling up, I always turn to this book for help 
 These lectures are a boon to anyone interested in having a go at understanding both the micro and macro of our universe and what part we have in the scheme of it all. Feynman is both the essence of clarity and he provides the tools for scientific thought about the origin of the universe 
 I loved the setting of this movie; it was out in the country with peaceful nature sounds I enjoy hearing. The pace was relaxed but not dull at all. The plot was sweet, the acting well done. Reese Witherspoon demonstrated her talent in this movie, her first major role. 
 I never tire of this record.  For me it's like home.  I still get goose bumps upon hearing "Every Little Bit", or "You Never Get What You Want", and I wonder each time what Patty Griffin's process is.  How does she do it?  How does she cut so close to the emotional bone and still produce something so beautiful?  We may never know, and really who cares?  If her process creates masterpieces like this, certainly we all benefit.  Patty Griffin is a true storyteller with musical capabilities far beyond those who are lucky enough (but less talented) to sell millions.  I tell everyone about this record.  Don't hesitate to buy this-you will thank me 1000 times. 
 Remember the old fifties TV show, "You Are There" which recreated as accurately as possible the great moments in history as if they were happening as you watched?  "You are there..."  That's what this book is...a recreation, as historically accurate as possible, of Jesus' last day on earth as a human with scripture interwoven into the events of the day as it happened and as it went along. At times moving, very moving...  Fundamentalists looking for aura and glory will not find it here. Instead, readers will find a carefully written account of life in the Palestine of that day and, as carefully as can be researched, the reactions, thoughts, hopes, fears and dreams of the the Apostles, Priests and Roman officers as they lived that day, not knowing what it was, where it would lead or what it was all about.  A very, very, very good effort.  While there is no groundbreaking theology here--there was never intended to be any--the reader can learn a lot about ancient Palestine and come to a greater and deeper understanding and appreciation of life in Jesus' time...For example, few would know or imagine that the Jews were doing brain surgery in this time, removing cataracts, too. False teeth and dental work were common.  It was all part of Jesus' world, a world we never think about or comprehend.  What we learn about his world alone is worth the read.  And for Christians, it adds a richness and fullness to the age-old story 
 Absolutely one of the funniest and engaging books about child care and SAHM's. I think this book makes a lot of true points, about gender and about the unrecognized value of a homemaker

 I remember when my uncle - himself a jazz radio announcer - decided to let go of his LPs, and called me to come up to New York to get them. He had at least a thousand. I buried myself with them, and he watched as I threw aside the ones I already had or didn't think looked cool. After putting aside the Johhny Smith LP that makes up one-half of this CD, he stopped me. "Are you nuts?" I can still hear him saying, and he was a musician, also, "This is one of the best guitar players out there!" Here was a square looking guy with a crewcut, and the LP cover was nothing to write home about, but my uncle Sterling knew his jazz so I took it to humor him. Man, was I in for a suprise. The sound alone (he had a guitar named after him) was killer, and the licks seemed effortless. "Out Of Nowhere", and "Some Of These Days" knocked me out.  Still not as well known as many lesser players, Smith never plays a superfluous note. He is a consummate pro. I haven't heard the second LP on this CD, so 4 stars, now 
 During his very long and distinguished life (97 years), Bertrand Russell produced some the very finest books ever published, and this is one of them. It is not only concise, temperate, and modest, but very easy for the lay person. Quoting from the Bible or the Gospels, or stating well known facts in recorded history, or simply using old fashioned common sense, the great man simply answers simple questions with reason, facts, and thoughtfulness. Does he believe in a supernatural being in the sky? Hardly! More's the pity that more do not read Russell, and similar books! 
 "The Serial Killer Files: The Who, What, Where, How, and Why of the World's Most Terrifying Murderers," Harold Schechter, New York, Ballantine Books, 2003  ISBN 0-345-46566-0 (ppk) is by an established author of 10 prior books, 7 on serial killers.      The book's 402 pages of text are conveniently divided into 9 chapters plus 7 pages listing a rather thorough true-crime bibliography for about 100 individual cases, mostly SK-loners but perhaps 10% SK-couples or "family".      If this book is read cover-to-cover the reader encounters moderate redundancy -- but this is a literary devise seemingly required for the book's division into chapters which nicely explore all those elements of the lengthy sub-title (who, what, where, how and why) plus intriguing chapters on sadism, extreme perversions as cannibalism, methodology, profiling, and an exceptionally spirited coverage of SK culture.      This book is a treatise with cross-referencing of "everything you ever wanted to know about serial killers,"  with  lots of  gruesome details on lust-killers, torture, etc.  Were one to choose a single book on SK, this one by Schechter stands out, and the price is right. The only technical error I noted was the name of the acids hydrochloric vs sulfuric  (HCl page 265, and H2SO4 page 334) used by J. G. Haigh, the "Acid-Bath Killer" 
 Absolutely brilliant! This is a live recording taken from three stage concerts the Python's performed at the Hollywood Bowl and contains some of their best work from the popular TV series. All the favourites are here,  the Nudge Nudge sketch, Ministry of Silly Walks, etc. These sketches are  all performed in a much better way than in the original series, and there's  even some new material with Graham Chapman's 'One Man Wrestling' routine.  If you can stand the shouts of alcohol induced audience, this is a treat  for all Pythonites 
 If you are interested in history, especially WWII and the beginning of the cold war, this is a great read.  The author gives voice to the many unsung heroes of the Berlin Airlift, and chronicles in a remarkable way each of those who died in the endeavor.  Gere provides a fascinating  insight into the politics of the time and the personal stories of those who helped alter the course of history. The author, who flew in the airlift, is too modest and leaves out his own story.  Still, a great piece of history 
 Gary Nash's _The Forgotten Fifth: African Americans in the Age of Revolution_ is an excellent introduction to early U.S. history, particularly the Revolutionary Period, from an African American perspective.  What becomes clear from his study is that American history and the story of the nation's founders cannot be understood without a thorough examination of the lives and contributions of African Americans.      Much of the groundwork for these lectures is contained in Nash's 1991 work, _Race and Revolution_, which is an excellent companion to this work because it excerpts the writings and petitions of the black founding fathers: people like Richard Allen, Benjamin Banneker, Prince Hall, and James Forten.   Nash reminds readers of an important fact: African Americans were actively involved in the debates of the Revolutionary Period and in the military action as well, fighting on both the American and the British side.  In terms of the military involvement, white and black soldiers fought side-by-side in integrated units in the Revolutionary War, a phenonemon which would not re-occur until the Korean War, nearly two hundred years later.     The first chapter "The Black Americans' Revolution" discusses African Americans' participation in the Revolutionary War, a subject that is generally not widely known in the United States.  Nash describes the large flight of slaves and freemen to the British-side who offered emancipation in 1775 through Lord Dunmore's Emancipation Proclamation.  In contrast, the American forces offered freedom in exchange for one year of military service.  For the colonials, wide-spread emancipation was never offered despite the enlightenment rhetoric expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in state constitutions.   Nash begins chapter one by crediting previous historians and, in particular, William C. Nell, whose _Colored Patriots of the American Revolution_ (1855) was the first historical account of black soldiers fighting for the Americans.  Nash discusses how Nell, a black school teacher in Boston, focused exclusively on black patriots, de-emphasizing black participation on the British side.  The emphasis of Nell's history advanced a political argument for black citizenship and rights in the 1850s, during a period when rights were being retracted in the North.     Chapter two "Could Slavery Have Been Abolished?" looks closely at the contradiction between the Declaration of Independence, with its statements about unalienable rights, and the Constitution, which inscribed legal slavery.  Nash makes a convincing case that there was an opportunity for abolition at the beginning of the Republic, which was later sacrificed to short term political interests reflecting the North and Mid-Atlantic states' lack of conviction.  Nash criticizes the trend among professional U.S. historians to apologize for the founding fathers' inaction on abolition--the view that historical circumstances did not permit abolition at this time.  Nash offers insights about the conflicted views and attitudes of Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, John Adams, James Madison, and Thomas Jefferson on slavery.     The third chapter discusses citizenship and the hardening of racial codes in the 1800s.  African Americans' rights and freedoms in the North and Mid-Atlantic states were being curtailed by legislation barring blacks' participation in civic life and foreclosing economic opportunities.  Much of the chapter contrasts the views of two Philadelphians:  James Forten, a black patriot of the Revolutionary War, and Tench Coxe, a white politician who published pamphlets on race in American in the 1810s and 1820s.  Nash threads the discussion of Forten's and Coxe's views throughout the chapter in order to discuss black and white views on race and citizenship in the early 1800s.       A final comment is that this book is very readable in a way that academically-oriented histories often are not.  Nash is a diligent scholar and a strong writer with a gift for brevity.   As a result, the book can be enjoyed in a few sittings, yielding rewards well worth a reader's time.  The footnotes lead in many different directions, and point out new areas of interest for amateur and professional historian alike.  There is a wealth of knowledge in this short book.    _The Forgotten Fifth_ can be read profitably by high school, college, and graduate students.  It is an important study that will enrich and deepen one's understanding of American history.     
 Considering all that's happening in Afghanistan today, this is a timely and fascinating story of an American who travled there in the early 1800's.   Fast paced book that's hard to put down and it gives a glimpse into early 1800's life in a country that most people still don't understand today.  
 I found the advice on the home office section especially practical and useful. This book has a lot of energy and it inspired my decision-making and creative decluttering. I took some of their ideas and used others as a springboard for my own. Now I need a book on how to organize my diet, so that will work as well .. 
 This is a genre we love here.  I prefer the pageantry and lavish sets of the aristocracy era flicks but daughter prefers the soot and smoke of this down to earth tale.  This one walks you smack into the early industrial revolution from a gentle, settled country parsonage life among the middle class of that era.  Noisy, smoky, full of the images of stark poverty and despair and yet tipped rightside up by those who fought their way through it and found success.  The theme of girl mistakes good guy for bad is all too familiar in this genre yet it is far more painful for some reason in this setting for me and I think is carried on a bit too long.  It poses challenges I found difficult to rationalize even for the era.  My daughter however loved it and perhaps the younger generation can identify with this type of struggle more than the posh and pageantry. A very captivating tale all in all and will keep you interested 
 this magazine is sweet it features tons of eye candy, being plants and hot girls and buds, lots of great tips, tricks and info on the culture around pot 
 Ray Kurzweil brings us a fun and fascinating diet with aspect of this book is that it provides a look into the progression of medical research and technology and the amazing possibilities that await us in the not-so-distant future. Grossman and Kurzweil are not speculative visionaries, but have based their projections, including the end of aging and chronic illness, on compelling medical research that has already been done or is currently underway. This book is a fascinating, human, health-based account leading up to the eventual fusion of human life and technology This book is a well written, thoroughly researched presentation of where modern medicine stands now and the exciting directions in which it is headed.

 I really liked this book. It had a romantic appeal and vivid, memorable characters. The plot was also fantastic. Wilkie wrapped up everything quite nicely at the end--I won't say anymore for those who haven't read it. I didn't feel there were any unbelievable coincidences in the plot. It was a little slow at first, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Some parts were hilarious. This book has it all. I would definitely recommend it. 
 I finished this book with a sigh of regret that such a totally absorbing story had to end.  It was so real, so vividly and beautifully written.  A true gem by a marvelous writer.  And what a story.  At first I felt the mother's story was intrusive, then I, like the heroine, began to look forward to more about the "book within a book".  The tales were beautifully woven together and I was on pins and needles for the whole of the book hoping for the ending that finally resulted.  I will read ALL of Ms. Richards' books.  This was a wonderful reading experience 
 I gave this as a gift for my Aunt and Uncle who celebrated their 60th birthdays. They said they really loved it 
 This book is a great reference book, and also a great read.  I read every page of the book and created a careful outline of it (which will be available at davidritsema.com).  The book was required for my doctoral program in NT and I found it be very helpful in providing the panoramic view of biblical backgrounds to the NT 
 In my years of selling I have taken sales courses and have read many sales management books. Most have spoken on things like features and benefits, or how to close the sale. Others have given me tips on scheduling my time. Merrill's book has brought to light an issue all sales people need to understand, that is, what is important to the buyer. Seldom does the average salesperson understand what it takes to be on the other side of the desk. This book has a great deal of insight into the analysis that a buyer goes through to maintain their assortment. My advice is to take this book and understand the process the buyer will be going through prior to making your next presentation 
 This is the one!  I just love this little spiral book with knit techniques explained and well illustrated.  Being a beginner, I especially appreciated that the book can open with the purl stitch and knit stitch pages situated side-by-side...FINALLY got the difference!!  I'd give this book SIX stars if I could! 
 Like others, I wondered at the number of people who slammed this book, which I found to be gripping, enjoyable, and in places hard to read for all the right reasons.  The answer is simple: this book is not written for the armchair adventurer, for someone who will watch the Discovery Channel but never actually go to any of those places they'll see on the screen.  It tells some hard truths, and I can easily understand why those who bought the book hoping to be entertained by someone else's tragedy would be greatly disappointed.  If, however, you've ever been closer to real adventure than picturing yourself in an SUV ad, I have a feeling this book will work for you.  It is not a fun book.  No book with a tragedy at its center should be fun or light reading, really.  But it is fascinating, compelling, a page-turner.  It is highly educational, particularly for those who are inclined to view adventure athletes as brain-dead adrenaline junkies.  By taking the reader through the expedition members' hard work and preparation, the hassles and hardships they endured, the book forces us to see them as being in many ways the antithesis of the stereotype: they are patient, painstaking, and thorough.    The bottom line is that this book isn't the literary equivalent of America's Most Death-Defying Videos.  It's not written to titillate the folks back home.  It seeks to tell the truth about a pursuit that many people find simply incomprehensible.  If read with an open mind and without an expectation of being thrilled by death-defying feats, I think it will give the reader that understanding.  
 I purchased this player because of the CNET review. This is an amazing device. I'm so impressed. It has powerful sound effects and plays OGGs as well. The drag and drop function is really user friendly. I also like JetAudio software. This player is highly recommended 
 Before this book the word lady symbolized a New England society debutant in a courtsy at her debut. It seemed restrictive but this book offers a more expanded and actually quite inspiring interpretation... being a lady does include stating your mind, having a leadership role, enjoying adventure, and so forth. It's like an etiquette coach once said - class does not equal cash. Ladies can be strong, wise, outspoken, but at its core ... it is about having self-respect and learning from our mistakes with grace 
 I hadn't seen this movie in 10 years until this past weekend when it resurfaced on TV -- whew!!! what a welcomed blast from the past.  Martin Lawrence was still in his heyday as a comedian in this movie's 1996 release.    A sober Bobby Brown delivers an entertaining performance as Martin's pseudo sidekick, Regina King plays a believable "it girl" role and Lynn Whitfield totally delivers an Oscar nomination-worthy performance as a woman scorned and determined to make her man pay for all the heartache that comes from lies and deception.  This is one of those twist-of-fate movies for playaz who manipulate relationships just to "get some" and move on.  The story is easy to follow.  There's tons of subtle but gutbustingly funny scenes.  The movie moves along at a great pace -- you won't go to sleep on this!  For anyone -- male or female -- who's ever had an "adventure in dating" with a nut you later question why you ever dated, this movie's for you.  As the movie's theme song says, "The sweetest woman in the world could (also) be the meanest woman in the world/Did you make her that way?"  You're just gonna have to watch this movie to "get it. 
 I have never bought Hawaiian music before, having very little exposure to it, but when I first heard Mark Keali'i's voice, from the movie "Lilo & Stitch", I had to see if he had an album of his own.  When I found this album I bought it not knowing what to expect.  What a wonderful album!  His voice is amazing and the chanting is captivating.  I will be buying his other album too.  I also hope to find other artists of this calibur.  To discover a whole new culture in music is very exciting 
 I already reviewed the non-import version of this...but they're the same album. The only difference is that this one comes with the OBI strip (that paper thing on the left side with kanji). They have the same tracks, but this one seems to be easier to get than the regular one. Either way, I'll just paste the review I already did for the other just in case you come accross this one instead:    That's what I ask myself everytime I get one of his albums. The guy's constantly working on music and seemingly never takes a break. I've yet to be disappointed by anything he does, and this is no exception. I Need 5 Minutes Alone is weird compared to BucketHead's other albums though. It doesn't really fit in to any category of music. Monsters & Robots was more rock, Colma was acousitc, BucketHeadLand was friggin' nuts, Day of the Robot was metal/ambient/awesome, etc. But I have no idea how to describe this album.    But that isn't a bad thing, as I Need 5 Minutes Alone has some of BucketHead's finest material. I know I constantly say that about his albums (you should see a pattern in them by now), but some tracks on here are just insane with how perfectly executed they are. Dispite some tracks already being on other albums, a few of them came out first on here, so it doesn't really matter. Plus it's cool to hear Buck...I mean Herbie...sing. And that's what we stat out with- Herbie ordering chicken at McDonalds. Then it goes into a little drum/keyboard bit that leads to what I think is either bass or heavily distorted guitar. I don't use effects when making music, so I can't tell (unprofessional, I know). I must say, for just BucketHead and Brain doing this album, it's surprising how well it can stand out. Some tracks are long but not boring, as they keep building up to just this huge explosion of perfection.    There are quite a few stand out tracks here:     -Pieces   -Danyel (a song about a porn actress believe it or not)   -8 Diagram Pole Fighter (this is a very cool and creepy track. Play this when Sally's running from LeatherFace in the first TCM and see how well it fits the situation)   -Carl Junghole   -Twice With The Sledge   -Hazelnut Cream Pie (very bluesish)   -Slapatron   -General Butterfly (beautiful lyrics, and the music in the back is an early rendition of the "Colma" track on the album of the same name)    And I have to say that "Twice With The Sledge" is the single most beautiful BucketHead track...no...anything I've ever heard. Nothing I've heard can compare to it. Even things on Colma can't match this baby. It's purely acoustic and has a sad tone to it while still being a fast track in some places.    But who am I to say all of this? If you're a BucketHead fan, you'll buy this without needing a reason to. Let's be honest though, if you pay $30+ for it, you're getting ripped off. You can easily find this on certain sites *coughBarnes&Noblecough*, and they have it in stock. In fact, that's where I got my new copy just last year after my first one wore out. The cd booklet's art is pretty cool too. I absolutely love the picture of BucketHead walking down the hall with Brain following in the distance. And you actually get all the lyrics too.    I can never say it enough- Thank you BucketHead, for being such an inspiration for me. You are the reason I play music. Granted, I'll never be up to your status, but I won't stop. Thanks for constantly giving me inspiration 
 I loved this book.  Å rich and unique blend of Chinese myth, contemporary fantasy, science fiction, and police procedural with complex, interesting characters and a good pace as well as a dash of quirky humor.  Detective Inspector Chen has a strained relationship with his Goddess, loves his wife, and isn't entirely thrilled with his job as investigator of cases that lie between Earth, Heaven, and Hell when he's faced with the matter of a dead young girl whose soul hasn't made it to Heaven.  Soon he is sucked into a plot that goes beyond the mere white-slavery of dead girls and into the tangled, demonic ambitions of Hell's most evil bueraucrats whose machinations may be played out on the unsuspecting populations of the living on Earth.    A brilliant read and fun every step of the way--I couldn't put it down.  My only complaints:  too short and the ending was a bit slap-dash-bang-you're-done!  Interestingly, although many of the themes are complex and adult, there is very little "bad" language and no actual sex--though prostitution and sexual deviance are important elements in the plot development.  I'm looking forward to the next one and I'll be recommending it to everyone I can think of 
 In "Night Soldiers" Alan Furst has created a masterpiece of tension and fear set during the interwar years of Europe.  This novel, his first, centers on a ring of spies recruited from states trapped within the expanding Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe.  The main character, Khristo Stoianev, a Bulgarian eventually travels to fight in the Spanish Civil War, and then turns on his communist spy masters as he becomes disillusioned with both the fascist and communist movements.  One of the books classic moments comes during the education of Stoianev at the hands of his NKVD handlers in Russia during a chess game.  I won't spoil the episode, but Furst does an excellent job of using the game as a means of showing the ruthless nature of Soviet (and perhaps all) espionage.  "Night Soldier" introduces several characters who make appearances throughout Furst's other excellent spy novels set in the same period of time and general geographical local.  Because of this fact, I highly recommend reading this novel first, although those that follow can typically be read in any particular order (the exception being the stories involving Jean Casson - World at Night and Red Gold).  What makes Furst's loosely structured series so compelling is that 1; they are very well researched and historical very accurate, especially with regard to spy craft - as I understand it through academic experience only. 2; the characters are extremely flawed, very believable and interesting to empathize with - all of the characters and their adventures provoke much thought. 3; the novels do not attempt to achieve a false sense of conclusion at their end - they always allow the reader to decide for him/herself what happens, and they rarely resolve the feeling of tension that pervades Furst's works. 4; the secondary characters are always very well developed and much more interesting than their sometimes small roles would have the reader believe- so one is always off balance (who will live, who will die - who can be trusted, who cannot?). 5; Furst does an excellent job of setting the atmosphere of terror that resulted from the conflict between fascism and stalinism during the secret wars preceding the outbreak of the Second World War.  For these reasons and more, I cannot more highly recommend "Night Soldiers" and Alan Furst's other novels to the spy-thriller enthusiast.  Purchase this book, find a quiet evening to read, and enjoy. 
 Isak Dinesen is one of my favorite authors and one of the books contained in this volume, "Shadows on the Grass" is my favorite book of hers.  I must confess that I think as a fully realized piece of literature, "Out of Africa" (making this collection of the two a real bargain) and for trademark decadent splender, "Seven Gothic Tales" is better, but I like this one for one story and one in particular which seems to merge both elements. This is "A Letter from A King" in which Dinesen recalls a lion hunt which she and Denys went on. Upon shooting a rather large lion she had it skinned and sent to the king. His majesty Christian X sent her a warm letter of thanks which she in turn used as a king of magic totem with the natives who worked on her coffee farm.  The story contains far more elements than just that. I also must confess that when I first encountered this work of literature it was in the course of watching a film at the Karen Blixen house in Denmark where I watched as the author told to the story during the course of the film.  The other stories in this book are excellent as well. I recommend this book as well as all of the other books that Isak Dinesen wrote, they are all wonderful 
 Part of the appeal of Burke's Robicheaux books is watching the king-of-self-destruction self-destruct even further.  And Robicheaux doesn't let us down here either, in this gripping thriller, dragging everybody down with him as he goes through his self-inflicted agonies.  But, of course, we all know that he will redeem himself in the end.  Other reviewers have pointed out the counterpoint between Burke's poetic descriptions and the gritty sleazy world in which the book is set.  Also, another reviewer accurately notes that in this book, it's the trip, not the destination, that will thrill the reader.  I couldn't put it down.  Burke and Robicheaux are irrestible.  May they both enjoy good health for years to come 
 This book was sort of like a kid's look into the world... where there are thieves and people who try to do illegal things to gain a profit. Some people learn, some people don't, and some people witness these things and know that's not who they want to be.   That's what Jenna Boller does. She watches everything around her, and she learns from it. And when the time comes when she has to deal with it she knows she's not alone. This is such a good book.  
 Beware. If you have a slightly twisted sense of humour, reading this book could make you seriously addicted to Mr. Dick. It was the first of his I read, and I ended up befriending a second-hand book dealer just to get hold of some of his rarer books. Sad but true. You have been warned 
 Really, this pillow is perfect in every way.  I have had neck pain so long i lost track. I found this on amazon, ordered 2 and what a great idea. If you have any type of neck pain YOU NEED THIS PILLOW 
 This book plainly states the path to rejuvenation of African people...return to the way, our way...meaning return to African culture which gives African people strength...the strength that allowed us to create kingdoms and full fledged civilizations, intellectual centers before Europe existed.  The first page brought tears to my eyes.  I read this book every day as if I was married to it.  It will resurrect you with its imagery and rejuvenate your spirit...and simply reconnect you with your African self.  It is poetry, it is music...it is drums beating inside your soul.  Read this book, and buy it for all of your friends 
 I just had a few comments on this book. I cover a lot of ground in this review, ranging from depth psychology to neurobiology, so I apologize in advance for that, but most of it is relevant to the discussion of dreams and the brain.  While I like Jung and am very familiar with his ideas, and notwithstanding the fact that he has faired better than Freud as far as his long-term reputation goes in recent decades (and he's certainly a better authority than most to cite here), he still has that fascination with dreams which he and many depth psychologists of the day inherited from the 19th century European mystical and early psychological tradition.  Unfortunately, in contrast to previous decades (especially the pre-60s era) where Freudian therapists were all the rage and were portrayed in films like Mirage (which starred Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman) and Psycho as heros engaged in life or death battles with the dark forces of the subconscious, psychotherapy and psychoanalytic theory has not faired that well scientifically in recent decades, and the obsession with dreams is another aspect of their focus which hasn't worked out very well, either.  So, while I certainly respect and admire many of the early psychologists, and they were great pioneers in many ways, and some of their ideas are still important, nevertheless, a lot of what they said has to be taken now with a considerable grain of salt. It doesn't mean that dreams are completely valueless, but they're of much less significance than has been claimed in the past.   However, the most serious critique of the psycholanalytic (and others) view of dreams comes from recent research into the brain and neurobiology. The problem is that dreams are really not what people think at all most of the time--which is some sort of cyptic but profound message from the unconscious mind.   For example, consider the question of why most dreams seem to consist of collections or sequences of difficult to interpret images, thoughts, and memories that seem to be combined or strung together in a not very logical and difficult to interpret fashion. The reason why, contrary to the popular belief that this reflects some profound and not easily discernible meaning, is that the order really is almost random, or is governed by very weak associational processes. The reason why this is, and why most dreams seem so puzzling and difficult to understand is that when you go to sleep, the memory areas of the brain located in the temporal cortex become more active through a process known as corticocipedal disinhibition, allowing memories, images, and thoughts to flood into consciousness willy-nilly. This is prevented or inhibited during normal waking, otherwise the flood of thoughts and images would interfere with normal memory retrieval and thinking processes.  This explanation wasn't understood until about 30 years ago and comes from important research into the neurobiology of dreaming and consciousness. Most people, though, still have these old, pre-scientific notions that they have some sort of profound significance. If you're under a lot of stress, such as on the job, or whatever, and you dream that your boss just fired you, okay, that's different. Obviously the dream has some relation to reality (which in this case shouldn't be that hard to figure out).  But most of the time the dream will be something like the following: boss calls you into his or her office and tells you to fly away with him in a great, golden chariot with six magical, flying, white horses on a secret mission into the future, or the past, or whatever. So you do. At that point you wake up and think to yourself, "What the hell did that mean? I don't know but it must be something very profound. It must mean my boss really likes me after all, and that I'm destined to do great things on the job since we flew off together into the sunset in this great chariot drawn by six flying, white horses."  Unfortunately, the simple fact is that the dream doesn't really mean anything. It means you had a dream that used as its point of departure your boss or job, since that's what's currently on your mind, but after that, the free-associational flow of dream images and thoughts took over and produced the usual semi-nonsensical concatenation of dream images and thoughts.  I realize this explanation won't appeal to many people, but as someone wiser than I once said, "God is a mathematician, and so the universe works according to physical and biological laws, rather than as mystics, poets, lovers, romantics, and New Agers (and adherents of other touch-feely philosophies and beliefs), would have liked."  Despite that, I give the book five stars in recognition of Jung's tremendous historical importance to the field of psychology, especially his work in archetypes which has influenced countless of other writers and thinkers such as Joseph Campbell.  
 I never really could understand why most people tend to think that Darkman is better than Nightbreed. Because it really is'nt.  Nightbreed is truly a masterpiece. One of Elfman's best, and certainly woth every penny. Take my  advice: Bye it 
 A remarkable book that clearly elucidates the remaking of the world economies in our own capitalistic image. As a result, the elitist establishment possess these countries and their leaders by simply pulling the plug on any of their artificial economies, which in turn leads to a collapse of their fragile economic system and their total impoverishment. That paves the way to the image makers/vultures to offer them financial help (loans, etc) and as a result owning them for a tawdry price.  The consequence of globalization and artificially reshaping people in our own image can be deadly most of the times for the clones but definitely profitable for the corporate leaders/politicians. That's true capitalism. Everything is for sale!  This book is fascinating and illuminating. It is a must read for every concerned citizen about the world and the globalization process. 
 I really enjoyed the book.  I found that the book was explained in logical sequence with plenty of background information as to why you will use one oil over another depending on what your desire is.  The book is not one where you can flip through it and AH! there's the recipe I want.  You will need to read and understand what Donna Maria is trying to teach you first and then mix up your own concoction.  However, she does include many of her own favorites.  Otherwise, read the book and then pick your ingredients from each of the list (similar to ordering from a chinese restaurant) and chances are, you will have a nice product. I would write down your ingredients while you are making the product, because it will probably come up quite well and you will have to sell it 
 This is a good read.  But I recomment "to pray as a Jew" and "to be a jew". This book is a good resource.  I dont think it really speaks to the reader very well 
 I just finished Jonathan Eig's book "Opening Day", and loved it. Like his earlier work "Luckiest Man", Eig sticks to facts and historical sources (interviews [old and new], newspaper sources) and is able to separate some of the myths surrounding Jackie Robinson and the 1947 season from the truth. For example, the story about Pee Wee Reese draping his arm around Robinson's shoulder in Cincinnati in 1947. Great story, but not much fact supporting whether it happened.  Eig reports the known sources and lets the reader decide whether to believe the facts or the myth (in this case, I like the myth!).  This is the first book that I know of that chronicles the 1947 season (w/some "flashbacks", which are necessary to understand some of the people and the culture and thought of the time).  Eig's writing style keeps the reader interested, as Robinson joins the Dodgers after a year with the minor league Montreal Royals, proceeds to take the field and ultimately become Major League Rookie of the Year - there was only one for both leagues at the time.  Interviews with Rachel Robinson, Jackie's wife, show both the courage Robinson shows, as well as the emotional turmoil, as Robinson had promised Branch Rickey that he would not fight his tormentors.  As the season progresses, Eig does a great job of how Robinson's Dodger teammates loosen up to him, believing that his playing as a ballplayer is more important than skin color. By the end of the season, Ralph Branca is catching Robinson who is diving for a foul ball, something that might not have happened earlier in the year.  There's a great scene where Dixie Walker, possibly unfairly maligned as an instigator of a potential major league strike against Robinson, calls Robinson aside to give him batting tips.  Rachel Robinson is even invited to hang with the other players' wives.  All in all, an awesome book.  The cliches are true, as this is a book about courage and facing adversity, but it is also a plain old good baseball book, chronicling a very important moment and year in history, not just baseball history.  I heartily recommend this book, as well as Eig's first book "Luckiest Man". 
 Although this isn't the best book I have ever read, I thought it was original and a refreshing take on the "best friend" theme.  I think many reviewers didn't like it because it didn't follow the usual saccharine formula of a best friendship.  The two main characters are not idealized saints, but real, flawed people.  Most "real" friendships are between flawed human beings: that is what makes the friendship so valuable - it has to transcend the shortcomings of the people involved.  Both Clare and Sally have unlikeable traits; they also both have some admirable qualities.  Yes, Clare is selfish, and Sally keeps her head in the sand.  But I found their humanity made the book more interesting.  I agree the author went a bit overboard with all the bizarre tragedies in the book, but the plot at least moved quickly and something interesting was always happening.  You have nothing to lose by giving this book a try.  A word of advice: the story doesn't pick up right away.  You need to stick with it until the two girls are out of college.  Good luck!  
 The author does a good job of selecting the best quotes by the general authorities on finding a suitable marriage companion. The questions are equal to other marriage books on the market, however, the author goes a step further by supplying spiritual questions that should be asked. Questions that dig deep into a person's believes, values and spirit are lacking in other books on the subject. Therefore, I would recommend this book for couples that want questions that have depth into the soul. As a Bishop I have counseled many single adults considering marriage. Now I have a great book to recommend to them. I look forward to her other books 
 Our Golden Retriever loves this toy. But it doesn't last long. He tends to distroy all stuffed toys. The quack is a lot less annoying than a squeak. We keep buying replacement ducks for him, and it's his favorite of all 
 I thrust the Amazon and i love of Amazons reliability, Book is like that What amazons say about it, and delivered before promised. Book is so efficient gives many ideas about the mechanism building techniques... advice to all who deal with nontradition mechanism... and thrust Amazon. 
 This is a great book for people interested in the lives of the upper classes in Renaissance Venice.  It can be a dry read for some, but is informative and interesting in its details.  Based on court documents of the time, it's a great resource for documentation of essays or SCA work 
 In this album, Sleater-Kinney first express the formula which they have since riffed on and perfected like an archetypal dirge, a combination of pre-lingual vocalizations that epitomize music at its expressive apex.  For labellers, DMO effectively marks the band's transition from their lo fi, riot grrl roots into a post-punk fusion of savvy, artistically sound production, intellectually developed and wisened lyrics, and truly talented instrumentation that harnesses the raw power that they always had like never before. If you are coming at this after having heard their earlier work, you will appreciate the more grown-up expressions of feminine longing, rage, and sorrow.  If you are coming at this after having been exposed to post-DMO work, you will appreciate the conglomeration of the catchy tongue-in-cheek, the angrily raw emotive, and the dead-on expression of the bittersweet experiences of relationships, politics, and life in general.  Love it for the progress they made in this album, love it for the kickbutt rock outfit it serves as the cornerstone of, love it for the way you sing along with "Little Babies," but you're gonna love it 
 I like the concept of viewing life and prayer through the four seasons.  I like how the prayers can be used as an individual prays or for group prayer.  The words speak to the heart when one does not have the words within.  It encourages one to be aware of the presence of God in the day to day ordinary.  Simple and direct yet challenging one to move from the head to the heart and be conscious of the movement of prayer.  Helps to open our eyes and see life differently.  A great addition and help especially when planning for prayer for groups. 
 My son got this book when he was 18 months old and he LOVES it!  It is simple enough to keep his attention and not bore him with too many words.  The pictures are perfect.  I would ask questions about what he saw in the picture and he would point things out.  We counted how many houses, how many trees, how many train cars.  We noticed that all the people at the train station were wearing hats, and on the train they were not.  I know this book by heart now and I'm not sick of it.  My son is now 2 and 1/2 and he still wants to read this book 
 Every Christian needs to read this book which confronts us with the inescapable gory nature of our history. We believe in a God who is loving and merciful, but who is also holy and cannot abide evil.  We rightly focus on the New Testament and its message of love and forgiveness for sins: this book reminds us that our salvation has a bloody history, not only in the torture and crucifixion of Christ, but also in the death of many hundreds of thousands of people, by leaders who believed they were ordered to do this by God himself.  Three of the book's contributors understand that Moses, Joshua and David were led by God to wipe out Canaanites, Amalekites, Philistines and others, but Nazarene pacifist C S Cowles believes that the New Testament shows that they were misled.  It is worth reading the articles from the different points of view, but also intriguing to read each author's critique of the others' views.  I felt that each article was worth having been included in the book, but I would have liked to read what an evangelical pacifist with a high view of the bible would have written, too.  Highly recommende 
 It is wonderful to find a useful and compassionate book that helps deal with the regret that often remains after a loved one dies. I had many unresolved feelings, especially anger and distrust, toward each of my parents after they died. Alexandra's heartfelt and practical exercises took the fear and guilt out of expressing my feelings, and gave them a healing container. This book is useful for therapists and family members. 
 I am by no means a manga expert, which is probably just the kind of person this book would appeal to. This series was written in the seventies and is now reintroduced to the English-speaking public with a new translation. This is an example of exactly the kind of story that lends itsself so well to "comics". It's amazing how much meaning and emotion can be captured through these beautifully simplified drawings. You can read this as an adult and enjoy it, but teenagers, even little children can understand it (unless you're offended by cartoon boobies) This fourth book is a must have if you have any of the others. It culminates with a very important part of Siddhartha's life, and makes me all the more excited to read the 5th and 6th book 
 This book is a great collection of stories by and about a Yorkshire veterinarian. If you can get over some of the assignments he has which may make you squeemish, the stories are really really enjoyable and his verbal sketches of people in the small towns are insightful. Overall a fun book that will make you laugh (and is easy to read in bits and pieces when you have time!) 
 This book is easy-to-use and highly detailed with an appealing, bulleted layout and many illustrations that helped to answer most of my basic questions about the four categories of intellectual property (copyright, patents, trademarks and trade secrets).  I took a graduate-level library science course on the legal aspects of information and borrowed several books on IP from the library.  This Nolo Press book was the one that I kept coming back to and wound up buying.  I was glad I waited for the updated 7th edition, which now includes an index.  The book is divided into completely logical sections on definitions, statutes, forms and an overview, all of which make this book a joy to read.  The text is written in plain English and the entries are cross-referenced and other resources are given.  This is a legal book written by lawyers, but the legalese is edited out and only very useful information remains.  If you need one basic legal reference book on IP, this is the one you'll keep reaching for.

 In this third volume of Anne Shirleys life, Anne goes off to college, gets a marriage proposal, and loses a friend.  With everything that happened to her while at college, I just couldnt put it down.  Anne is growing up and having to deal with the trials of being a young adult.  Anne has problems of love and I couldnt stop reading until I found out what happened.  Montgomery does a great job with this sequel and I cant wait to read the next 
 In the manner of Rocky Horror, if you enjoy the bizarre this is for you. A strange offering of sight gags and irreverant humor, sure to please the off the wall crowd 
 Charlie's latest has no weak tracks whatsoever.  The title song is full of tongue-in-cheek humor and rebellion, hearkening to some of John Prine's best songs.  It has one of the catchiest lines ever in country music:  "Buy me a whiskey, get yourself stoned, we gonna have a good time." As usual, Charlie tells a great many stories in his songs:  a unrepentant pleasure seeker lets it all hang out south of the border in "New Year's Day;" a man hits the skids emotionally in "The Bottom;" the narrator remembers his own broken childhood and admires his infant son in "Photograph;" a dissipated adult recalls his first drink and charts his own disgrace in "Something in the Water;" a girl weds a bad man in the haunting "Magnolia," a story-telling style that is reminiscent of Faulkner's "As I Lay Dying." Charlie Robison has more talent as a writer and performer than 99% of anyone in Nashville.  Please buy this album; do yourself a favor.  If you like songs deeper than your average mud puddle but still universally-applicable, this CD is for you 
 I am almost finished listening to the Audible format of this book, and am transported by its graceful and profound simplicity.  The narrator is excellent, skillfully taking on the roles of her narrated characters.  Her characterization of Bernadette is one of innocence and wide-eyed truthfulness, but she is just as equal to giving hard crustiness and slimy hypocrisy to Bernadettes detractors.  To Catholics, this book will be an inspiration.  And to those who have been or are planning to visit Lourdes, it will explain the very un-subtle commercial atmosphere of the town, so unlike Bernadette would have wished 
 Shoes to Die For.This is one of the funniest books I've read in ages.  If you're feeling blah, tired or just plain bored, you owe it to yourself to read it.  Laura Levine uses the same wit and creativity she used to write top sitcom series like The Newhart Show and Laverne and Shirley to cook up this funny, slightly raunchy page-turner that will have you up all night reading it.  The sub-plot about Jaine's retired parents, and their emails is as involving and humorous as the main plot.  I laughed so much, my cat came over to see what was happening!  The characters are well developed, the plot yanks you in, and food-challenged detective Jaine Austin's asides are so funny, you'll be giggling every time you pick the book  up.  
 This version of Pride and Prejudice is the best of several good ones.  It follows the book closely and captures beautifully the spirit of Jane Austin.  Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennett! Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins are also especially well portrayed.  While acurately depicting the 19th century, the story transcends the times by the faithful portrayal of character, which is the central theme of Jane Austen. Not even the excellent 1995 BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle quite comes up to this 1985 DVD edition (miniseries made by BBC in 1979). 
 Callahan is a recovering alcoholic with quite a story to tell.  He violates a few of the rules of 12 step programs by going public with his A.A. affiliation but his story is really great.  He makes fun of all people  and makes you like it 
 In the tradition of Emilio Salgari and Walter Scott, Arturo Perez-Reverte provides us with the benefit of his pen. I got this first series book one year after I received "Limpieza de sangre" and "El oro del rey" as Christmas presents. Fortunately, I kept them on my bookshelf's long waiting list before I decided to read "Las aventuras del capitan Alatriste". A piece of advice: read these books sequentially even though each story is a different adventure. Such characters as Gualterio Mallatesta and Luis de Alquezar get hopscotched in key episodes and knowking their backgrounds is necessary in not getting out of track. The writing is exquisite, melodic, fun, rich and succint. I view the sociological psyche of the average character as the most interesting aspect, specifically the mindsets of 17th century Spanish swashbuckling fortune-hunters, Inquisition officers, mercenaries and poets. The inclusion of renowned Spanish dramatist and poet Francisco de Quevedo is tantamount to sprinkling saphron to paella. It colorizes the story line with necessary chunks of humor. Mr Perez-Reverte's prose is laden with an enviable lexicon that approximates the reader to the reign of Phillip IV without completely abandoning that one of Juan Carlos I 
 Now in a revised and updated edition, 1001 Ways To Reward Employees by motivational expert Bob Nelson is a collection of various ways to motivate employees through positive reinforcement - including day-to-day recognition, informal and intangible recognition, tangible recognition and rewards, group recognition, rewards for specific achievements, and formal reward programs. From bonuses to flexible hours to company stock ownership to a simple email of praise, each method is succinctly discussed with example situations. Appendices include lists of where to get speedy reward items, names of companies that specialize in group rewards, and much more. A handy resource for any business interested in enhancing its productivity through positive influence on its workers. 
 This is another excellent book by Rosemary Altea!  I, like many of the other reviewers, couldn't put it down.  In general, this book is about Rosemary's strugge to understand her psychic abilities (& her fear that she was in some way crazy);the process she went through in developing these special skills; and the wonderful insights she's gained along the way.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interesed in psychic abilities &/or spirituality as a whole.  An open mind is needed to benefit from the insights brought forth 
 This first book of a series about a working class Roman detective, who makes himself out to be a scoundrel while behaving with honor, is a detective story, a romance, but most of all great history about ancient Rome and Roman Briton, with lots of great characters from slaves to the emperor.  It should be in print, along with the rest of the series.  
 This album is without a doubt THE best Metal Church album released, and lead the sonic assault back in the days of Metal. Its an album you can play beginnning to end and then want to hit the "repeat" button as soon as it finishes. A true metal masterpiece, if you have never heard the likes of Metal Church, this is definitely the album to pick up--you will NOT be disappointed 
 Heading: Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul on Love and Friendship         By: Jack Canfield, Mark Victor, and Kimberly Kirberger         Reviewed by: J. Jankaew         Period: 2      This book is about people's relationship between love and friendship. There are many different relationships in this book. Almost all of them are different. Many people have these same problems in their life too, so they should read it too. Teens will learn many things between their loves, and their friendships. Teens show how they feel about their closest relationships. Teens are interviewed in their lives and some of their stories are in this book. In this book it tells the names of the person who is in the relationship, and their age. There are many stories in this book.     I love about everything from this book. I have almost the same relationships and feelings as the people that are in this book are telling. I feel the same way as they do. The first quote I like is under the chapter Saying Good Bye. A teen is experiencing a moment when her best friend is leaving, are moving. The quote is, "Today I said good-bye to my best friend- the one person I have been able to count on for so many years." That is extremely sad. I had that experience once, when my best friend left me, but in this book it tells how she solves her problem. The Second quote is, Just One Look, That's All It Took." That was an amazing quote. That means love at first sight. The girl saw a boy and was in love because she thought he was cute. I had a moment like tat. I saw a guy that I thought was really cute, and I was in love at the first sight.      I didn't really have a favorite part of the book. I liked the entire book. All the stories in this book are fantastic. I have almost the same problems. I love this book because it tells me that I am not the only one that is sad. I don't hate this book one bit. I want other people to read this because; they probably have the same problems too. 
 Considering that this movie came out in 1951, the special effects aren't too bad.  The acting is alright, and anyone that understands astronomy would understand many things in this movie just aren't possible.  Putting that aside, its just a neat old movie, that I had to add to the DVD collection 
 Robert De Niro's directorial debut is a great movie and very under rated. The man has proved himself a genius in the acting field and in this film shows his talent in film making. Great cast and awesome soundtrack. A touching story showing life in the bronx from both the point of view of the working man and from that of the criminals who live the good life. The story deals with the issues of the honest life vs the criminal world and gives an insight into the rough world of the Bronx in an era when it was cut off from most of New York. Chazz Palminteri gives a wonderful portrayal of Mob boss Sonny, both likeable and at times chilling. You find yourself caught between liking him and fearing him and this aspect comes into the story which involves the son of a working class man befriending a mob boss and being torn between the worlds of his two role models. The sub plot involves love between races and the tension between the African and the Italian Bronxites. A fine movie which makes my top films of all time 
 This book is chockfull of recipes that are quick and easy to make - plus even my picky 10 year old will eat them.  The only reason I didn;t give it 5 stars is that I think it could have been printed a little nicer.  The ink ran a little when I got one of the pages wet.  So just be careful about those splats.  Otherwise this is a great cookbook to add to your family's collection 
 This book is one of the first great books that Dr. Kubler-Ross has gifted us with.  Her insight and compassion are unremarkable.  I am sad she won't be writing any more books though.  Her latest book, "On Grief and Grieving" is a wonderful book also.  There are some case studies to go by and it truly touches your soul.  
 My children always grow quiet with wonder when I read this tale of Virgie and her brothers, former slaves of the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. To learn to read and write, the boys travel seven miles each week to get to the school founded by Quakers (folks who love the Lord). They slosh through a river with their pail full of food and move silently through a dark wood. Their little sister Virgie longs to learn too and over the summer she lets everyone know it. After months of her prodding, Virgie's parents agree that she too is free and that even little girls needed to learn. Her big brother CC looks out for her on the trip (she falls in the river but doesn't cry) and enjoys her wonder upon seeing the school and the wonderful, beautiful bookcase full of books. "I'm going to read them all," she says touching them lightly. And from the wonderful writing of her descendant who wrote this book, we know that she must have. It's a beautiful story 
 It's hard for me to believe: I'm almost thirty now, and I wasn't even ten years old when this record came out. I remember hearing "It's the End of the World..." and "The One I Love" when I was in fourth and fifth grade, and being intrigued by the songs, but not knowing who the singers were. It wasn't until Green and "Stand" that I found out who R.E.M. was. And I've loved them ever since.  I listened to the whole album when I was nineteen, and I played it over and over again. This disc is a true masterpiece from beginning to end; all the songs form a cohesive whole, from "Finest Worksong" to "Welcome to the Occupation" to "Lightin' Hopkins."  These four men were some of the people who taught me how to listen to music. It was because of them that I went back and listened to the blues, to jazz, and to early rock and roll. No history of rock and roll or of American music would be complete without R.E.M 
 I had attended 6 AA meetings and still had many questions; How did AA begin?  Is AA right for me?  Are all meetings the same?  What is a sponsor and how do I get one?  What is the Big Book? and what do some of the  slogans they use mean?   Getting started in AA answered all of these  questions and more.  The book is designed in a way to allow readers to read  it straight through or as a referance tool.  It is divided into several  parts so that you can easily skip around to the subjects that interest you  the most.   The content of the book is complete and written so that it can  be read with ease.  Although I skipped around a little, I read most of the  book in one night.  It answered all of my questions and gave me some  guidence as to what to expect and what step to take next. I highly recomend  this book to anyone who is new to AA or maybe has been in the program for a  while, but still has questions about AA.  This is also a good book for  anyone who has never been to AA, but wants to stop drinking and is not sure  if AA is right for them 
 "Love" will probably be the closest thing to a new Beatles album that I will see released in my lifetime.  I was born about a year before John Lennon was shot.  After discovering the Beatles, in my early teens, I felt like I'd been denied something extraordinary.  Here was a man who could sing very well, write great songs, and perform them in such weird ways.  I have never, to this day, heard anything as bizarre and full of ideas as the White Album.  Maybe it was the time when they were making the albums, but I doubt that was all.  The Beatles' albums show me how to make great art.  You can't make it in a vacuum; you can't always make it alone.  The Beatles were a group of talented individuals, coming together, to make something special.   With "Love", George Martin has proven himself as an essential member of the band; that is, if there was any question of that to begin with.  The Beatles were great at experimenting in the studio, but it was always Martin who formalized those experiments.  It was Martin who, during a lunch break, recorded and sped up an organ for the solo in "In My Life."  It was also Martin who recorded a different and, in my option, much more focused outrï¿½ to "Glass Onion" (for evidence of what it sounded like with Lennon's cut, please refer to the version on Anthology 3).  Martin made sure that, no matter what instrument was used, what process it took to get a particular sound, it still came out sounding like a good pop record.   Here, we have the songs deconstructed.  "Glass Onion" is an experiment as daring as "Revolution 9", but with a beat.  "I Am the Walrus" is in full stereo, making it more disorienting (for this song, a good thing).  "Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing" is three songs in less than two minutes.  These songs are ingrained in our DNA; we hear them in the grocery store.  We hear McCartney playing them at the Super Bowl.  For Martin and son to bring out the original inventive spirit in which they were created, lo those many years ago, is an achievement.   If anyone wondered who decided all the vocals should go on one channel and the guitars and drums on the other in those songs on Rubber Soul and Revolver, I think "Love" proves Martin is that man.  In the 5.1 mix, the vocals are prominent on the center speaker, while the instruments are often panned hard to the left and right.  The two rear speakers are used for ambience, and the occasional surprise.  This makes me happy.  The best part of the recording quality of a Beatles record is that you can hear the discreet parts of the song.  Each instrument, each person clapping, even the occasional stray studio sound can be heard.  The listener is the one who makes a recording complete, and in the case of the Beatles, they knew that and created songs that reached out for completion.  This is still the case with "Love."   This album should be remembered for two main things.  The first, more prosaic item is that this will hopefully show how to make an album in 5.1.  You can use multiple speakers and not have a wash of sound (or even a wall of sound).  You can isolate tracks in speakers and still have them fit in with the larger sound.  It's an impressionistic approach to mixing - sit next to one speaker and hear one part of the song, but step back and hear the whole thing.  It's a good trick.     The second reason this album should be remembered is for the people who made it.  The Beatles showed us all how exciting it can be to create.  Their songs resonate to this day because you can hear the people making the music, can actually feel the joy that went into each track.  It is an exceptional combination of artistic talent, craftsmanship, and technology that brings us "Love."  As is always the case, it takes the most effort to reach the simplest truth 
 Evan Billek   2/25/07  The Ragwitch by: Garth Nix 0-06-050807-8  Rag doll or Ragwitch?  Can you imagine a young girl trapped inside the mind of an evil witch? Can you also imagine a young boy on a quest to rescue his sister? Well that all happens in this exciting fantasy book The Ragwitch. Paul and his sister Julia stumble upon an old rag doll one day. The doll takes over Julia's mind and kidnaps her to another world. Paul goes after to rescue her. Paul needs to find the four elementals, so he can rescue Julia. Julia is trapped inside the mind of the ragwitch where she meets others who the ragwitch has taken over. Paul gets four items from the elementals, which get turned into a weapon to kill the ragwitch  I really enjoyed this book. It was a real page turner. It had excitement and the plot was amazing, I didn't want to put it down. The chapters end with cliff hangers which made me want to continue to see what happened next. It was also hooked me because I really enjoy Garth Nix's style of writing. He has a way of having you really get to know the characters. When I know how a character is going to react to something it makes me enjoy the book a lot more. He also did a great job of intertwining two stories, so by the end it all worked out. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who really enjoys fantasy. This was excellent fantasy book because it had strange, weird creatures, and magic, and it took place in a different world. I would also recommend this book because it was very exciting. The author leaves you hanging which keeps you begging for more. The plot was great and it makes you wish the book was longer. If you are a big fantasy fan this is the perfect book for you. It has everything you could ask for and more. This is a great book for anyone eighth grade and up. It is close to four hundred pages long, and it is a moderately difficult read. The Ragwitch  excellent book and I would definitely recommend it. 
 This album is my favorite from Death Cab. I first heard them right after they released Transatlanticism and fell in love. Some of my favorite songs are "A Movie Script Ending," "Why You'd Want to Live Here," "Blacking Out the Friction," and "I Was a Kaleidoscope." However, the entire CD is good, and I never skip a track when listening 
 Shows with specific examples how Jews from a wide variety of life and intellectual perspectives search for G-d in their everyday activities 
 TIME'S MAKIN' CHANGES is the first Tesla album to get. Although the last two songs drag a bit, and "Call It What You Want" is missing, the rest of the album is so good that not even a chronic complainer can resist it. This band was really a hard rock version of the Outlaws- honest and raw, yet melodic. Get this one first, then get MECHANICAL RESONANCE and THE GREAT RADIO CONTROVERSY 
 Mamet's mere name has become shorthand for so much - a style, a voice, violence, woman-hating - that it's hard to just read a book of his, and it's hard to disassociate oneself from the stereotyping of his work, even  if one doesn't agree with the stereotypes.  This is especially true when  reading another of his essay books.  But the violence of the opening story  truly jolted me out of my preconceptions & made me wonder if I could  read on.  I did, and I'm glad.  The matzo ball/bearskin rug story brought a  wan smile to my face, & the title essay is a tremendously evocative  piece of writing that really sticks with you 
 Does contain very helpful information for the beginning cook left out of many "general" cookbooks. All the recipes turn out well, unlike recipes in some other cookbooks that seem like nobody ever tried before publishing them. Good for building confidence in a new cook.  I'm sure many buy this book just for the memories. Bought the 1963 "COOKY BOOK" reproduction mostly for the same reason myself. Although... there are some excellent recipes in there that aren't in the newer books...  I agree with the reviewers who said the bread, cake, pie and pastry recipes are still among the best out there. Tried and true classics that everyone should have.  but...  The appetizer and main dish sections are pretty dated, and thin as well. Even some very basic recipes are not in this book. Stuffed cabbage, stuffed peppers, stuffed pork chops, breaded pork chops, etc... alfredo sauce as another reviewer mentioned... you will not find. Although... there are some pretty cool recipes for foods that were popular in the day and might be fun to serve...  I would say a beginning cook or anyone who wants some EXCELLENT baking recipes should have this book, but definitely another general cookbook as well. Something with more and more modern recipes. Do NOT buy this book if you're looking for a single general cookbook that covers almost everything. There are others that come MUCH closer to that (Fanny Farmer Cookbook, newer Betty Crocker, etc...).  
 I have had my peeler almost 4 years.  It feels great in your hand, has good blade protection for your fingers and has stayed very sharp.  Its great on potatoes, cucumbers and apples.  I was really impressed when I started using it to peel Butternut, Pumpkin and other hard squashes.  So much faster and safer than a knife.  It is truly the best peeler I have ever used.  Buy it 
 The book was awesome, very informative. Couldn't put it down!! I wish it had more pages! 
 Very happy with product and extremely pleased with customer service of travelwithkids 
 Such a wonderful writer - I wish she would write more!!  If there was ever a book or 2 that I would recommend to anyone it would be Carrie's Story and the sequel Safe Word.  She puts you in Carrie's head and lets you truly understand and feel what she is going through.  Bring on the ponies!! 
 A Jules Vernes classic, this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time.  True, there are some items that may seem a bit dated, and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible.  Yet, this novel is still a joy to read.  With a stoic Icelander as their guide, a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic, as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist.  Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality), the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth, which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno.  I won't serve as spoiler, but sufficed to say, that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth.  Vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint.  Their instruments, a crude electric light and others, would be considered state-of-the art for their time.  Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth.  Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body.  And if you take Verne's theories to heart (although modern science refutes them), their journey is plausible.  However, I do have a couple minor gripes.  Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations, which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel.  Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist, the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line.  Also, there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic. During their rapid ascent (the details I won't reveal), the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness (a.k.a., "the bends").  Although it was still a new phenomena at the time, I believe Vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure, as he did during their slow descent into the abyss.  The nitpicking aside, this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time.  A modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at Verne's vision of a subterranean world.  Nearly a century and a half later, Vernes' works still inspire awe and imagination 
 This album is greatness!  New King George songs, but same great traditional country music.  Every song is great!  Well worth it... 
 This was a great fun read for the beach.  I loved all the characters in this book.  This book was fun, witty and had lots of action in it.  It is a great intro to the Plum series. It makes you want to get the next one in the series right away. If your looking for a fun very fast read look this one up, you will not be disappointed.   
 I found this book easy to read and understand, the exercises easy to perform, and the benefits are immediate.  You begin to see changes in how you breathe and how much more fully your energy flows right away.  Excellent buy, I am planning to buy more copies to hand out to friends 
 Whenever I heard any song, that featured Lalah Hathaway as the guest, featured vocalist, I always wished that there was an CD out that I could just listen to her sing to me again, and again. Finally, my prayers have been answered! I thoroughly appreciate the effort that she puts forth to bring excellent performances on every thing that she does. It is truly a joy to listen to this CD. In a time when many of the vocalists that are out today use "electronic processes" to help them with their intonation, Lalah sings "true to form" with no "outside help". She also has an uncanny ability to sing in lower registers without losing the feminine tone in her voice! (Something that I find amazing) There isn't a bad song on this CD. Some songs may be better than others, but all of the are well worth the purchase price. I really enjoyed "We Were 2" because it gives you a hint of what it's like to experience Lalah in a live performance. I say, "buy it!"  peace,  mik 
 If you want a good well written book about the rise of Americas Army from a basically small constabulary to one of the great fighting machines. Which then went out to detroy one of the greatest threats to the Republic then you have come to the right place. I especially like how the Author has rightfully laid the credit to one of Americas unsung heros George C. Marshall. An outstanding job as far as I am concerned 
 It is amazing to me that this work has not received more serious attention by the general public and the medical profession. It is an excellent book about a very serious problem effecting a large number of people. 
 Here's another series I didn't get to see very much back in the day.  But its a great one.  This first season is only 13 episodes, but its worth picking up!  You'll get to see the origin story of the new Batman and why Bruce Wane put aside the mantle of the bat.  In this season, Mr. Freeze is also revisited in one of my favorite episodes, Meltdown.  We're also introduced to some new and interesting villains in this Gothum of the future such as Derrick Powers aka Blight.  I don't want to give too much away, but this is a must have for any avid Batman fan.  Kevin Conroy reprises his role as Bruce Wane from the Batman animated series for one thing.  The voice talent in this series is just as fantastic as the previous one.  So buy it!  
 Cooking up a storm is a great cook book for kids of all ages. I have 3 kids ages 7, 11 and 16 and each one of them has enjoyed using this book to make some Fab food. Before this book they would get bored if they tried to use a cook book but with the pictures, explanations and real funny captions they were glued to it. Not only that but it has everything you could want to cook in it so its even useful for us adults. Anything that will get my kids in the kitchen making real food deserves some credit. I would definitely reccomend it! 
 It makes Citizen Kane look amateurish. The finest most profound film of our time. "Proof" that TV writers are our greatest artistes. 
 My mom played this for me a few years ago, and I listened to it a lot until I lost the disc.  Finally I found it again, heh heh.  Anyway, I really love this CD.  The songs are all really pretty, and it all sounds really natural.  I mean, they don't have weird synthesized stuff or anything, haha.  It almost reminds me of the first pioneers in Israel.  ^^  Buy this CD!  I heart it 
 This book is good for the basics of food storage and emergency preparedness.  Much of the information coincides with information from the LDS chuch and includes instructions on preparing Long Term Food Storage, First Aid Kits, 72-Hour Kits, and food rotation.  Good book for those just starting out in their emergency preparations 
 Here's the key to uncracking The Crying of Lot 49.  I used the book while I was reading Pynchon's novel while in a high school leterary club.  With the novel's complexities, I never would have been able to understand the book with out this helpful companion. The book follows the novel in chapters pointing out everything that you may have missed.  Much of what was pointed out I did infact miss never thinking Pynchon might have been using an illusion or just not understanding what the illusion was.  This book is a must 
 The comment on editor (using the reviewer's sacred space) is not out of place. Amazon has a different logic to treat people. In the previous incarnation amazon.com had an option for author's to comment. Now, I presume, it is turned into Guide.  amazon.co.uk and amazon.ca have differences in this regard, and in the ultimate this strategy (of sorts) hurts the authors, reviewers, commentators, etc.  Internet in Everyday Life is a kind of book that I could lay my hands, on the very day it appeared in the market.  --- Comments forthcoming --- I will be back soon and give a full picture of the book, its structure, approach and value for the every day life 
 A thoroughly enjoyable reading experience, this book expands on what Feynman wrote in "Adventures of a Curious Character" (ACC), although this book stands alone (you need not have read the first). Feynman, in his characteristic, modest and endearing style engages the reader page after page. He expands details mentioned in ACC as well as introducing new, and just as engaging, material. His light-hearted approach to serious matters and his expression of insatiable lust for knowledge in an enjoyable style makes this book a pleasure to read. I find it hard to fault this book and page after page it kept me wanting to read more. Reading the book makes you want to go out and satisfy all those childhood curiosities that, unfortunately, some of us lose in adult life. I read the book at night and found myself constantly wanting to go outside and look for frogs, insects and other wonders of the natural world. If I did have to find fault in the book, it would only be that it kept me up later at night than usual--a great book, by a great man 
 I have always been a fan of british music, eg  UFO Sweet Def Leppard, and The Babys were one of my favourites.  I ordered their CDs through a music shop in Australia about ten years ago only to find out they had recently been deleted and were unavailable.  Imagine my delight to see they had all been released again.  The new liner notes are excellent as are the photos, my only gripe is, that unlike many rereleased CDs these days,  there are no "bonus track" such as demo versions or alternate versions of tracks off the CD or dare we hope a track or two which previously never saw the light of day.  All I need now is Rovers Return and Mask of Smiles and my John Waite collection will be complete.  Its just a shame that such a brilliant band as The Babys only gave us 5 albums 
 As a long time Steven King fan, I do not understand how I missed reading this series of books.  They are certainly one of his most involved and rivoting creations.  I highly recommend putting the time into them.  
 There are no doubt countless introductions to Greek philosophy, but amidst the vast sea of choices this book easily floats above the rest. Professor Cornford's writing is rare, he displays a clear mastery of the subject and conveys his vast knowledge in a manner that is refreshingly lucid.  There is no complex language to unpack or needless detail to confuse his presentation of the material. Cornford approaches the subject by addressing the general themes associated with the Ionians, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.  This is a nice approach because the beginner, rather than being lost in detail, is given the "big picture" with which he can then orient the details of further reading. This is the greatest virtue of Cornford's book, and it is for that reason that I so highly recommend it 
 I have been a huge fan of DeLorme State Atlas and Gazetteer books for 20+ years. I will never plan a trip without one. I find them absolutely indispensable and have them with me on any car trip, period. I do however have a preference for the older style of mapping used on the earlier editions. I used to own an old Utah Atlas and Gazetteer and much preferred it to the new one. The enhanced topo information and colorations are neat but the actual road mappings have a new style that are annoying to me. It is much harder with longer dashed lines for unimproved roads to determine whether the road intersects another one. Anyone who does backroading in Utah knows that when a road is near another on the map does not mean they intersect. One road could be 1000 feet below another and both will dead-end. It is not fun to plan a trip not being sure whether your road goes through. Although I still like the maps, I feel the need to have another topo source for backroads. I wish DeLorme would update their Atlas and Gazeteers in the old format rather than the 'slick' newer style 
 I am still using this product now, and my blackheads are diminishing. I would recommend this product 
 This is a great album from start to finish.  An instrumental album which can be described as neither post-rock nor math-rock.  It is filled with guitar driven epics that are flavored with a hint of cello and piano.  The songs come off unflawed and sincere, unlike some of the works of the more pretentious, so called "hip" artists, who wish they could come up with something this brilliant.  No lyrics are needed!! 
 This book is truely for beginners who have no clue of signal Integrity. He starts this book with stuff like Ohm's law and how capacitors and inductors work which most people learn in high school.   But his explanations are really simple and easy to understand without lots of technical jargon. Very good for beginners bot not so good for more experienced engineers 
 I am teaching a 5 week spiritual gardening class using this book as a guide.  As the first chapter teaches, it makes you stop and listen to what God is telling you and makes you look at your own spiritual garden.  I would recommend this book to everyone, gardener or not.  
 I Like the first one better but there is only two songs I like, "butter ball" and "lemon tree"....well one more "green peppers" the cd does sound like lounge music to me but that is ok....If you like herb albert give it a try buy the cd to see if it sounds good 
 Brutal enforcer!   Strongest of the Piraka, Reidak lives for destruction. His power to adapt after every defeat makes him virtually unstoppable! His infrared and thermal imaging vision lets him track down his enemies so he can send them to crushing defeat. His combination drill and buzz saw can turn solid ground to quicksand! Includes zamor spheres and launcher. Piraka eyes light up and teeth glow in the dark!  
 Wow. What a range of emotions this book produced in me. At least once my mouth fell open in shock.  Several times I burst out laughing and also unexpectably burst into tears. OK, I'm emotional. I thoroughly enjoyed the stories of Dr.Buten's patients and feel he must be a very intelligent, compassionate, insightfull and slightly off beat person 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Light hearted good fun with lots of ideas for Red Hat Ladies. Loved the section on the names 
 "The Face", the first book in this volume, is probably the best of the five Demon Princes novels.  The reasons are manifest.  Villainous Lens Larque provides some of the best challenges and intimidation for our hero, Kirth Gersen.  There's the usual helping of exquisite writing and fine descriptions; the menu items during Gersen's restraunt visits are particularly noteworthy.  Most importantly, "The Face" is the most morally challenging novel in the series.  It presents, to some extent, the best argument for Gersen abandoning his single-minded hunt for revenge in his abortive attempts at romance with two characters.  Lastly, "The Face" has a killer ending, laugh-out-loud serious if there ever was such a thing.  Another notable element is the planet Dar Sai and its inhabitants, the Darsh.  Dar Sai is odd even by Vance standards.  Giant umbrellas of water protect folks from searing daytime heat, the women grow mustaches, food is prized for its repulsiveness and gender wars are taken to a whole new level.  Vance scores particular points by showing us the spoiled tourists who visit solely to mock the backwards Darsh.  An just dessert is served for them at the end, of course.  The last novel in the series, "The Book of Dreams", is competent but less biting than "The Face".  The new villain, Howard Alan Treesong, is less impressively hateable than Lens Larque or Viole Falshune from "The Palace of Love".  "The Book of Dreams" contains vignettes set on numerous planets, none of them particuarly brilliant.  The best parts of this novel are the introductory segments to each chapter.  Short paragraphs cover a wide range of ground, from the hilarious philosophical basis of the Institute to the stunning character introductions for Treesong's various Paladins 
 I actually talked with Israel Finkelstein prior to his publication of this book and I remember being very concerned.  In order to do proper biblical analysis, I think the application of two skill sets is most preferable:  1)  An appreciation of the curated material that the Bible gives...or text analysis and  2)  An appreciation of the extra biblical material including not only archeologicial findings but other preserved historical writings and traditions.  The reason I was concerned about this book when I talked with Finkelstein was because he didn't then give me the feeling that he was familiar with, let alone, respectful of the process of text analysis.  Traditional text analysis tells us that the Old Testament of the Bible was composed by five basic authors:  1)  A J author, so called because he (she, according to Harold Bloom) consistently refers to god as Yahweh (or Jahweh/Jehovah as rendered by the original German text critics) throughout his tale of creation and exodus;  2)  An E author, so called because he supposedly hailed from Ephraim or Israel, the northern Yahweh worshiping Iron Age Canaanite community and called his god Elohim (at least until he revealed his name to Moses at the opening of Exodus);  3)  A P author so called because his textual emandations focused on matters of concern to Priests;  4) A D author connected with Deuteronomy and Samuel 1 and 2 and Kings 1 and 2...the Bible's so called Deuteronomistic history; and  5) An R author so called because he made the final redactions necssary to bring these materials together as a complete account.  However, it is significant to point out that even these materials have been deemed to be predated under text analysis by other biblical materials most notably including:  1)  Exodus 15...the Song of the Sea, dated by text analysis to around 13 to 12 hundred BCE;  2)  Deuteronomy 33...the Blessing of Moses, dated by text analysis to around the time of the Song of the Sea;  3)  Judges 5...the Song of Deborah, dated between the Song of the Sea and the Blessing of Moses and   4)  The Blessing of Jacob...at the end of Genesis dated to around the time of King David.  As can be seen from the foregoing discussion, a text analysis, properly utilized could reveal much in terms of understanding the Bible's origins.  That's why I was very pleased to see that in his finished work, Finkelstein produced a product showing respect for not only the archeological field work he has been so connected with but also the text analysis that can be so helpful in rendering competent opinions on biblical origins.  Needless to say, what Finkelstein says about biblical origins does carry great evidentiary support.  As a couple of for instances:  1)  The David and Solomon monarchies were little more than country hill chiefdoms.  This account, as he correctly points out, squares not only with the archeological evidence showing little growth in Jerusalem until some two hundred years following the time of David and Solomon, it also squares with other text evidence and text analysis he didn't even quote from.  Again, citing the Song of Deborah, it is noteworthy to find that the tribe of Judah (David's tribe) is not even mentioned and when it is mentioned in older biblical text material (the Blessing of Moses) the notice is not very abbreviated...consistent with Finkelstein's claim of the humble origins of David and Solomon.  This also squares with text analysis provided by Mark Smith in his The Early History of God wherein Smith makes the case that the early biblical representations of the miraculous origins of Yahweh worship were themselves later emandations from the times of Hezekiah and Josiah...again in accord with points made by Finkelstein in this book.  2)  Judah and Israel were in reality two separate kingdoms for which a claim of mythic original unity was only made after the fall of Israel to Sargon II under King Hoshea in 721 BCE.  Here again, a review of the Song of Deborah notably shows the absence of Judah as joining under the forces of Barak.  And here again, Mark Smith's book would again easily harmonize with the Finkelstein thesis that a joint ancient Israel and Judah under David and Solomon was merely a later created myth of origins.  Admittedly, and particularly as to the second for instance just mentioned, there remains the notice in the Blessing of Moses which seemingly unites Judah with the Israelite tribes as part of a common entity.  And admittedly there is also the scholarship of Richard Friedman (author of:  Who wrote the Bible, The Hidden Book in the Bible, among others) whose text analysis fails to easily and fully harmonize with all the dating and all the suppositions made by Finkelstein.    However, these discrepancies serve like this book itself, not to hinder but to further one of the most fascinating of inquiries:  the historical bonafides of the Bible itself 
 We purchased this kayak a few weeks ago and have enjoyed using it in our nearby lake.    Initial use is very easy.  We had it set up and inflated within fifteen minutes, using a hand pump for inflation.  Note, the kayak does not include paddles, so remember to purchase them as well.  The kayak comfortably seats two people, with room for storage in the front and rear of the kayak.  We're using this to stow lifejackets for our boys.  The kayak includes two inflatable, removable seats which can be moved around or removed.  We've found that they are very comfortable and actually make rowing and maneuvering easier.  The kayak also has an easy to open and close drain for letting water out of the boat.  The size of this kayak makes it so easy for using and transporting.  Our 11 year old can carry it on his own and it actually fit inside our van fully inflated.  I don't plan on taking the kayak on any rapids, but for use on local lakes and calm rivers, it seems to be the perfect solution 
 I just played my new copy of this 1979 album on CD and was delighted with the excellent vocal performances of the American singer Rickie Lee Jones, an artist the bulk of whose music was not previously known to me. Though, as a radio listener from the late 70's onwards, I was well acquainted with her cool, jazz-styled tune Chuck E's In Love (#4 chart hit, 1979), which remains her most well-known commercial release. However, I did not know just how richly-talented and expressive Ms. Jones was until today when I heard the other 10 songs on this album, her recording debut. She has some beautiful, wistful moments mixed in with terrific storytelling and some coolly seductive poses. She sounds like she can sing anything well. And, I note that she wrote all 11 titles herself, which is great, because I really rate singer-songwriters most highly.  One other thing: This lady has a refreshingly-different way of singing words and phrases that defies convention and sounds like her own unique style. The songs in general also don't tend to follow verse-chorus-bridge-chorus structures either, and this makes for a more-interesting and less-predictable album.  I really like this, and am awarding it 5 stars !!  
 It's very sharp lens.  You will be wised to use it extensively on little children, they have such clear faces.  Be careful when you use this lens with middle age women.  It could show imperfecton in thousand fold.  Again very sharp, very fast Af focusing on my Nikon F80.  Ecxelent portrature lens, but be careful-women will hate you for unflattering portrature.  My advise use black and white film-you will see less imperfection in prints with the same rasor sharp focus 
 I first fell in love with this at a friend's house.  I couldn't believe how easily it opened!  My toe had just barely touched the foot pedal. WOW.   I didn't have to turn my foot to the side to get enough pressure to push on the pedal.  My friend told me all about the can, and it was on the top of my Christmas list.  Yes, a trash can.  But not any trash can, a $100 trash can!  My friends thought I was nuts.  But my dear husband made my dreams come true, and purchased the can for me.    I've now had it 8 mos. and am thrilled with it.  Here's what I LOVE:      - There is a little shelf for the inner liner can to rest upon.  This helps you take out the trash bag and put a new one in.  NICE feature.      - There is no metal handle to get in the way of the trash bag.  You know...the one that always tugs & rips the bag.      - The bag releases & comes out easily.       - You don't see the the trash bag from the outside of the can.  It doesn't hang over the edge, but tucks neatly inside.     
 By far this is the best aid for torts if you are looking for some extra help before exams.  Not only does the book explain things very clearly and help with outlining, but the questions and practice essays are PERFECT.    Simply doing the questions in these books will be a solid day of review that is sure to boost your confidence when you walk into your torts exam!    A must have for law students 
 I just bought this book a few days ago after reading the positive reviews.  It was definitely worth reading!  The best part about the book is the tone she uses.  It really does come across as girlfriend-to-girlfriend.  It's not clinical (which is a turn-off) or condescending in tone - she doesn't act like a sex guru speaking down to the plebian undersexed.  She's very encouraging and her main goal is to give you confidence as a lover.   Some of the stuff isn't all mind-blowing or new, but if you're like me, it's kind of nice to read it and think, hmmm, maybe I do have a little sex goddess in me.  For example, her sections on how to set an erotic mood and turn on your partner are more useful as a sort of confidence-boosting talk than for really specific ideas.  The section on fellatio also, is not as detailed or advanced as some might like (this is not the book to buy for that).  The section on manual (hand) techniques was very thorough and detailed, though.  I'm  sure I'm only going to be able to learn a few at a time.  And there are other tricks scattered through the book that seem simple, but really erotic.  She also has some excellent sections on STDs and safe sex.  Before I started reading up on sex, I didn't know how important a condom for oral sex is.  It's important info to get - told from the perspective of the sexually active, not your high school sex ed teacher, so you learn how to best avoid contracting an STD and still have sex 
 It is a funny book and a good book. I think it is funny bcause first the dog hates the cat and the cat hates the dog. And my 2nd reason is because the dogs name is chuck and he throws up in someones car and so they change his name to Up Chuck instead of Chuck.                        #1 boo 
 Nothing To Fear is a riveting page-turner filled with compelling characters that could easily spin off into their own stories.  Ethan and Dana don't allow them to steal the show as they fight their own personal demons and face down a villainous woman bent on revenge.  Just when you think you can relax, you can't.  This novel is filled with twists and surprises that will keep you up at night. 
 This is one of the most wonderful films I have ever seen. Why it was not given the academy award for best documentary the year of it's release I'll never know. This film will captivate you from begining to end. This is a sad yet masterfully told story of a simple people who by the death of a brother are propelled into the not so simple world of the judicial system. It is also a feel good story of a town who will do most anything to back their own. Im sure after seeing this Documentary you will be as moved as I was 
 I'm so glad that finally Denise wrote a book concerning this problem. I finally understood why I couldn't loose weight in that area. Now I can see a clear picture why, after all of those workouts in the past -my stomach still looked horrible. In this book you can go through the test-that will show you your tummy type, so you will know how to work on it. This program is so easy to follow, I actually had fun reading and finding about all of those new things for me (fun tummy truth and how to pick the right product at the store). I kind of had a feeling that I was starting a new life-organizing my kitchen and planning my day. I became more organized with everything. My husband and kids started eating so much better. Denise is just such a good motivator. I finally made myself get up every morning and exercise 
 What a wonderful way to introduce Shakespeare to children!  I used this book as a third grade teacher to teach inner city kids about Macbeth.  It was amazing to hear the students discussing all of the characters and their  actions.   They were proud of themselves for learning about Shakespeare  "like high school kids."  If you make it fun, they will have fun 
 Lesley and Roy Adkins' book on Roman civilization is a thourough categorical text covering everything from political institutions to fashion. The book also has extensive photographs and illustrations detailing countless subjects such as military formations and equipment, roads, city plans and development, architecture, etc., etc. For a general reference guide, it's the most exhaustive, detailed, and accurate text I have ever found. A perfect book that can be easily used by adults or children, and teachers or students.  If you are just beginning to learn about Roman civilization, I strongly recommend this book above all other introductory texts: there's simply no comparison! As you learn more of the basic information, the book has an excellent bibliography and reference guide to authoritative books or academic texts that focus on a specific area. This book is truly one of the best investments one can make in the study of ancient Rome.  
 the north caused and profitted from slavery more than history books tell. this fabulous story shows two brothers who embodied the american quest for liberty while confronting the great question that still haunts our country today.  incredible circumstances find the battle between abolition and slavery contained in one family, and details how the north defended slavery during the birth of our nation.  
 If you're interested in forensics, chances are you'll like this book.  The book also manages to tie in sexual abuse, repressed memories, Miss., Vietnam, PTSD, and a little romance.  It even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long.  I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book's plot and discussions as intricate as they are 
 An excellent overview of a controversial subject. Nothing in it should seriously offend either proponents of scientific medicine or proponents of alternative medicine. It is a good quick reference to most of the herbs and therapies in use today. Its presentation is balanced; giving pros, cons, possible side effects, dosages, etc. It clearly states which claims are based on proof, and which claims are not generally accepted. Particularly valuable is its discussion of how to choose what is best for you without getting scammed 
 My husband and I are adopting a baby boy. I have been trying to find a 'Big Sister' book for our daughter, but so many of them are about mom being pregnant and giving birth to the new sibling. This  book is the only one I have seen that is suitable for both situations (adoption or giving birth). The story itself is simple, but very sweet and reassuring for the older child. My daughter absolutely loves it.  
 A frightening memoir of growing up under Iran's male-dominated oppressors, confirming that the mad ayatollahs have, in 27 years, wrecked a once-vibrant nation and destroyed its culture. Omid's Iran is a dysfunctional society in a "coma of ignorance," led by "mindless fanatics." Males are obsessed with money and hymens. Women, if they aren't victims, have sold out and joined the Pasdar spies who hound female violators of the ayatollahs' decrees. Throughout, Omid displays numerous perceptive, valuable observations: Ayatollah Khomeini's command of Farsi was so weak he could barely be understood; his mullahs took the Shah's palaces after the overthrow, then cornered the black market for food to become "even richer" than the Shah; 70 percent of Iran's villages have been destroyed or abandoned under the mullahs. She also harbors no illusions about Iran's wickedness: "If Iran becomes a nuclear power," she warns, "the world should start digging, either their shelters or their graves..." What is most riveting, however, is her striking journal of personal pain within her abusive family-her brother forced her into persistent incest, her wealthy father humiliated her and abandoned the family to destitution and she was forced to battle her way out of one arranged engagement after another. Little wonder she has emerged on the far side, in Vancouver, as a brittle manic-depressive finding it difficult to outrun her past. Omid wrote most of Living in Hell in a single month while under a therapist's care, imbuing the work with a powerful sense of urgency. Passionate and commanding.

 A former member of forgettable bands such as The Jewels, The Rollers and The Souls, Al Wilson started to click on the Rocky Road label and the hits began. "Show and Tell, La La Peace Song" and "I Won't Last a Day Without You/Let me be the One" were instant classics. The latter "slashed "song was a common practice in the 70's, taking two individual songs and combining them into one. Other examples are "The Way we Were/Try to Remember" by Gladys Knight and "Runaway/Happy Together" by Tony Orlando and Dawn. Most of the reviews that I have done so far are on the lesser known artists because just like their commercial successful counterparts, they deserve  to be heard and remembered as well. And , it was Al Wilson that sang these songs, not Al Green 
 Steven Wise accomplishes his goal admirably in his latest book. That is, he explains how consistant logic when applied to our current legal system mandates animal rights. Ironically, his critics within the animal rights movement apparently did not read the book. Mr. Wise makes it very clear that he is making a legal argument not a philosophic one. After all, we have Tom Regan addressing the philosophic issues of animal rights. I think Mr. Wise is to be commended for bringing his expertise in law to the table and exposing the inconsistancies that exist in our judical systems treatment of animals. I also think he does an excellent job of making the information accessible to those of us without a legal background. He does a super job of making a potentially dry subject riveting. Good job, Steve and thank you! Jean Swingle Greek, co-author of Sacred Cows and Golden Geese and Specious Scienc 
 Y'all should shut up before talking. These "garbage" dance remixes that you ignorants are talking about are what made Corrs have top10 hit after top10 hit, whilst the originals flopped badly. The remixes are all superb, and anyone who disagrees has poor music taste 
 Although I loved Through a Glass Darkly and Now Face to Face, I wasn't aware of Dark Angels until I happened upon it in an airport bookshop. It is one of those rare books that is so engaging I was able to tune out all the miseries of flying and just read. And in this case, reading was pure joy. I loved the depth of the characters and details of the setting. Koen's characters are flawed, but in ways that make them seem real. This book is an example of how historical fiction should be done 
 For many of us Weather Report fanatics this is the Holy Grail of WP live videos. If you're like me, you already own a bootleg of this show. I have two, the second being slightly better in quality to the first, with even  a hand held audience camera (horrible quality) filling in Dr Honora ex Causa/Directions tune which was missing from the television broadcast from whence the bootleg was born.   But this is a whole other level of quality. The good folks at Eagle Vision should be commended for taking the original filmed concert and lovingly restoring it to its full length. Even more impressive than the crystal clear video and continuity is the superior sound. We are given no less than three formats to choose from, Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS(!) and PCM stereo. The DTS sounds great on my system, putting this outstanding performance under  an aural magnifying glass. One can hear so many details that the first viewing/listening was startling, even though I have viewed the bootleg countless times. The PCM stereo version is also superb-encoded as it is @48k and 16 bit, it surpasses CD specs and sounds it too, considering the 1976 concert quality source. I should note that the balance of the band is a little off at the beginning, but quickly adjusts to a satisfactory mix for most of the show. Overall , the bass is a bit weak and the percussion a little too forward for my tastes, but its close enough to not get in the way of really enjoying the music.  As for the performance, well, if you don't know why WP was considered such a big deal ,this document should convince you of their importance in modern jazz history. This was before they played the big concert venues and added all the lights and smoke. This is not a show band: this a seriously committed group of players who came to blow the walls off the hall. And blow the walls off they do. Presented with this 'take no prisoners' attitude, even the somewhat restrained Montreux audience is visibly moved to standing applause by the end.   This is the Heavy Weather band before Heavy Weather. (But listen: Zawinul was messing around with the Birdland lick at the beginning of ex causa-and isn't that the bass riff from River People that jaco's playing in Gibraltar?)  The material ranges from early Zawinul (ex Causa) through Black Market. The intensity and focus never wavers for an instant, even in the introspective moments. It's fascinating to watch these younger incarnations of the legends we know today.  This younger Zawinul,  whose stage persona is not known to be particularly engaging, is postively (dare I say it?) gleeful at times. He even smiles on several occasions. Wayne is ever the enigmatic poet, rarely coming up for air to peer out at the crowd. This was Jaco Pasorius' second live gig with the band, and he seems to be out to prove himself to the Big Boys. There are no shennanigans and no grand standing on this set-Jaco's not playing to the crowd- he's clearly here to make music.   Another delight of this set is the spirited interplay between percussionist Manolo Badrena and drummer Alex Acuna. They smile,cajole and even playfully taunt one another,constantly upping the excitement on stage. They are a pleasure to watch. Their enthusiasm and good natured comradery adds to the overall good vibe of the performance. This band is having fun.  I noticed Amazon has lowered the price from the $14 I paid for my copy. Honestly, it would be well worth the price at twice the price. This is a long sought after gem. Don't miss it.  Now if only someone would come out with that legendary Belgrade video.. 
 Blackalicious is an amazing group, and Gift of Gab is one of the most talented lyricist - not only in the sense of finding the perfect words to express his thoughts, but in composing them in such a way that they create absolutely addictive rhythm.   Blazing Arrow is by far his best CD, and it's the best because not a single song amongst the lot is short of instant classic. Alphabet Aerobics and Chemical Calisthenics are awe-inspiring in their wit. Blazing Arrow and Nowhere Fast are completely flawless tracks. But Make You Feel That Way and Release are nothing short of a pure ecstasy - the former just makes you smile and the later is nothing short of a masterpiece with Saul Williams adding his brilliant poetry.  Get this CD if you like hip-hop. Get this CD if you don't like hip-hop. Get it now, and be convinced that the genre is worthy of the highest laurels 
 This is a wonderful book, obviously written from the heart by a person with a lot of experience with Karuna Reiki.  I love all the suggestions for combining the symbols.  Working with the meditations and journal have been powerful experiences for me. I learned so much more than I did in my Karuna class.  I hope to go Sedona, Arizona one day and repeat the class with the author.  Thank you 
 I'll make this review brief as there have been many that have covered what I'm writing on this right here.  Willie is an American musical legend and this album lives up to the hype.  I, being a reggae music afficianado, had many doubts about his pulling off this genre respectfully.  Thankfully, I was surprised by this set.  He has made the most listenable reggae-fusion album ever recorded to this date (yeah, that is what I wrote).  Willie is more musically important than he has ever been in 2006. (with Johnny Cash & Waylon Jennings gone).  Long live Willie!!!!   
 I have now finished "American Sphinx" by Joseph Ellis. Excellent book! Excellent writing! And, I must say, on an excellent website. You see, I took the trouble to sift through the reviews written on "American Sphinx" before deciding whether I should buy it to read and keep in my library, or read a copy from the library. I'm happy that I decided to buy it for it is a book every history "buff" should have. And, I am also glad that I took the recommendation of several reviews on the "American Sphinx" website and read Norman Thomas Remick's "West Point: Thomas Jefferson ..." that is drawn from what Jefferson himself read and wrote. Though not scholarly written like Joseph Ellis' book, it was a rather big surprise in how different it was in its presentation and how insightful it was toward Jefferson without opinionating. A good one to read when you have finished Joseph Ellis' "American Sphinx". It takes the mysteriousness out of Jefferson's personality and actions.

 Let me start by saying that The Wheel is not a new CD for me...I have been a long time Rosanne Cash fan so I am writing a long overdue rave review about 10 years late. I write now, because I just recently rediscovered the power and perfection of this amazing collection of 11 gems. Listening again with a new perspective and sounding brand new all over again! Rosannes's lyrics, and poetic song writing style combined with her amazing ability to wrestle with the deepest human emotions make this an absolute must have CD for these times of reflection. While her previous CD "Interiors" dealt with heartbreak and other human failings in an almost cathartic way, "The Wheel" portrays the ultimate triumph of the human condition, and tells it in a way that very few singer / songwriters can. Rosanne Cash both lyrically and musically is a unique treasure. If you are not moved by this CD, I do not know what would. I guess that this chance rediscovery of one of my all time favorites is some measure of compensation for missing new musical and lyrical offerings from one of my very favorite all time artists! Add this to your collection...you will be richly rewarded 
 I purchased this item as a gift for an artist friend, she was very happy with the quality of the reproductions in this book. 
 A new girl called Ashley is in Claud's neighbourhood and she is one awful little weirdy thing.She makes friends with Claudia and demands that Claudia be JUST like her and that she stays away from her other friends!!Ashley is extremely eccentric and nasty and is obsessed with fire hydrants 
 This book is not for everyone. If you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away.  For lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature, this is a good book. A lot of things are amazing, considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time. Some of it just boggles my mind.   At the same time, the book is long winded and in the end, not quite as much happens as one would expect. Dan Brown's DaVinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than Verne has in his entire book. But that is OK in a way, because when I read a classic, I do not expect to compare it to modern standards. The entertainment is due to different factors. In fact, the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story.  I do not give this book 5 stars however, because I was disappointed in the end, since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion. I do not want to spoil the book for you, but there are a lot of unanswered questions, and getting those answers really was what kept me reading. There is quite a bit of build-up, and then in some ways, the book just ends. (I noticed that style in many books of that time, where the narrator just says "here is what I know... but I do not know the whole story...").  Also, to some extent, I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score, in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story. I do not complain about some of it being like a log book, but I would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board. I just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room. They must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat. Or at least attempted it, and that would have been interesting to read about, without breaking with the overall style of the book 
 This compiliation of fairy stories is amazing! I enjoyed all of them greatly. I liked Tengu Mountain, The Price of Glamour, Never Never, Imersed in Matter, The Shooter at the Heartcock Waterhole, and The Annals of Eelin-Ok the best. At first I wasn't going to read it because it was so long, but I liked it so much it took me 3 days to read 350 pages. I couldn't stop! I liked this book so much because the stories are all so different and unique. The faries are all so different, and so I never got bored. Never Never was the same plot as Peter Pan, just told in the point of view of Captain Hook. If you want to read a book that is fun, interesting, and a great journey, read the Faery Reel 
 This is probably one of my favorites.  She has characters you care about from the beginning and the deceased father's entangling demands to inherit his property and money are an added way of punishing his children for his indifference to them thoughout their lives 
 great buy from the private used books from your amazon website. Excellent delivery time 
 I did not know that Mike Pinera was in this particular group, or at least I forgot. This second album is extremly good, reminding me of the Iron Butterfly's albums (i.e. Metamorphosis) in which the same guitarist/singer was playing, a little later in the seventies. Excellent stuff. Great voice 
 I had this book laying around for 2 years before I decided to actually begin reading it. It just didn't seem like my type of book, but when I started reading it, I couldnt stop. Cleo's character is very lovable. I had just gotten done reading a JAK book before this one that was not very good, so I was hoping to come across a novel by her that I would enjoy. Well, I've found it! This book is packed with love, humor, suspense, and anything else that makes up a good novel. Do yourself a favor and check it out 
 My husband suggested that I read this book because I am not a huge non-fiction reader and I didn't know a lot about what was going on over in Iraq.  This book talks about war and 9/11 in terms that everyday people who don't have a huge interest in war can understand.  I watch the news, but it is always so sad and depressing that I often would rather watch my daughter's TV shows.  Chris explains what is going on over in Iraq, the kinds of weapons we have, the tanks, etc.  It is very informative.  The humor and feelings that Chris has endear him to you immediately.  I really enjoyed reading this book, and would suggest it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the war, from a surprisingly neutral position 
 Mao: The Unknown Story is one of those books that is hard to believe. It is hard to believe someone caused the death of so many millions of people, yet little is known about it. It is hard to believe Mao did not care if over half of the earth was killed in a nuclear war as long as he became a dominant world leader. It is hard to believe that Richard Nixon's visit to China was responsible for our withdrawl from Vietnam, the entrance of China into the UN and the security council, and that Nixon traded prestige by his vist (and subsequent votes in the US) for assistance in the modernization of Chineese arms. Ping pong for respect of a terrible tyrant - a poor trade.  Yes, this is not an easy read, but a necessary one. How could a mad man play politics so well and succeed in torturing, maiming and killing so many of his own people? Unbelievable! How could someone cause the many years of starvation his people just to become a world power? This is a story that had to be told as most of us would never suspect something so terrible.  Just as "The Killing Fields" is a difficult but necessary film to watch, so is this book. We must know the history to avoid it in the future 
 This book is one very hot read.  All three stories in this book are awesome.  Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  You will not be disappointed with this book.  The authors are a must buy for me now 
 I switched to digital a few years ago, and my little Olympus was fine for outdoor shots, but I missed my old Pentax Spotmatic, especially indoors without a flash.  I got this camera because of the recent lowered price.  I am very pleased that with the Nikon it's like having my old camara back, but with digital. It does everything extremely well, and learning the operation was simple.  I especilly like the P mode. I was worried that the steep discount in price meant something was wrong with the camera, but this doesn't seem to be the case.  Comparing it to similarly priced digitals, this is a great buy! People seem to be going for the big telephotos, but the wide angle lens is very handy. And I always wanted a Nikon... 
 I understand that many people are disapointed in the quaility of this set.  However you must realize that you are looking at the less expensive and there for lower quality knives.  This doesnt not mean they are not good.  These knives are better than any other in this price range.  Just understand that you are not going to get the $50.00 per knife set and you will be more than satisfied with the purchase.  I was 
 Of all the great Irish women singers (Cathy Jordan of Dervish, Niamh Parsons, Delores Keane, etc), Karan Casey is my favorite. Karan is back with her second solo album after her superb debut "Songlines". The most striking difference in this CD are the spare arrangements compared to Songlines where the tracks included many of her band members from SOLAS. Here, accompaniment is provided mainly by Ted Barnes on guitar and bouzouki, with occasional appearances by Donald Shaw on piano, Michael McGoldrick on flute and Niall Vallelly on concertina (a treat). The focus is almost entirely on Karan's singing which 	 in its slightly understated way brings enormous impact to the intense, often political, largely traditional songs she has chosen with several in Gaelic. Not quite as approachable as "Songlines", this CD a wonderfully thoughtful, fascinating, 	 poetic and highly effective exploration of human dramas of the heart and war through song both old and new. Very highly recommended.       And if you don't already have them, be sure to pick up SOLAS's first three CDs which feature Karan plus some mighty instrumental playing 
 This book gives a good summary of several important concepts related to the financial markets. It is a truly introductory level book but it is highly recommended if you are looking for a complete overview to fill up the gaps in your basic knowledge. Highly readable, even for people without a formal background in economoy but with a basic practical knowledge of the financial markets.  One negative point concerns paragraphs where the history of certain concepts is described or where practical examples are given, applying to different countries in the world : these are often too elaborated without any clear added value. This book is also recommended by 'The Economist' magazine. 
 Being a big Billie Holiday fan, I admit to listening to this CD with some skepticism.  There have been many Billie tribute CD's over the years, few ever equalling her soulfulness and artistry, but after listening to this CD, Etta really opens my eyes and ears.  I wouldn't expect someone primarily known as a soul-R&B singer to nail down these songs in an entirely new blues-soul context yet retaining its jazz structure.  She doesn't really have Billie's fragility of phrasing, but shows the same X factor of emotional and gut-wrenching elements in her interpretations, though on a grander scale.  She adds some of her ever-present feistiness as well, which of course Billie never had, but it never detracts from the jazz feel of this CD.  Feistiness is, after all, what makes her Etta James.  She shows remarkable restraint when she needs to be in this jazz context.  Congrats to a brave Etta in tackling these songs so identified with Billie.  You pulled it off, girl 
 Loved this book !!  I've read it cover to cover a few times now, and like it more and more each time.  Great photos of every project.  Some history on specific shawls, which I appreciate.  Lots of different folks' designs, which is nice.  I'm an intermediate knitter but new to lace.  About to start my first shawl, wish me luck  
 I loved this book and think you will too. It shows that the original design of the cosmos created by a SUPERIOR MIND and Being told the story of mankind. Astrology is a cheap substitute for ancient truth. These ancient  truths in no way conflict with the Scripture, rather they buttress it in  many ways. An amazing work!  I reviewed this work for a publication I edit 
 great book. awesome pictures and paper quality. Very good price in amazon. Thanks 
 This book is not an "upper."  If you're looking for something light to read during Spring Break, don't choose this one.  You'll be depressed for a month.  It's a good read, though, if by the word "good," one intends to say "thought-provoking" or "contemplative."  After I finished this book, I couldn't stop talking about it.  I made all my friends watch the film (because I knew they'd never read a book like this), and I sat back and watched with twisted amusement the black fury that resulted from their expectation that this would be a story with a happy ending.  I know, I have problems. The book is all about a girl called Lily.  She's a young woman who's been raised by her wealthy relative, but whose expensive taste in fashion and friends proves to be her downfall.   Apparently this story is meant to make us step back and examine society.  We are supposed to tilt our heads, squint, and walk away with a sense that poor Lily Bart was wronged by the world she lived in.  I'm not saying that's not the case. However, I think there's another chunk of truth to gnaw on.  When I finished reading this book, I sat there thinking for a bit, and I realized that the protagonist destroyed her reputation, and, ultimately her life, over a bunch of frilly dresses.  I thought that was the saddest part of all.  Poor Lily Bart was so enslaved by her addiction to pretty things, and so unable to foresee the consequences of her actions, that in the end she was ruined because she couldn't walk past Saks without walking in.  Now THAT is a real tragedy. 
 This is the second volume of Braudels Civilization and Capitalism. The second volume deals with the market economy, while the first volume, Structures of Everyday Life takes on infra-economy or material civilization. As I said on the review of the first volume, in the pre-industrialized societies, the market system is not the only form of resource allocation. The material civilization is the first layer of economy on the bottom, the market system is the second layer located above the first layer. The exchange or commerce was not natural economy but artificial economy in the jargon of the 18th C economics: Market is premised on the separation of production and consumption. Such a division is not natural, but is developed over long time. In this vein, the market is not natural at all. The market is the point in which material life and economic life meet each other. The market is the network. It links region to region, national economy to national economy. The form and scope of market has been evolved over time. When we track the forms of market, we could paint the history of capitalism. Nonetheless, Capitalism is often regarded as synonymous to market economy. But market is not unique to capitalism. But it goes without saying that capitalism cant exist without market. All economic activities under capitalism are carried out on the market. Changes in the form of market signals the changes of capitalism. When, for example,  we talk about globalization, we have in mind the change of market based on national economy to global market. The second volume is about the topology of market. Based on the scope of space the market serves, we could trace out the path of capitalism since the 15th C. But market is not capitalism. To understand this point, youd better check the third volume, The Perspective of the World 
 Within the musical niche he's creating, he did a very good job.  This was Norman's first big album, and I think he solidified his style with it.  The sound of Better Living through Chemistry is synth-rock house with a very American, westward-looking feel to it.  This album is for those who want thumping, rock-oriented, synthetic, energized, and inherently loud music.  For people who criticize great tunes like "Everybody Needs a 303" and "Give the Po' Man a Break" as repetitive, I say that they're not listening to the way the song is developing over time.  My favorite track is "Santa Cruz."  It conjures great imagery and contains one of the longest and best builds I've ever heard from a song 
 I read this book years ago and I continue to get much out of his ideas.  Discussions based on the  ideas in his book are almost always guaranteed to spiral into engaging and revealing exchanges.  For me, more useful than  "Eight Weeks..." 
 Hey what can I say about this book? A great book. The quality is in the name Schums's 
 You can really tell Govi puts his heart into his work. He produces very beautiful music. This is a great album with some very uplifting tracks. I am happy to have some Govi in my collection. I also own Andalusian Nights and can recommend that as well 
 This video was quite interesting and mind opening. A lot of it is in subtitles which wasn't a problem for me and it is rather short, just over a 1/2 hour. Overall though, a very interesting DVD 
 This is a really good product.  I have gotten 8 rather than 6 uses out of it.  The cups really stay put unlike other stick-on bras I've tried plus it enhaces your cleavage.  They do run a bit small so if you are a larger cup size, move up one for the best coverage.  I will definitely purchase again.  Well worth the price 
 Other reviewers have outlined the content of this series so I won't repeat it.  I will tell you how I found 'Slings and Arrows.'  I saw a review in our local paper (Peter Carlin) which sounded interesting.  I bought it and I'm glad I did.  It's well written, well acted, and entertaining.  You'll be disappointed, however, if you prefer the gross humor, shocking violence and other plastic stereotypes of US television.  My only disappointment is that each volume contains only six episodes.  Maybe that's the price one pays for quality 
 i bought season 1,2 and 3 and loved them all.. all you people bitching about the music being all bad.. well what do you expect its from the late 80's and early 90's? season 3 is my favorite out of the 3 seasons out so far, but if your buying them it would help if you buy and watch them in order. I cant wait until all 11 seasons are on dvd. This was definaly worth the money 
 I read this book almost exactly ten years ago and still remember its excellent portrayal of England in the mid-19th century, down to tiny details other writers might not have troubled to include. This is the suspenseful, creative story of the robbery of great train, during an age when the railroad was still new enough to be seen as something of a miracle of human invention. The tale of the master rogue's plotting, the drilling and preparation he and his chosen crew put into the conspiracy, and the final launching of the scheme, all of this and many more factors make The Great Train Robbery one of Crichton's best and most colorful works 
 I have used every version of Final Cut Pro since 1.2, and I wish I had discovered Rick Young's book earlier. Although I have the edition just before this one, I found it to be one of the best books on how to actually use this software to do what you want that I've seen. Fantastic, it's a shame it's not available everywhere. It's what you need 
 This is a story about a goose who gets blamed for stealing treasure which he didn't steal. The best part was when you find out who the real thief is. I might have given it five stars if all the characters were human 
 This was a book I read a long time ago, and it was one of the first books that I noted didn't follow a set pattern or formula.  Alice's affair with the doctor came as a surprise as well as the flirtations with her mother's  eccentric boyfriend.  This book doesn't disappoint, you feel Alice's pain,  the physical pain (laced with appropriate sarcastic remarks) as well as the  emotional pain she feels when going from a healthy young woman into a  bedridden sour soul, back into an upright citizen.  I read this book at  least 3 times it was that enjoyable, Alice was a fun character to revisit.   A 
 a week in the woods is based on a kid and his classmates going on a field trip called the week in the woods 
 I've gotten recommendations for David Levithan's books before, but I'd never read any.  I picked this up at the bookstore and was hooked.  Although I enjoyed basically every part of this book, my favorite was Charlotte's narrative.  I cannot express how much I loved it, how much I wanted to be like her and do that.  "The Realm of Possibility" is definitely worth reading; it won't take you long.  It is amazing 
 Nominated for 25 Golden Globes and 110 Emmys, including 7 for Outstanding Drama Series, ER has long been one of the best prime-time shows on television. Premiering in September 1994 on NBC, the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across America. Brought into being by Michael Crichton - famous Hollywood insider, novelist, and brains behind such films as Jurassic Park, Twister, and Timeline - ER fulfills its creator's ultimate vision (it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the ER. Since its inception, many cast members have passed through the halls of ER, many of them having gone on to become big stars in Hollywood...  ER follows the exploits of a group of emergency room staff who work in a busy Chicago hospital. The show attempts to examine every detail of the ER experience. From the exhilaration of saving a life to the tedium caused by mountains of paperwork, all the highs and lows are covered. In the show's first year, a number of regular faces staffed the ER. Doctors Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), Douglas Ross (George Clooney), and Susan Lewis (Sherri Stringfield) were regulars in the ER along with Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) and Benton's medical student understudy (and later ER doctor), John Carter (Noah Wyle)... Any given episode tends to run multiple plot lines throughout the show, interweaving scenes in short snippets intended to heighten audience emotion and create the aura of a stress-laden atmosphere. The show's high drama, coupled with subplots of the staffers' personal lives and the display of cutting edge medical technology, combine to make ER one of most adrenaline-inducing programs in television history...   The ER (Season 1) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the series premiere "24 Hours" in which a long day in the ER is made longer when multiple casualties pour through the doors following the collapse of a building and medical students report for training (marking the first appearance for John Carter's character). Meanwhile, Dr. Benton performs a heart surgery normally reserved only for senior staff members while the staff is struck with a personal tragedy when Head Nurse Carol Hathaway is brought in following a suicide attempt... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include "Blizzard" in which a major snowstorm first leads to an empty ER and then (following a 40-car pileup) one with overflowing capacity, and "House of Cards" in which, while trying to keep up with Carter, Deb nearly causes a patient's death...  Below is a list of episodes included on the ER (Season 1) DVD:  Episode 1 (24 Hours: Part 1)  Episode 2 (24 Hours: Part 2)  Episode 3 (Day One)  Episode 4 (Going Home)  Episode 5 (Hit and Run)  Episode 6 (Into That Good Night)  Episode 7 (Chicago Heat)  Episode 8 (Another Perfect Day)  Episode 9 (9  Hours)  Episode 10 (ER Confidential)  Episode 11 (Blizzard)  Episode 12 (The Gift)  Episode 13 (Happy New Year)  Episode 14 (Luck of the Draw)  Episode 15 (Long Day's Journey)  Episode 16 (Feb. 5, '95)  Episode 17 (Make of Two Hearts)  Episode 18 (The Birthday Party)  Episode 19 (Sleepless in Chicago)  Episode 20 (Love's Labor Lost)  Episode 21 (Full Moon, Saturday Night)  Episode 22 (House of Cards)  Episode 23 (Men Plan, God Laughs)  Episode 24 (Love Among the Ruins)  Episode 25 (Motherhood)  Episode 26 (Everything Old is New Again)   The DVD Repor 
 In the past I've had various crop circle photos and calendars put to me but its never raised much more than an inaudible grunt.  But after listening to Silva on Mysteries of the Mind radio, I didn't hesitate in going on-line and getting his book.  Regardless if you believe crop circles are made by ET's or not, the consciousness that is behind them is intriguing to say the least.  How is it that tests of the soil inside the circles show no moisture yet soil outside the circle does?  Why do compasses not work?  Why do people feel nauseous and experience time loss inside them?  Why does it take the fakers two days instead of the minutes the real ones take to make and even then they still look forged?  In terms of value for money I give Silva's work 5 stars purely because of the depth of material and glossy photos.  There are interesting connections made to sacred geometry which after trying to digest Drunvalo Melchideks Flower of Life manuals I found quite useful.  But those readers with more advanced knowledge of geometry may find it superfluous, but thats what fingers are for - skipping the bits you might already know.  Personally I'm ambivalent if the maths and geometry formula's don't stack up to what's conventionally accepted.  Quantum science at least shows we are energy based beings and our reality reflects our consciousness.  Its quite apparent these designs are energetic in nature and hopefully will bypass the rational mind and speak directly to the Spirit.  A very interesting book and I'd also recommend his DVD "Stairways to Heaven".  Regards, Daniel John Hancoc 
 I love this movie, I watch it with or without my kids. its so cute, it always puts me in a good mood 
 My 11 year old and I are very much enjoying this recording. I think it really makes the book live in a way that I could not when I read it aloud. Every parent should have books on tape to play in the car---it keeps the backseat quiet and hands to themselves. (There may be other places where those things would be desireable too, of course. 
 I don't know about you, but sometimes I stumble upon a book that is a salve to my soul; I am not happy about one thing or another, and I need someone to talk to, talk at, or listen to--I need to look into someone else's life so that I can feel human again and not totally strange and alone.  Nora Ephron's HEARTBURN did that for me, and for that I will put it on my bookshelf, along with the many books that have served the same purpose.  On my second reading I could not remember if the story was based on the author's life.  I was afraid that I might not enjoy it if it was  pure fiction.  I was wrong.  The book is a very, very funny satire of the Washington scene, whch has not changed.  It is also a tale of real angst and heartbreak.  What is basically a sad story has delicious veins of humor, wistfulness, sadness, prosaic pragmatism, and real recipes marbling through it, all of which magically meld into a satisfying whole: but that is what a work of art can do.  
 I am surprised at the low star rating on this book as it was truly a good read.  However, having said that, I'm still in a quandary about who did it!  Who killed Vance Calder?  I used to think Arrington wasn't too bad, but in this book I really lost respect for her.  She's a weak whiner and doesn't have much understanding for others or a backbone to stand up for herself.  Stone, of course, continues to be a whore and sleep with every beautiful dame that comes along.  I really hope he's finished with Arrington, but I have my doubts.  Is Arrington's son Vance Calder's or Stone Barrington's child?  We still don't know, but we have our suspicions because Calder had enough money to get the original DNA tests skewed.  I simply love Dino and Stone sure should have listened to his partner about getting involved with Dolce.  What a frightening mess that woman is!  Truly, it's a fun ride in the life of Stone Barrington...especially if you want to listen to the book on tape 
 I have this book and was looking for other books by Mr. Daniele since I had him as a teacher years ago at Ludlow.  One of the best classes I've ever taken.  He is a master craftsman with wood and metal, and certainly respected and admired the colonial period.  He conveyed this respect to his  classes,and through his books, I am able to convey it to my sons.  The  drawings and instructions are clear and easily used by all levels of  woodworker.  Lots of photos of finished peices.  Ideal for the home  hobbiest 
 Get excited, get inspired and get ignited! Those are the three chapters of the book that will move you from generic exerciser to training for a goal: Triathlon. You may be reading the book because you want to stay in shape or because one of your friends is doing it or you just love new challenges but for any reason you'll enjoy the writing and approach of this book. My favorite quip: "Short of giving birth or cutting off your head there is no way to lose ten pounds in a week..." It's full of technical details about gear too so your dollars don't get slim while you do 
 this book is a delightful exploration of a life few of us will ever get to experience -- that of rural France.  You get an exploration of rural life, in itself quite fascinating to this city dweller, coupled with an introduction to life in another culture.  Every chapter taught me something new and was a joy to read.  The only disappointment was when I saw myself drawing towards the end of the book and wished it would go on longer!  I can't wait to see Sanders' next book.  Coincidentally, I should add, I have also read his other book "The Yard" and bought this one not knowing it was by the same author.  Both books are equally enjoyable, and the author seems to me to have taken over the mantle of writing about small groups of people from Tracy Kidder who did a fantastic job with his early books such as "Soul of a New Machine" but seems to have lost his way in later books like "Small Town".  I do, however, have a little quibble with some of the other 4-or-less reviews that are posted.  Almost uniformly they praise the book but find some minor flaw that leads them to mark it down.  Heck, nothing's perfect. I hope that those perusing these reviews read the comments to see how well this book had been received by amazon customers instead of worrying about what the rating isn't higher 
 I love this book the most!!!I have gotten so many affirmations that I say daily and believe it or not, really really help.  Clears my head and I have good thoughts, not negative ones. Awesome Book!!! 
 A serious, honest bio-pic of the self-destructive, though highly influential, social comic Lenny Bruce. Using the device of taping interviews with those who knew him (especially with his wife, Honey, played by Valerie Perrine), the movie recounts Bruce's life in chronological order, with the interviews interspliced to make the film look like a "story." Dustin Hoffman, a versitile actor ever willing to take on "unusual" roles at this time, is Lenny, and he does an excellent job. Filmed by Bob Fosse in stunning b&w; the movie doesn't try to glorify Bruce in any way. As a piece of film making, it's terrific. Definitely worth a watch 
 I received this as a gift. Being that I've been an eBay PowerSeller on several different accounts, I honestly didn't think I'd learn much from this.   I might have simply put the book down after the first chapter, but one thing I can say about Joseph Sinclair is that he is very easy to read. I ended up reading nearly everything in there. And even though I already knew most of what's in there, I did end up learning quite a bit, and was able to take a new perspective on everything that I already knew.  Overall, I'd say this book is best for those new to selling on eBay, but even the most hardened eBay vets will be able to grab scraps of goodness from it 
 Written by former politician Stephen Goldsmith and global director of Deloitte Research, Public Sector William D. Eggers, Governing by Network: The New Shape of the Public Sector exposes a largely hidden but nonetheless monumental transformation in the manner that public services are delivered and local and national governments fulfill their policy goals. Dubbed "governing by network", it presents great challenges to those in charge: skill-set issues (managing a contract to capture value); technology issues (keeping information systems compatible with one another); communications issues; cultural issues (including differences between public, private and nonprofit sector cultures) and much more. Governing by Network clearly outlines what works in a networked state and what is a recipe for failure, using case studies as well as firmly established practices. Chapters focus on achieving the goals of efficiency and effectiveness in the constantly changing and increasingly technological 21st century. Governing by Network is especially recommended for political leaders, political science teachers, political science students, and school library collections for its invaluable contribution to observing dramatic shifts in leadership and day-to-day practice requirements. 
 I went back and bought this album after buying Renaissance and being blow away. In fact, I've gone back and bought a lot of Seaman. The cd is off to a slow start and picks up a little bit with Moby's Porcelain. It also has Way Out West, James Holden and Junkie XL. The second disc is a superb set but the first disc falls short 
 After coaxing a shopkeeper in Jerusalem's Old City to part with his "not for sale" heirloom treasure map for a whopping six hundred shekels, Afghan author Tahir Shah sets off on an adventure to find the legendary gold mines of King Solomon.  He speculates that the mysterious Ophir the Bible describes as the location of the mines may likely be found "just a short boat trip down the Red Sea" in Ethiopa, a land with extraordinary reserves of gold and ostensibly the home of the Queen of Sheba.  Known as Makeda in Ethiopian texts, the Queen of Sheba, according to Ethiopian legend, purportedly bore a son, Menelik, by King Solomon through whom the imperial family of Ethiopia descends.  Tahir journeys Ethiopia first to Addis Ababa, south to Kebra Mengist and Bedakaysa, east to Harar and Dire Dawa, north to Lalibela, the Danakil Desert, and Debra Damo, then west to Tallul Wallel.  Along the way, the reader comes to know a little about the land and the people of Ethiopia.  Where even a haircut or a bus ride or encounters with guide-dogs for the blind are laden with danger, Tahir insists "the thrill lies in surviving".    Somehow the discordance between Shah's engaging brusque humorous style and the stories that reveal to the reader the bleak reality of existence for many Ethiopians works, as he makes the reader want to laugh, sigh, and cry all at once.  I highly recommend this colorful travelogue/adventure story/geography-culture-history book as it is an exciting, entertaining, and educational read 
 I found it a bit difficult to follow this lecture by Mr Chomsky.  It required that I really pay attention and concentrate on what he says ... he is extremely understated with his speech so if you don't take your time and really listen you can miss out on the point he is trying to make.    However, when you take the time and truly listen to Mr Chomsky's lectures they blow you away with the simple, accurate info he allows you to see.  You start to see yourself as mentally inept while you ask yourself, "my god, that is so simple ... Why didn't I see or think of that?"  He really is that good/brilliant.  Well thought out lecture by Mr Chomsky that really packs a punch and doesn't mince words.  He cleary respects his audience's intelligence and you can learn a lot from this man.

 Both of my children, aged 6 and 8, just love Junie B. and Boss of Lunch was one of the funniest yet 
 Jonathan Edwards was without a doubt the greatest theologian America ever produced.  That he was also without a doubt the greatest philosopher colonial America ever produced shows what theology was once upon a time in  America.  Obsessed with returning American churches to its more devout  Calvinist roots, Edwards began the Great Awakening in America, only to find  himself cast out of his own pulpit for daring to challenge the social order  of his church.  Edwards deeply investigated the concept of free will,  reconciling it as no other theologian had with the doctrines of  predestination and divine omnipotence.  But Edwards was also a figure of  the Enlightenment, and applied Locke's rationalist doctrine of the senses  to his preaching style, creating almost singlehandedly the  fire-and-brimstone approach used to this day to terrify poor sinners into  repentance.  Perry Miller, the twentieth century's most dominant American  intellectual historian, here explicates the life of Jonathan Edwards as no  one has before or since: on the merit of his ideas.  Miller was an atheist  who spent his life studying American religious movements; this was one of  his finest works.  Not to be missed by anyone interested in the history of  American religion or philosophy 
 I really liked and enjoyed this movie.  The acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention.  It will keep yours too, just give it a chance.  Sure, it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry, but they deserve it and need to be more responsible.  I may buy the DVD to watch it again, but am overwhelmed with the movies I have bought from amazon.com and not gotten around to watching.  However, I may add this to my collection 
 Cool disc if you like TCM.  Better than TWEAKEND though not as wicked as VEGAS, COMMUNITY SERVICE is a continuous mix of great electronic music with very little vocal disruptions.  These guys create the best remixes and are top of the heap in techno.  Cool, cool stuff 
 The concept of training Christians to be mature, reproducing Christians is not a new concept.  Nor is it a concept that is controversial.  Christians know that this is an important issue, taught and modeled not only by Jesus but by his followers throughout the New Testament.  The problem lies in application.  A healthy, disciple producing church can be hard to come by, and even in individual Christians' lives, the practice of discipleship can be a rare commodity.  This book is valuable in that it outlines the biblical view on discipleship, but the book goes further in providing many concrete examples of how discipleship is to be pulled off.  An appendix in the back is essentially a guide for discipleship meetings giving thirty important topics and the tools to be able to hold a bible study with each of these topics.  A characteristic of the book that I especially appreciated and found helpful was the author's continual emphasis of the role of the Word of God in discipleship.  This is the foundation for the theory of discipleship, and it is also the main tool that we use in actually performing discipleship.  This book is refreshingly simple, yet challenging.  It is challenging because there is amazing potential in doing biblical discipleship in our churches and in our individual lives.     The only negative I found in the book was one that I commonly struggle with when reading Christian non-fiction.  At times the author appears arrogant, especially in the use of personal experiences.  There was more than one story in this book about how some misguided individual was enlightened by the wise example of the author himself.  This writing style always bothers me and always comes across as arrogant.  Do not let this distract from the main thrust of the book, for the content of the book is valuable 
 This documentary actually turns out to be quite a lot more than a political polemic, and it's all the better for it.  Naturally, extreme lovers of Bush will be put off immediately, but no surprise there.  And, people looking for straight Bush bashing may be disappointed as well.  This is not an expose into the darker side of the Retard King, and it purposely goes easy on the conspiratorial tone.  There is a significant, though not entirely fleshed out, subtext about media control and the consequences of that, but mostly this is a story about some fascinating, driven, rather demented people and their travails amongst the big fish.  In other words, it's most entertaining and enlightening on a human level, not a political one.    I will say that the `revelation' at the end is so extreme that it changes the perception of the entire narrative, and it's something which the movie itself never entirely comes to grips with.  The way it's structured does give the momentum of the drama a naturalistic feel, but I wonder if there wasn't a better, more upfront way to rework it and maintain the impact.  However, the sense of howling into the wind is subtle and well played, and the real human drama of people striving to be more than they actually are (even by duplicitous means) opens up a whole range of connections between GWB, the author and the publisher.   The idea that the publisher and the author are to some extent frauds, or at the very least unabashed showmen, would call into question the validity of the whole documentary if the approach didn't feel genuinely vérité, which is why it works much better as a depiction of flawed humanity than as an investigation into the (also interesting) issues with the book, media, etc 
 Saddam's Bombmaker is an important contribution to our understanding of the challenges faced by groups and states trying to produce their own nuclear weapon.   How Iraq and Hamza went about trying to obtain fissile materiel and advanced tools and parts is the most interesting and important part of the book.  You will be alternatively pleased at how hard it is to obtain some items (like plutonium) and dismayed at how easy it is to obtain others from willing states and companies.  The book should be read by those interested in obtaining a better understanding of nuclear proliferation. Now to the shortcomings of the book---  (1) the chronology is hard to follow, the author doesn't reference a lot of dates and flips back and forth between present, past and future. (2) It's hard to not to become skeptical of Dr. Hamza's motives at certain points.  He claims to have been forced and terrorized to work on Saddam's bomb, but was simultaneously enjoying all the comforts and benefits that Saddam's regime had to offer like new cars, high living and perks.  One wonders whether Dr. Hamza's conscience really caught up with him as he claims, or did he just read the writing on the wall that there was no future in Saddam's Iraq?  
 I have been waiting for another Scotty Anderson CD since his amazing Triple Stop.  I really like this CD, but it does not have the same impact as Triple Stop.  Maybe it's just because you're so amazed the first time you hear Scotty that the second time doesn't carry the same punch.  Or not.  One problem with this CD is the vocal tracks.  The singer  on LaGrange fits OK, but that gurgling gritty voice (voices?  I didn't check the credits) singing "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" and "Boogie On Reggae Woman" just doesn't work.  As for Scotty, he shows his amazing versatility here, but LaGrange just doesn't fit.  I'm certainly open to a different interpretation than the original from Z.Z. Top, but this was more of a cover than a new take.  And in spite of Scotty's gifts, he never sounds comfortable trying to sound down & dirty on this one.  Scotty's strength is playing inventive, complex lines at breakneck speed, impossibly cleanly.  He's not a "big balls" rock player, which is what this song needs.  This is the only song where I've ever heard him use any distortion at all and adding a box on the cable doesn't change one's playing style--this tune is the equivalent of a kid putting on his big brother's football uniform and it just sort of hangs on him.  "Going Down This Road Feeling Bad" is a fine bit of country classic pickin'.  "All My Lovin'" sounds like he is channeling Chet Atkins.  Fasten your seatbelt for "Honey Fingers," aptly named.  On "Milk Cow Blues" Scotty gives his lightning chops a little rest and shows that he can really emote the blues.  "Ruby Are You Mad At Your Man" is a rollicking bluegrass ride with no time for a breath.  "16 Candles" is done with a bit of a blues feel and works well.  This CD belongs in any guitarist's collection, and also that of any instrumental music lover.  I'm sorry to have spent so much time on the weak points instead of the strong, but the strong points are really strong.  Cherry-pick the best tunes (which is most of them) for your iPod 
 Sam Simms (Sinbad) is an unorthodox Secret Service agent.  The Secret Service assigns Agent Simms to protect the President's son, Luke Davenport (Brock Pierce of "Might Ducks"), code named Prince.  Luke has managed to dispose of several previous Secret Service agents by driving them crazy, including Agent Woods (Timothy Busfield of "Thirtysomething" and "The West Wing").  The movie tries to portray Luke as a child ignored by his famous mother and father and unable to have a normal childhood.  Though I empathize with Luke a little, he also generally acts wimpy.  However, thirteen-year-old Luke has stirrings of normality as he gains a huge crush on classmate Katie Warren (Erin Williby in her final role) and has a run-in with the class bully.  After the run-in with class bully Rob (Zachery Ty Bryan), Luke and Agent Simms begin to bond, and this movie really takes off.  Much of the movie is humorous, as it was intended to be.  Most of the humor works, making this movie generally enjoyable.  Sinbad steals the show, as you might expect.  Sinbad mixes slapstick and one-liners that only occasionally clunk.  Sinbad makes Luke Davenport look good and sparks life into the plot.  As with many Disney movies of this type, there are serious undertones.  The movie becomes most serious near the end when Luke Davenport runs away from the White House and encounters a life threatening situation.  Secret Service agents are in a panic as they try to locate the President's son.  Fortunately, Agent Simms, just fired from the Secret Service for aiding Luke in going to a school dance, has a way of finding Luke that only Agent Simms knows about.  The end of this movie is nicely plotted and enjoyable to watch.  I enjoyed watching Sinbad in this movie.  Sinbad's comedy was generally fun, and he handles himself well.  Most of the cast did very well.  I would have replaced Luke Davenport with another actor, or would have had him perform with more confidence in school.  Luke Davenport ran rings around the Secret Service and yet he was unable to keep from embarrassing himself.  The plot was agreeable, with an action ending that provided a nice capstone to the comedy.  There is some mild violence that generated a PG rating, but this movie should be suitable for most family members down to about age 7 or 8.  Enjoy! 
 Kenneth C Davis presents an unvarnished look at the history of America from Columbus to mid-2002. His viewpoint incorporates modern scholarship and sensibilities and avoids the traditional oatmeal that America is always right and good, but not in a particularly accusatory or condemning way. For example, it exposes Jackson, Sherman, and others for their mistreatment of the Indians but doesn't actually condemn them. It explains Washington and Jefferson's ownership of slaves without apologizing for them.  That said, Davis makes some of the traditional mistakes, such as mistaking presidential politics for history, treating peace as just the uneventful time between wars, and focusing on meaningless scandals (his conclusion after a long discourse on Jefferson and Sally Hemmings? "We don't know.") Davis fails to address the rise of high technology any more than the rise of heavy industry. There's not one word about developments that define modern American culture: cinema, rock-and-roll, suburban sprawl, e-mail, and so on.  Still, Davis addresses the major events we all learn about in school but forget the details of and does so in an engaging and meaningful way. A note to audiophiles: I listened to the unabridged version on CD and found the frequent lengthy timelines to be hard to follow, especially since the narrator doesn't reiterate the year for each event 
 Being an avid fan of Sue Grafton and having read all the other Alphabet mysteries, I was not disappointed.  Kinsey Millhone seem to grow more emotionally in this book.  The storyline was intriguing and at the same time very bizarre.  You can't believe human nature could be so wrong.  I recommend this book and author highly 
 I have been watching Joyce Meyer on TV for many years, but have not read any of her books until recently.  This book spoke to me "right where I am".  It puts a handle on the reality of worry and anxiety.  Casting your cares on the Lord and being anxious for nothing, does not mean that you don't care about what is going on in your life.  It means that you are totally dependant on God.  Thanks Joyce 
 Ann keeps up the good fight in this 'telling' tale of the left's compassion(less) form of debate.  Pointing out many instances of lost arguments devolving into name calling.  I couldn't recommend this any more strongly to those on the right or left.  For those on the right, you're not the only one that notices their lies.  For those on the left, you're not fooling anyone anymore, not with Ann keeping score 
 This movie is so funny, classic porky's type movie but with a sweet message. Dont help girls who love bad boys they will break your heart, completely unexpected ending for a raunchy pre-American Pie comedy.. still worth the crabs, I mean the laughs 
 This should be read in conjunction with "God's Secretaries." McGrath does a good job of outlining the historical setting, the difficulties in translation, the goals in translation, and the King James Version's impact on a culture. "God's Secretaries" goes into the personalities of the translators, which is one topic that "In The beginning" lacks. The two books complement each other well.   The book was very good and organized well. The problem was the editing. I found typos and he has a tendency to repeat short phrases. However, these are minor flaws and the topics he covers helped explain how the KJV Bible fit into its cultural milieu. McGrath shows how the translators goals in translation and how they choose to translate Hebrew idioms introduced commons saying in our own language. McGrath pointed out the language of the KJV was archaic even in its own day and Mcgrath explains why. McGrath also indicated how the KJV influenced American English. Another interesting point, I heard it before, but McGrath emphasizes it, the translators read the translation aloud before they gave it final approval. The KJV was always meant to be read aloud from the pulpit. I think it really shows. Other translations are far more accurate and reads more easily, but no translation surpasses the beauty of the KJV read aloud. The book was almost too short.  I wanted McGrath to delve more into the different topics.     
 Touching Base is a well-researched account of the sport of baseball during its formative years. This book explains how and why baseball became our favorite pastime and how the sport paralleled the life and challenges of  the American people during the first of the twentieth century. Great  comparisons between the myths and the realities of the game 
 Excellent movie, made you feel like you were in the middle of the action. Keeps you on the edge of your seat even when you know the ending 
 If you know who Scratch Acid is, then you shouldn't need any encouragement to buy this - it's basically all of their music on one cd.  If You DON'T know who they are, they were one of the first post-punk American bands (along with Flipper, Big Black, Minutemen etc.).  It's a bunch of kids with nothing much to look forward to, and an uncanny gift for giving chaos a good beat that you can dance to, sometimes.  There're a lot of bourgeois young people who think that playing an acoustic guitar and singing about Joni Mitchell's feelings is "authentic".  I wouldn't know about that; I just know that no one asked these kids to make music, or offered them any money (at first), but they did it anyway 
      Wide Sargasso Sea is an excellent novel. The author, Jean Rhys, tells the story of Antoinette "Bertha" Cosway Mason, the insane wife of Rochester in Jane Eyre. You will learn of Bertha's childhood, honeymoon with Mr. Rochester, and read a short section about her days in Thornfield Hall. The story drags a little in the second part, but overall the story flows very well. If you read and enjoyed Jane Eyre, I believe you will find Wide Sargasso Sea very interesting. 
 I am a native New Yorker - who moved from Manhattan in 1999.  I was back to NYC recently for a visit - and enjoyed some great NY rye bread.  When I returned home - I did a internet search for a local bakery in my hood that could make such yummy rye. The search did not turn up any local bakers within walking distance - but did turn up this book!  So I figured "What the heck - I will make it myself!".    I made the sourdough rye bread - and it is spot on.  The book is excellent for a novice baker and provides such minutia as the proper way to 'fold' a standing pan loaf.    Great reading and great bread.  Much thanks to the author for sharing his expertise with the world.  
 This graphic novel is a wonderful way to tell the stories of operas. Operas have complex plots, bigger than life characters and lots of action. P. Craig Russell captures all of these in his graphic novels 
 There is a quote on the back cover of this book that is very apropos - 'The history of the Church is the history of the Mass,' a statement made by Maria Montessori.  This book shows the Mass, a traditional form of the Mass.  There are certain elements that some parishes will perform differently (this book shows the priests facing the altar; many parish Masses have the celebrant facing the congregation now), but the overall structure of the Mass remains the same.  This is a book intended for children, but the several adults with whom I have shared the book have all found it to be beautifully presented and very accessible.  One person said, 'My mother's book she took to mass was very intimidating to me, but this one makes it look wonderful!'  Her sentiment is one that I echo; while I am trained in liturgy and theology (and thus presume to make a claim on some small understanding of what goes on during the Mass), there are other elements of the service that reach out to people in different ways, touching people in body, mind and spirit.    The visual images throughout the text, which include delightful iconography done by Sister Anna Marie McCormick (derivative of eighth-century icons) and children-oriented illuminations done by Adam Repka (again inspired by Christian imagery throughout history), are simply stunning.  Rich in colour and detail, they serve the original functions of art in the church, which is to be both educational and devotional.  The icons and illuminations tell the story in ways that bare words could never do.  These images are supplementary to photography of acolytes, choristers, congregation and clergy performing their various functions together to celebrate the Mass.    Each section of the Mass is presented in a two-page spread.  The careful reader will notice the Latin headings in white-reverse printing, very subtle, placed near the centre of each spread; the principle heading in English is on the top right, corresponding to the Latin title.  Each section begins with a selection from scripture, and continues with simple explanations about what is happening and why at each point of the Mass.  The graphic imagery includes an angel guiding a boy through the pages; this echoes such imaginative treks as Dante's visionary journey in the Divine Comedy.  The pages are durable and colourful, and should stand up to much use; the book itself is a hardback, in anticipation of children's use that can be a bit rough on books.  This book is useful for following the action in church services as well as explaining things in catechism or personal learning times.    Patmos is new to publishing; this is one of three books currently available (they also have a book on the Rosary and a book for Sunday Evening Vespers).  With books of the quality of this Child's Missal, they cannot help but to grow.  This book is a blessing.   
 This book should be required reading for all American voters, preferably long before the election campaigns of 2008 get underway. Stephen Kinzer is a skilled writer who has done his homework on American efforts at regime change over the last century or so. But he has also written a careful meditation on the American character.  In my estimate, the sooner we Americans give up efforts at regime change, the better. Reading Kinzer's book may help persuade American voters that we should give up these foolhardy adventures abroad 
 This Pink Panther film is the best one that I've seen. I've seen The Pink Panther, A Shot In The Dark, Inspector Clouseau, this one, and The Pink Panther {2006}. It has great slapstick comedy by Peter Sellers and the rest of the cast. Speaking of the cast, here they are. Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, Christopher Plummer as Sir Charles Litton {Lytton}, Catherine Schell as Lady Litton, Herbert Lom as Cheif Inspector Charles Dreyfus, Peter Arne as Colonel Sharky, and of course, Burt Kwouk as my favorite character, CATO. He's awesome! That was my review. Jedi40 
 I first learned of this book when it was mentioned in TIME magazine's article about the French Revolution published at the time of the 200th celebration in July 1989. The words "Totalitarian" and "Democracy" in juxtaposition caught my attention. To a person brought up in the tradition of liberal Western democracy, these words look quite odd together. In the years since I first read Professor Talmon's book, I have used its ideas annually in the World History classes I teach to challenge the students' understanding of the term "Democracy." Just as the People's Republic of China defines Human Rights differently than the West today, so to Robespierre and his fellow members of the Committee of Public Safety who proclaimed "The Reign of Terror" as government policy against their own citizens understood "Democracy" very differently than "we" do. Professor Talmon demonstrates the intellectual origins of Fascism and Stalinism, both of which considered themselves to be forms of "Democracy", as arising during the French Revolution. A short little book of profound significance 
 I think that this was the best one out of all of the Royal Diary seris. I seriously could not put it down when I had too.  
 another album i cant get sick of. very well done, worth every penny 
 this review refers to the Brunettes edition of the 3-book Playboy series:Brunettes,Blondes and Redheads.  the girls in these pages range from the late 50's to the early 70's. i am of the age that the girls from the mid-60's to early 70's are my favorite so this book was just for me and i should think other men who prefer girls from those days.  Playboy girls are always so pretty. sweet smiles. nothing dirty or raw about them.  the girls from this era had no use for implants which i don't even think were around then.  back then, the girls were all natural. and the brunettes in this book are all natural and beautiful......and of course sexy.  i highly recommend this book.  and it's very reasonably priced too. 
 I am thoroughly enjoying this book!  Since i began reading it, i have not been able to put it down, nor have i been able to "shut-up" about the endless intriguing stories within its' pages!    I have found myself thoughtfully speaking to my salads and fruit, thanking them for "nourishing" my body and mind... yep, it has indeed transformed my entire life and gives new meaning to "Sacred Living"...  In a time when we are being faced with the "ecological" question, and the possibility of life beyond our own realm of understanding, this book intrigues and feeds one's own desire to explore ourselves and our "wombniverse" beyond the confines of "3rd"(physical) or "4th" (spiritual) Dimensional thought, and into the "unknown" grander scale of the 5th Dimension...  I highly recommend it to those who seek and desire change, in their thoughts, lives and overall existence.  As a Doctor of Natural Medicine, i always believed in the power and healing of plants, however, now i see them as a source of life that deserves the same nurturing, consideration and love as pets and other so-called "animate" life forms...  Now, on to "Secrets of the Soil"!  Bravo! Peter Tompkins... MORE! MORE! MORE! MORE!!!!  PEACE & BLESSINGS 
 Once again, the authors come up with a great series of books. Would highly recommend any and all dragonlance chronicles. 
 the box was right and works well, and at a distanc 
 Could not stop reading this wonderful book.  It takes you on many trips through humanit 
   Seals & Crofts were an early 1970s outfit that gave us some beautiful songs. The essence of their sound is elegant vocal harmony. The style veers from folkie soft rock to funky blue-eyed soul in the vein of Hall and Oates. Unfortunately the lyrics can be downright trite and twee sometimes, but the melodies make up for that deficiency. I doubt that every track on this album was really a hit: the only songs that made the charts were Summer Breeze, Hummingbird, East Of Ginger Trees, Diamond Girl, We May Never Pass This Way Again and I'll Play For You.  When I Meet Them is a nice singalong number of hippy optimism with a hint of country, whilst Diamond Girl with its tempo variation provides the first example of their gorgeous harmonies and catchy hooks. Hummingbird is a tender and subdued ditty with a spiritual undertone, and East Of Ginger Trees has appealing instrumental passages and eventually rousing vocals, after the first few verses where the vocals remind one of James Taylor.  Another of my favourites is I'll Play For You, a melodious pop ditty with gripping vocals. Ruby Jean And Billy Lee is a sensitive ballad with lovely piano, whilst King Of Nothing is a charming uptempo number. Then comes the highlight of the album and Seals And Crofts' finest achievement: the magnificent Summer Breeze. With its evocative poetic lyrics, impeccable vocals and exquisite arrangement, this song is most enchanting, a real gem.  This duo is considered part of the early 1970s singer-songwriter artists, on the sweeter side. And it is true that some of the sentiments in their lyrics sound very dated, even silly. But there is an undeniable charm in their music. And Summer Breeze is a piece of magic that is worth the price of the album. 
 Funny... crazy... you might want to be sure to watch it first before you buy it... its terrible B movie material but so bad it's actually good 
    This was Shakespeare's final piece of work. He created the character of Prospero in the image of himself. Being the main character, he was toppled in a coup set in his homeland of Milan, was a God-like magician capable of initiating storms and other kinds of magic. By coincidence he saw his enemies in a ship riding towards his island. Where he lived with his daughter Miranda and the native "savage" Caliban.He brought his enemies on his island. And in turn he made them do many interesting things on the island. yet in the end it was all nice and happy, unlike the tragic mood of "Hamlet" or "Romeo and Juliet".      The language was great as usual with all of Shakespeare's great works. Prospero's last lines said also became Shakespeare's last words in terms of writing was concerned. There were plenty of comedy scenes in the play involving the mean spirited native Caliban, who was a servant of Prospero and attempted to rape his daughter, Miranda and later tried to kill him. As the plot went, all became comedies as Prospero saw through everything, the good and the evil, the well planned and the silly.      As many of his contemporaries during the time. Shakespeare despised the natives and saw them as savages. This became clear with Caliban. I found Shakespeare's depictions of him relentless and cruel, almost as if he was describing a pig.       But, overall, the story was very interesting. If you like Shakespeare, then you are sure to like this 
 I had to both laugh at and give a helpful vote to the review below which accused the author of citing half-baked fragments of myths and anecdotes as evidence. To a certain degree, it's a fair cop, particularly if you're looking for a book which is going to really stunningly predict the future.  _The Age of Unreason_ isn't about predicting the future, it's about training yourself to look at the future in ways that you might otherwise not have done. As such, I found it a valuable and interesting book which is clearly based in a lot of meditation on learning and learning theories.   Some of the things Handy mentioned turned out to have become true since the book was written. Other things didn't-- but it doesn't matter ultimately. What the book asks is this: Can you recognize the real causes for pain that you identify? Can you think differently to force discontinuous change? Is your vision of the future based on an accurate perception of the past, or are you looking past major factors because you don't recognize the role of gradual change?  People who like this book may like some of the books on developing strategies using scenario exercises. This book also contains a decent (if dated) bibliography 
 This movie is the second animated feature from the Batman series. As far as movie plot is concerned, Mr. Freeze's wife is on her last leg, some sort of heart failure has put her life in danger. Freeze not being one to be put on a waiting list decides that since there isn't a living donor available, he'll make his own out of a live one, Barbara Gordon. Enter both Batman and Robin(who was either still with the circus or at college in Mask of the Phantasm), step up to stop Freeze.   As far as the animated Batman movies go, I've never truly disappointed, I'm just not a big Mr. Freeze fan. My personal favorite villian is the Joker, but I don't even really consider Freeze a villian up until the Gotham Knights series. He's just an incredibly intelligent man pushed by his world into his current position. However, if you want good animation, and really good story, and Excellent voice acting, then this is your movie.   If you haven't even heard of the animated series, I'd recommend a few episodes first, or Mask of the Phantasm.   'Till Amazon asks me to do this again.   Knight Fo 
    I'm a big "UFO" fan. Have always been. Owned everything on cd except this. I was fortunate enough to find a Japanese gentleman who was willing to airmail me a Japanese pressing. Excellent!                                                     J. Guid 
 Once again, Scott Hahn sets out to motivate Catholics to soak long and often in the Word of God.  And once again, the popular Steubenville professor excites in his readers a heightened appreciation for the Bible's inextricable link to the Church.  Hahn gives an insightful overview of the traditional ways Scripture can be understood, and argues that the Bible must be read with each sense in mind.  In addition to the literal sense, the Bible should be read in the allegorical, moral and anagogical senses as well.  Hahn insists the Bible is best understood only when one integrates all four of these senses.  In what is perhaps the book's most challenging chapter, Hahn explains what he believes to be a "key that unlocks the mysteries of faith... the family of God."   He points out that "the whole of Scripture can be viewed as the story of how God, as Father, repeatedly strives... to draw his wayward children home."  Hahn also includes two chapters about the central importance of Scripture in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas.  In another chapter, he provides a moving tribute to the recently canonized St. Josemaria Escriva and the preeminent place he gave to Scripture in the spiritual life.  Elsewhere, Hahn explains the importance of Jesus' "hour" in John's Gospel, as the culmination of his saving work, as it is re-presented in the Mass. In another chapter that's particularly helpful in current debates about marriage, celibacy and the male priesthood, Hahn offers an insightful look at the priestly vocation of fatherhood and the fatherly vocation of the priesthood.  He ends with a thoughtful critique of currents trends in biblical scholarship.  In each chapter, Hahn's style is accessible to a wide range of readers, yet even seasoned theologians can benefit from his clear and enthusiastic elucidation of the basics of Bible reading for Catholics.  "Scripture Matters" is an invitation to penetrate the mysteries of God's Word more deeply, always within the Living Tradition of the Church.  If it finds the wide readership it deserves, it will succeed in its aim to help Catholics become Bible Christians and Bible Christians to become Catholics.  After all, God's Work is at the heart of the Church; just so, the Church should be at the heart of every Christian 
      I normally avoid the cosmic/heaven-hell/angels-demons stuff like the plague, but the entire Preacher series got such good reviews, I bought the first one. Then the next 4, one-by-one. Then the last four, all at once. This series never gets bogged down in the major cosmic whatnot that seems to be the norm for some series. The characters are great, the storyline is great, and while the art isn't groundbreaking, it fits extremely well for the story.        The only thing that would have made the series better, is if the main character was "Joseph Cohen," and the series was titled "Rebbe" (Rabbi). Everybody knows that yarmulkes and peyes are way cooler than a preacher's collar. Also, the fact that people like Kevin Smith and Penn Jillette write the forewords of this series gives a good indication of what kind of audience would enjoy this. Fantastic stuff 
 This is a very interesting, well written book. I am thoroughly enjoying it.  Modern culture challenges us with tough problems and the solutions are seldom obvious or easy.  Renewing American Culture gives me a solid framework for thinking about these issues and offers great hope for the future.  My only problem is that it would be a richer experience to read Renewing American Culture as part of a book club or group discussion.  It's the kind of book that makes you want to talk about what you're reading 
 my first introduction to post-rock came a few years ago, with Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and after that initial love-affair i searched endlessly for more bands in the same vein.  Many of the GYBE affiliates(a silver mt. zion, fly pan am), as well as others not under the Constellation Records umbrella(mogwai, epxlosions in the sky), but i think i've found my favorite in Do Make Say think.  Their album and song titles may sound about as pretentious as any other post-rock outfit, but that's basically where the prententions end.  With Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn, DMST have created a work of pure post-rock perfection.  Blending elements of jazz with the chamber rock features of label mates Godspeed, but with the perverbial "fat" cut out of the songs, just pure honest songwriting.  You wont find your self fast forwarding through numerous minutes of inaudible ambient noise, no sir, from the upbeat jazzy opener "Fredericia", to the soft, serene closer "Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!", Winter Hymn puts the listener into a state of post-rock haaven, and once the final notes of "Hooray!(x3)" play out, you'll be begging for more, I know I was.  this is a band that plays for the sheer love of music.  This is a band that is helping to make the music industry a better place.  This album is a must have for ANY post-rock fan, but also worth looking in to for those of you who have never even heard the term "post-rock" in your life.  Invest the simple $12 on this album, and let it move you 
 This book has a lot of informations on what to eat and what to avoid based on your blood types.... I have just speed read through it once, but I am going to reread it again...it does make a lot of sense about my blood type though..like what food I am supposed to avoid...I find the info quite useful..if you are new to the blood type diet as I am, you might want to try to borrow this book from your local library first before you buy it...a book worth reading. 
 Normally adult fiction and non fiction authors Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson have again teamed up with illustrator Greg Call for their second voyage into the world of children's books. Peter and the Starcatchers was a prequel to J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan and this sequel to that prequel picks up the story where that great novel left off.    Peter Pan has become a bit arrogant on the island Neverland, constantly tormenting his arch nemeses Black Stache by dropping coconuts and mangos on his head and teasing him with a new insult, Captain Hook due to what happened in the last book.   After his friend James is captured by Stache and subsequently rescued by a very disappointed Fighting Prawn, Peter promises he will grow up, (well of course he can't) but he will act more mature anyway.   Unbeknownst to Peter and Prawn, whilst they were distracted dealing with the consequences of Peters immaturity, a new enemy has infiltrated their island named Ombra, who has brought with him another of Peter's arch enemies Slank, who wants nothing more than to kill Peter and have his vengeance.  Ombra wants the chest full of starstuff that Peter and Molly previously fort to protect, but of course Molly's father has already taken it back to England for the Return.  Ombra has the advantage of not being human and the ability to steal people's shadows reducing the victims to be his forever in a zombie state slave.  In pursuit of the stardust Ombra now has his sights on Molly and her mother back in London and Peter will of course do anything to protect Molly.  A jealous Tinker Bell accompanies Peter to London where upon learning about a boy called George, Tinker Bell will not be the only one with jealous feelings. It is up to Peter and Molly to once again prevent the starstuff from ending up in the hands of evil.   This novel does rely on the reader having read the former Peter and the Starcatchers first to fully understand the depths of the story but even without having read that novel first you will certainly still enjoy this great adventure.  Barry and Pearson have certainly written a more action packed adventure this time round where of course children are the main heroes.  Read both books, they are sensational!  Can't wait for the next instalment, Escape from the Carnivale. Check out the adult fiction of both authors as well!                  
 This is one of the best books in the VSI series, and I've read well over thirty by now. It gives a very good introduction to the basic neuroanatomy of the brain, and explains many important brain functions. The book is intended for laypeople, but even those (like me) who are familiar with the subject can benefit from reading it. Oftentimes neuroscience textbook overwhelm with details, and it is sometimes hard to see the forest from the trees. This book provides a good bird's eye perspective on the field, and its many references and recommended books make it a valuable reference. Very importantly, the book is up to date in some of the more recent discoveries, including some current controversies like grandma neuron, the idea that the brain has a neuron devoted just for recognizing each family member.  A good, well written and well organized book. I highly recommend it. 
 The book is more like a portfolio of Michaels work with a running monolouge from the photographer about each image. It is almost like you are sitting with him reviewing his portfolio as he tells you the background behind each image.  The book was oddly arranged and you had to flip back and forth between text & images, but it was well written and the images were awesom 
 This is a very touching and meanigful film about friendship and love.  One of the most important facts I like about this film is NO STEREOTYPES.  It's not the club scene or drugs,sex and not everyone is a queen.  It is a group of adult men who get together and share their lives.  Think of it as the gay "BIG CHILL".  One deals with loneliness and aids, two committed relationships go through infidelity and the stuggles of forgiveness.  Two gay brothers come to terms with their relationship.  The acting is well done especially John Glover who plays both brothers.  I highly recommend this.  Another film I recommend is "Broken Hearts Club" about a group of younger men going through their journey. 
 This book accomplishes two quite different things, both of which should be of use to the committed investor.  First of all, it sets forth an investment philosophy in great detail.  Second, it shows investors how to analyze securities themselves.  In both those respects, it is on a par with "Securities Analysis" by Graham and Dodd (also highly recommended - I have also reviewed that book), although it is a much easier read.  In setting forth an investment philosophy, the book compares well with "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits" by Phil Fisher and "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamen Graham (both recommended).  Whereas Fisher emphasized growth companies and management analysis and Graham emphasized earnings, Whitman and Shubik emphasize low price/book ratios.  They support their position quite ably with examples and , where available, studies.  The Aggressive Conservative Investor also contains a good bit of information about securities analysis.  While it is not as in-depth as "Security Analysis" (the Graham and Dodd classic), the chapters on financial accounting and GAAP are a must read, particularly since the book convincingly demonstrates that the utility of financial statements will differ depending upon the position of the person reviewing them.  Whitman and Shubik are most certainly value investors who focus on analyzing a particular company (as compared to the market as a whole, interest rate trends, etc.), although they also cover "asset conversion investing," which may involve investing in distressed companies.  They make an excellent argument that, in many cases, companies with unencumbered assets may make excellent investments.  They also freely take exception to accounting conventions that emphasize earnings, and they repeatedly demonstrate how earnings may be affected by accounting policies that are beyond the control (and arguably the understanding) of most investors, including me.  Another interesting thing about this book is that it covers different corporate constituancies (banks, bondholders, management, insurance companies, passive outside shareholders, etc.) and how their involvement affects and is affected by corporate activities in great detail.    The book notes that even investors in common stock may have different objectives, and it discusses how these perspectives may affect the company over time.  The book also has an excellent discussion of sources of corporate disclosure, in order to take advantage of the company's public communications to understand it better.  While I am generally aware of many of these sources, the book does a commendable job of explaining them in greater detail.  The Aggressive Conservative Investor does contain some numeric analysis that may be hard to follow, and it can't be called an "easy read," although it certainly is not as hard to read as "Security Analysis."  Moreover, some of the information contained in the book is now outdated due to changes in the tax code.  These are minor concerns to me, however, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about investing 
 The Fundamentals of Trading Energy Futures & Options was one the best business books I've read. It was easy to read and understand. The book is well written and earned its cost in my first hour of trading. I highly recommend this book 
 This is not a diet book but a scientific look by a Harvard researcher at dietary choices and how they affect us 
 Great fun. Dickens' first novel, the first mass-market best seller in world history (coming on the heels of the invention of cheap paper). Essential reading for Victorian Literature and the evolution of Dickens' style. This edition (with footnotes and introduction, two appendices and maps) is fine in all respects, except that the print is too small 
 I'll admit, I was not crazy about this one at first but my child loved it from the beginning. This is a great way to expose your kids to music and a number of different instruments beyond drums, guitar and piano. I highly recommend it 
 Buena Vista Social Club is more a coffee table addition than a serious  in-depth study, but will prove a 'must' for any prior fan of the Buena  Vista Social Club and Cuban music in particular. Photos, film stills and  text accompany first-person capsule sketches by the participants of the  BVSC group in this companion book to the film 
 I found a copy of this book for $5 at a "publisher's outlet" store and went back to buy the other two to give as gifts.  Although it is a scholarly collection of ethnographic studies, I found it an inspiring description of people who manage to live outside the mainstream of "social norms."  All the essays were touching and moving.   I especially liked "Brothers Orphans: Images of Equality Among the Hungarian Rom" by Michael Stewart and "A Contest with Money..." by Evthymios Papataxiarchis.  These stories are a reminder, and a question, of the central values of freedom, wealth, and autonomy that we all face, but few of us are really aware of 
 its educational because it helps kids love animals and value them too. that way they'll grow up to help the enviorment and animals. they are very fun to have in the pool. they are even more fun with the rainbow reef fish too 
 2 Years to a Million in Real Estate by Matt Martinez is a great book for any real estate investor looking to buy their first rental property as well as more seasoned investors looking to grow their portfolio. This book not only describes how Matt made the jump working day in and day out at a Technology Firm to complete Financial Independence, he also tells you how you can do it and what to look out for! Great book that leaves me excited and pumped up to go and acquire more properties!! Thanks Matt!   PS: When is your next Book coming out? :^ 
 Anyone or thing that can keep my son happy is a marvel, and this album along with his Rise Against one has done just that! 
 AND THEN YOU DIE was the first Iris Johansen mystery/suspense book that I read and to say that I enjoyed it would be an understatement. This is definitely a "stop light book" (for my definition of a "stop light book" please see my review on THE UGLY DUCKLING by Iris Johansen). I couldn't put this book down. As a side note, I have to tell you that the reason for this title will become clear about half way through the book and then you'll stop thinking of it as a strange name!  AND THEN YOU DIE is about group of people threatening to destroy the world with chemical warfare and photojournalist Bess Grady stumbles into the testing grounds with her sister. Grady is a photojournalist and is assigned to photograph a small village in Mexico.  When they arrive at the village, they find that all of the people are dead, except for a baby. Bess leaves her sister as she goes for help and is knocked unconscious by soldiers arriving in decontamination suits. She awakens to find herself in a hospital bed and her sister has disappeared. Now she must trust someone whom she believes is one of the murderers in order to save her life and that of the baby she has rescued.  Sounds like a typical synopsis from most suspense books, right? With Iris Johansen writing it, you can bet on anything but typical. I enjoy mysteries of all kinds and being the avid bibliophile that I am, I can usually figure out the bad guy in an excellent mystery around the middle point in the book. I may be able to figure out the villain in Johansen's books, but I can't grasp the entire scheme of things. Another thing that I enjoy about her books is that there are no clear cut bad guys/good guys, after all aren't we all a mixture? If I had to use one word to describe both her characters and her books it would be "complex".  This is another author who has crossed genres from romance to mystery/suspense and has done so with a flare that few can match. Describing her work as excellent is not an embellishment and doesn't do this book justice. I've given my copy of this book to a few friends who have become avid Johansen fans after reading it. They did lose sleep in order to finish the story, but didn't seem to hold it against me for suggesting the book in the first place (and then they asked if I had any other books by her!). 
 First serialized in 1859, and then published as a novel in 1860, The Woman in White, by Wilkie Collins, tellingly, has never been out-of-print since the time of our Civil War.  Considered the world's first detective novel, it is a richly-phrased and atmospheric page-turner that, in a complicated and rather unique fashion, reveals its mystery slowly, even luxuriously, through the testimonies of a host of memorable characters, such as the capable Marian Holcombe, and her nemesis, one of literature's more intriguing creations, the suave villain, Count Fosco.   Weighing in at a hefty 600-plus pages, The Woman in White may appear daunting to some; but the pairing of Collins' writing, which is often sublime, and his method of story-telling, which is always interesting, should, if given the chance, prove a winning-combination to most.  Also recommended: The Moonstone, by Wilkie Collins; The Winter Queen, by Boris Akunin; Gaston Leroux's The Mystery of the Yellow Room, and The Perfume of the Woman in Black; Caleb Carr's The Alienist, and The Angel of Darkness; Rennie Airth's River of Darkness, and The Blood-Dimmed Tide 
 This comedian is amazing... One of the funnest I have ever see. He is definately one of the best, If you havent bought this yet than you definately need to go get it. Big 5 out of 5 for Jummy Gaffigan 
 I enjoyed this book because of the suggestions for chronically ill people and also the many people in the book who wrote a personal page or 2 about their experience with chronic illness. There were alot of correlations between people who have different chronic illnesses it felt good to know that there are people out there like myself. I would suggest this book for anyone who has to deal with a chronic illness 
 My 3 year old son loves this book.  The story is easy to follow and has that repetitive style that small children love.  The battle between the sneeky bunnies and Mr McGreely is great, and builds to a very amusing ending.  I have read this story every night now for the past 3 months and I am sure that I will be reading it for at least another 3 - Muncha, Muncha, Muncha 
 This has been the single biggest book to impact my life next to the Bible! I have read several books on healing prayer and touch. And how to help and pray for others. This book has, and I wasn't even expecting it, helped me the most! It has opened my eyes to total healing and how we can be healed in so many other ways than just physcially. I wish everyone would read this book. And no I don't make any money on this book. Every minister especially, should have and read this book 
 I have a LOT of books and magazines full of plans for all sorts of things, but this one really stands out.  So many quick easy projects you run across out there are for things that are outdated or are just plain dumb.  This book is different - - the plans are for things that are actually useful and good-looking, things you'll want to make, and be proud of.  As soon as I got the book I proceeded to make a bunch of the photo stands as Christmas gifts.  There are some really simple items that can be made with a minimum of tools, and others that will be of interest to those with a shop full of power tools.  These projects are especially great for those times when you don't want to spend several weeks building something.  They're just fun projects that only require a day or two to complete, with a minimum amount of wood and expense.  I highly recommend this book 
 This is a small 133 page paperback book that is loaded with ideas for using notebooks to improve your or your student's writing. There are interesting comments from other writers as well as from the author, Ralph Fletcher, noted author of writing books.  Fletcher encourages us to "write small" and capture all the little details using a writer's notebook. There, we should put descriptions of hands, gestures, objects, and anecdotes that we observe throughout our days.  The author lists many ways to use these notebooks in this small book, making it easy to read yet very helpful.  Highly recommended to any writer.  John Dunbar Sugar Land, T 
 The first four full sentences on page 138 of the 1990 hardcover alone are almost too bleeding good. And what about Hector freaking out on the table in Bodhi Dharma Pizza, with his priceless put-down of the night manager? Or Prairie commandeering the kitchen in the retreat of the Sisterhood of Kunoichi Attentives and heading into the freezer for the glowing Variety Loaves? Vato and Blood driving at night to the theme from Psycho? The colossal dopechunk in Zee Dubya's house?! Echoes of absquatulation??!! Well I could go on but let me just say instead that this wonderful book has as much astonishing writing in it as anything else Mister Pynchon--God bless him--has produced. Reading through the opinions here it surprises me that so many people don't get Vineland, but then again maybe it shouldn't.  Get a load of this: My comments here are dated April 5th, a Wednesday, but actually I didn't put in the last bit until two days later, Friday the 7th. So there I am right, later that night watching telly in bed with one eye and re-reading the funny bits in the book under review with the other when what comes on at 11.30 but the episode of The Simpsons where Homer is fired by Mr. Burns and gets a job as a salesman in Boris' Car Loft. Meanwhile Marge writes a racy whaling novel called The Harpooned Heart which is a smash with the locals. The character based on Homer goes for a pint in Moab's--I love that. Then things go sideways for a while because who suddenly shows up and phones in a blurb but Old Ruggles himself, and not just a picture of him either, his actual voice too. I couldn't believe it, I was looking at a cartoon version of Thomas Pynchon and hearing his real New York accent! He was wearing a brown paper bag over his head, presumably to conceal his features and maintain his usual anonymity. Mindblown I was--this being a Friday night remember--and only too happy to concede that this piece of theatre put my own finishing touches in the outhouse, to semi-quote myself and steal yet again from the great Charles Portis, who everybody should read too.  But just one more thing and then I'll shut my yap: It seems to me that whenever Zoyd Wheeler stumbles into view in this novel the writing becomes especially focused, lively, funny and, well, tender. I could be wrong here but I'm guessing Mister Pynchon really likes this dude and his affection translates into some of Vineland's most unforgettable prose. Take the chapter where Zoyd flies to Honolulu to check up on Frenesi as a for instance: the descriptive passages here, full of looping, intricate sentences, deliver up the pathos and hard comedy of his plight to perfection. The dialogue zips along too and Zoyd even gets to crack a Steve McGarrett joke. As I said, it's easy to see where Mister Pynchon's sympathies lie and you can't help rooting for the frazzled ol' dope fiend. Hapless, dishevelled, a little windblown and feckless maybe but basically honest, Zoyd is the unsung heart of this great novel. His charm for me, aside from the fact that he named his dog Desmond and isn't above retrieving smokable butts from the night before, is that he is the only character here who doesn't seem to be motivated by some compelling social or political reason, he just rolls with the punches as best he can. Who needs compelling reasons anyway? They just make your face pointy 
 Frank Abagnale Jr. stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time. The story is inflated at times (in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner, a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with). Still, the Catch Me If You Can is engaging, and Abignale's scams combine inventiveness and good humor. Enjoy 
 The program is nice the first time through, but the demonstrator adds so much commentary that you have to fastforward extensively whenever you use the dvd to perform the program.  
   If you like thrillers this movie is great.  It seems a little dated now but the acting and characters are rich and the plot is interesting 
 I admit that the Titanic movie of 1997 made a big change in my Titanic collecting - mainly before that time I had only about 5 books.  One of the books I had was an original from 1912 that was produced due to the fact that there was no radio, Internet or CNN to blast the news into your daily lives.   Only the newspapers carried the story and people wanted to know more.   Needless to say, the movie got a lot of people interested in the subject (as it always seems to do whenever a new movie gets produced)  Due to this interest all sorts of books got re-published and published for the first time.   I started to collect and read and read and read.   I was always interested in the many points of debate that continue on and on, but this book seemed to make so much sense because it aligned with those things that I had read and had questions about but that never really got answered.  There were several reports of iceberg sightings, before the ship hit. There was a report that the alarm bell was rung three times, not three sounds but three different times for three different icebergs. Why did Murdock keep going when they entered the ice field?   All the other reasons didn't quite hold up. This author gives forth a logical answer.  The idea that the iceberg grazed along the side of the ship didn't really seem to answer how the ship could go down so fast, the author of this book explains how the ship could have hit.  Not only does his explanation make sense but it aligns with the other eye witness accounts of that night.  The list goes on.  I can only say that it is well worth the read, and I currently have 58 Titanic related books and have talked and talked to other historians who have their theories.  This is a really good book.

 Good story. Good pictures. Why not...it sure beats the cookie-cutter superheroes and the way he uses his power is niffty. AND he can balance the budget too 
 I like many other people that bought this album were expecting a bunch of SNAP music. i like the song "do it to it" dont get me wrong but i thought this album would be a CD full of songs just like that but suprisingly there are some songs on there that will appeal to grown folks as well. let me say that after a  single that did not get much air time(miss p) and a shelved album in 2003 i didnt think wed ever see these girls again but they found their luck with jazzy pha. they have the style of girls their age but @ the same time they have the sophistication to draw attention from the more mature crowd.  younger crowd -----------------                                                                      that boi                                  DO IT TO IT                                 chevy                                       taken                                       ooh                                         check like me                                    older crowd ----------    fool for you unappreaciated stop calling me show and tell moment in time(love this track, their vocals sound soo good together) whenever(another one of my favorites on the album.. makes you feel like u back in the 90s listeing to a TLC album)                                                   
 I first heard Hunt Lieberson only a few months ago, and was immediately moved by her voice and musicianship.  These Bach Cantatas display an emotional and spiritual range and intensity that is at times unbearable. Her tragic personal story - she died recently after a struggle with cancer - lends an uncanny quality to the way she sings of suffering, despair and hope. The words never before held such depth. A profound experience 
 It would be tempting these days to dismiss Nesbit's Edwardian chestnut as sappy and sentimental; however, upon rereading it, I find this is simply not the case. Sure, there is innocent charm aplenty in this tale of three children whose father is mysteriously called away. The family (Roberta, the eldest girl and main character, Peter, and Phyllis) go with their mother to live in the country, and while mother tries to make ends meet by writing stories, the children explore the area, make friends with people at the train station and on the passing train, and involve themselves in a couple of daring rescues. Each chapter is like its own little adventure, but always there lingers the question of where has father gone, and how will the family pull through its crisis. Sunny the author's outlook may be, but it is not sentimental, as evidenced when the children throw a surprise party for Perks the porter and he is angered rather than glad, fearing they do it our of charity. The children fight amongst themselves, and worry, and fret, like real children of that or any era might. Throughout the story, the reader comes to enjoy this country town and its cast of ordinary but amusing characters. The story's ending is actually very moving in its simple way. A classic 
 Thank you very much for your review Earl Hartman. You are the translator of a better book on Zen and you practice!! Wow. And you still have the EGO to mention your ACCOMPLISHMENTS. So we are to believe Herrigel is the one who didnt get it?? Is it the point to 'get it'? Is there a point? I think we can now disregard anyone who gives this book less than 4 stars.    Herrigel may have 'gotten it,' maybe not. You must experience Zen to know it. And when you know it you know it. HIS conclusions do not make the reader a Zen master.      Whatever. This book is fun. His writing style is fun. His master is fun.    And he is from the West. How could he write in any other way than a Western one? So this book will really speak to Westerners. Brought up with Christianity and dualisms etc etc, this book is written for us. We can relate pretty well to his 'shortcomings' and all his questioning.   Do not follow the supposed experts. Just read.        
 I have been a fan of the Walt Disney World With Kids series for several years.  We have three children and visit Disney World regularly, so I've been in the parks with everything from newborns to teenagers.  I have always found the advice in the book to be accurate and practical - it's clear the author has children herself and is speaking with plenty of "real world" experience.  In contrast to the other Disney books on the market, I find this guide to be the most realistic in terms of how much you can actually expect to see and do when traveling with children.  The comparisons of Disney hotels are especially helpful (we've tried several over the years and have found the book's descriptions to be right on the money) as are the "scare factor" ratings for various attractions.  All in all, this is a travel guide that is definitely worth the money 
 A great book for appreciating the various outlets of current Star Wars fandom.  While offering little serious academic discourse, the book does put into print many issues which to this point have been limited to internet discussion and fan zines, such as LFL's strict licesing enforcement, the culture of message board discussion, fan fiction and films.  In the end it stands as an interesting catalog of current happenings in the world of Star Wars fandom, as seen from an insider who respects the devotion of a unique community 
 This book is a history of algebra for the mathematically inclined.  For the rest of us, it is an amusing collection of the personalities of the algebraists who have graced our world.  Though I have an undergraduate degree in mathematics, and have had an interest in mathematics ever since, I found some of this kind of heavy going.  Naturally I just skipped some of the more arcane stuff to get to the good parts.    Derbyshire writes very lucidly even when the subject is pretty arcane, but his real strength is in the breadth of his research.  A lot of this was new to me, and fascinating.  A recurrent theme running through the book is the advances made in the notation used to express numbers and algebraic ideas.  The clarity and brevity of modern notation compared to that used even in medieval times is pretty amazing.    I always get a nice warm feeling after reading a book like this--the sense that humanity can, after all, make progress happen, at least in some spheres, holds a special fascination.  Quite a contrast with any contact with today's newspaper, with its recurring accounts of criminal activity in the political elite.  This seems to never change, nor does there seem to be much hope of it ever changing.  This book can lift you up and make you a better person for having read it.  Not bad 
 "Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, & the Deadliest Hurricane in History," Erik Larson, NY, Vintage, 2000  ISBN: 0-375-70827-8, SC, 323/273 pgs., Notes 31 pgs., 7 pg. Biblio, 7 pg. Index, 8" x 5 1/8"  This is author Larson's 3rd. of 4 books, & herein he writes with meticulous stype a chronicle of America's most devastating storm, the Galveston 1900 hurricane that caused over 8,000 deaths.  Well-researched, based on archived materials, he inserts masterful fluent prose as he recounts the Galveston affair from viewpoint of resident U.S. Weather Bureau meteorologist, Isaac Cline (& family), of an unrecognized storm which defied existing rules & pounced upon a busy, bustling city totally unprepared for its near-total devastation: - a storm born, perhaps, of "non-linear dynamics."  The jerky writing manner, at times appearing non sequitur,  actually embellishes his story-telling style.  It orchestrates fervid glimpses of erratic events registering splashes of waves, rising tides, salvos of destructive winds all causing dwellings to be torn & made topsy-turvy & then submerged whilst families within sought sanctuary in crowed upper rooms knocked asunder, wtih peoples, pets, animals including toad-frogs, snakes all engulfed in rising waters amidst surf & cyclonic winds during an otherwise not too unusual, hot-humid Saturday afternoon.  The reader gains considerable insight into those forces of Nature which make up a storm & of the reliance people have come to place upon weather forecasting.  Whichever way, "Isaac's Storm" or "Isaac's blunder", it's an excellent read 
 First, let me say that I am a very independent, very headstrong, liberal wife who has a higher education than her husband (masters' degree), owns a business and takes no B.S. from anyone.  When this book came out, I truly thought it was a joke.  WHO WOULD WRITE A BOOK LIKE THIS OUTSIDE OF THE 1950s?!  And WHERE IS THE "PROPER CARE... OF WIVES"?!  To add 'insult', a coworker of my husband (whose wife stays at home with their 4 kids because they feel that this is THE role wives are SUPPOSED TO take on), is the one who offered to lend it to me.  I thought, "this will be interesting" but can't criticize until giving it a shot, right???  Ok - there's the background - here's the review:  I couldn't put the book down and read it in a just over a day.  While I don't agree 100% with all that Dr. Laura says, and as another reviewer commented that there are parts that men may find insulting, this book has changed my life, and as a result it has changed my husband's life - both for the better.  After 7 years of marriage, we are clicking like we never have before.  I can't explain it to you, or to my married best friends whose jaws dropped as I confessed to them over margaritas that I NOT ONLY READ the book but I LOVED the book.    All I can say is that the foundation makes sense.  It doesn't bash working women - Dr. Laura is one, after all.  But it does point out, not so discreetly, that your family - the family you have chosen to create - should come above all else.  And that the EXTREMISM of some aspects of the feminist movement is self-destructive to women, men and society as a whole.  And as I turned each page and as I tried to rebel against some parts (I shouldn't BURDEN him with the tales of MY day??!), peel away the layers, let down your defenses and let it make sense.  (It isn't that my day is less significant, but men and women communicate differently - vent to him about your day and he'll feel like a second class citizen and a failure for not being able to fix your stress.  Vent to your girlfriends and they'll dish with you!  Focus your time on your husband, family, relationship, etc., once you get home instead.)  AND LET ME TELL YA once you leave the work day at the door, your home becomes YOUR HOME again, too.  So it's win-win!  REALLY!!!  Dr. Laura's book includes parts and pieces of past calls and letters, which is a helpful, practical demonstration of her points and breaks things up so you don't feel like you're getting a lecture (especially if you are ready to admit you've been doing a few thngs wrong!).  And as you can see the lightbulb go on with average Janes all over the country and across time in the dialogue- from them pushing back on her advice to (aha!) getting her message during their conversations, you see the pettiness we can cling to and frankly, the underlying simplicity in each of her messages.  OK - still skeptical? Then rent it at the library for free and give it a shot.  Just TRY to put her ideas into practice - commit to changing for a week (if you aren't sold on changing your life)... What's the worst that can happen?  If it's all wrong for you, you have just lost a quick week and you can pat yourself on the back for being right and you can write your own book. ;-)  But just think - what if it WORKS?!  Then you will find a new meaning in your life that you didn't know you were missing.  You will have a much happier and rewarding marriage.  Your husband will adore you.  (Sounds rough, huh?)    TRUST ME - I'm not about to become a submissive, mindless person rather than an equal partner in a relationship.  But as I made a few MINOR tweaks in how I treat the man I chose to marry and spend the rest of my life with, I have received rewards from him 10-fold.  And to think I thought I was doing it 'right' all along. ;0)    
 There is times when sometimes i don't have the time to watch movies or read books.One time one of my friends had let my sister barrow this movie, and she sat there and watched it. My friend had asked her if she like it, and she said she loved it so for a while that's all they talked about. I felt left out becuase i had nothing to say about it so they convinced me to watched it. So i finally seen the movie and i loved it, I have to say it's one of the best movies ever. A couple of months later i read the book it was a very similar, but also had some big differences. I also thought that the book was good book, and the characters were great. F.X Toole is a excellent arthor I liked the way he wrote all the little stories in the book "Million Dollar Baby" he wrote things that made me want to keep reading to know what i wanted to know. He made the story so realistic that it hit me, and even made me cry. I liked how he made Maggie (a girl) a great fighter that shows that a girl can always do anything if they really try. Maggie had a sad life, and i loved the way how she didn't let her bring her down she always kept trying. She always had Boss, and others that cared for her, and was there to help her out. I have to say F.X Toole did a great job 
 I just passed the exam, and this book was an important method of study for me.  There are quite a few pragmatic examples regarding security and various standards and questions that will help on the exam, and just increase a general understanding of Windows Server 2003 security 
 Great Graphs and Sensational Statistics really made our 6th Grade Business Math unit very fun and interesting.  While charting commercials, dangling spoons, taking surveys, flipping coins and following the stock market...we learned all about how to present information in a form that others can understand.    This is very REAL math that my child can use throughout his life - whether he's a weatherman, scientist, or business administrator!  We all need to learn how to present information clearly and effectively.    Oh, and some statistical work is in there - means, medians, conducting a study and charting statistical results...highly recommended 
 This is the first E.M. Forester book I've read and it affected me greatly. When I write 'reviews', I don't mean to give a traditional book review, but to note how the book affected my real life.     This is how:  One of the characters, Cecil, is a bit of a snob and looks down on the common homey interests of his betrothed's family.  He is good with books,art, ideas and 'things', but when he interacts with real people, his personality 'kills' any chance of having an intimate relationship and thus, his life is one of ideas rather than people.  How fiction unwraps itself and reveals itself to be true!  This was looking into a mirror for me.  What my friends won't tell me, a good novel will!  Doing well with "books, ideas and things" is not the epicenter of living, says Forester, but the nitty gritty give and take of affectionate living is where life's eruption takes place.  Art and ideas and books, although glorious, arise from this center, not vice versa. First comes the flesh, then the idea.  Thus this 'old' book, written over 100 years ago, performs the magic of all good literature:  it makes me act and think differently.  I now, attempt to(!), treat the person who stands before me, not as an idea, but as another real, carbon-based life form!   "A Room With A View" tells the often told story of a young person learning to stand in her own place rather than where society demands she stand, yet Forester's characters are so complete that this old story is like a skeleton that is dressed up in finery and begins to walk!  I fell in love with the characters and recognized myself in all of them; yes, even in the old biddy Charlotte, who, as it turns out, wasn't so old fashioned and possibly was the master puppeteer.    
 This is a well-written story combining the elements of a political/spy novel with those of a Greek tragedy.  Set in Argentina, Greene tells the tale of a botched political kidnapping which provides the context for an interesting character study.  The ineptitude of Greene's kidnappers and their gradual self-destruction, to me, symbolized the disarray and tumult in the lives of each character.  Greene's interesting cast of characters includes a chameleon-like prostitute who tailors her personality to accommodate the varying expectations and inadequacies of her clients, a fallen priest who cannot seem to shed his former skin, a marginalized novelist who is crippled by his pride, an emotionless doctor whose heart is as sterile as his instruments, and an inconsequential "honorary" consul who fails at everything except loving.  This novel is by no means cheery, but I came away from it with an important reminder that life is lived in vain if lived without having loved--even if that love is unrequited 
 I'm really looking forward to getting the impact level 4 I ordered at the same time as this one, because the level 2 is fantastic.  This sports bra offers support, and style.  I've worn it jogging three times and it feels great.  No bounce and no pinching.  It held up great in the washing machine and dried really quickly.  Everything I've tried before this wonderful bra was way too flimsy and offered no support.  For years I've been looking for something that would hold everything in place while I ran a few miles and jogged up and down a few sets of stairs.  I think I'll get one of each support level and then I'll get one more of each.  It even has adjustable hooks in the elastic band around the chest, so as you lose those Lbs while wearing this great top, you'll be able to adjust it to fit you as you slim down.  I'll never have to search high and low again.  I'll know exactly where to turn whenever I need a sports bra that will support my "needs".  Thank you Figleaves, you really have a great product.  I hope that enough women find that these sports bras are a godsend and that we'll never have to wear ugly, cumbersome, pinching nightmares again 
 A doctor uses a serum on his nurse, Jane (Beverly Garland) to get her to re-live a trauma she has no memory of. A very strange tale emerges: When her husband Paul disappears on their honeymoon, Jane traces him to a Louisiana plantation deep in the swamps where no one will tell her what happened to him. She insists on staying and discovers Paul is around but can't find him. Why? Because mad doctor George Macready is performing bizarre experiments with alligators (and people) and Paul is turning into an alligator!  Lon Chaney Jr. co-stars as a hook-handed assistant with a hatred for "gaters" because one bit off his hand and Frieda Inescourt ("Return of the Vampire") is the mistress of the plantation trying to cover up the awful horrors as Garland gets more and more inquisitive. There's Deep South atmosphere to spare and creepy crawlies in the swamp as Garland runs around screaming. She's good as Jane and really put through the mill here. Obviously, this is no classic but it's a fun 50's creature feature for collectors with laughable make-up effects and a fun turn by Chaney Jr. with that hook-hand. No wonder Jane developed amnesia after this experience...when you see the "alligator-man" you'll know why. Gotta love it 
 Several years ago, one of the best leaders I know, someone who managed to rise to the top of every organization he was ever in --including the one he currently works for, told me the secret to his success. "Think like a leader," he said. I've often meditated on his words. I've discovered that they are absolutely true...  In his book, Maxwell explains how you can leverage the power of your thoughts to acheive unthinkable success: He gives you all the different ways leaders think and then shows you how to do it yourself. Just like my friend said: "Think like a leader." Order this book and find out how. 
 Miles is the man.  He is my musical hero.  "I'll Remember  April", is the best one on this CD.  I am  a trumpet prodigy, at age  thirteen, and right now I'm a Miles Davis disciple 
 Things Fall Apart has been described as Africa's "best-loved novel", read widely not only in Nigeria where it was written in 1958, but across the entire African continent in schools; it is studied and taught in Europe in North America where 100s of papers and dozens of major studies have been written about it; it is said that in Australia and India it is the only African novel that most people know about. It has been called the archetypal modern African novel written in English.  The novel is about an African tribe along the Niger River that experiences British colonialism around the turn of the 20th century. The first 2/3's of this short novel establish the customs and day to day themselves the tribe, focusing on one man and his family in particular, known as Okonkwo. Into this arrive the "white men" who begin to change things, "things fall apart" leading ultimately to Okonkwo's death. The novel is not a "black and white" story of heroes and villains, of romanticized old-world customs destroyed by "modernity" and evil Europeans - the old customs had good and bad points, the British had good and bad points - even the hero of the novel, Okonkwo, is fairly unlikeable in many respects. This sense of balance throughout the novel, how everything has both good and negative aspects, gives it a great deal of believability and instruction.  Although we learn a lot about the specifics of the Ibo-speaking people along the Niger (historically accurate as Achebbe was born into that culture) the novel transcends the tribe, even Africa. It provides a realistic window into what it was like for tribal people who are globalized into western culture - from North American Indians in the age of Columbus, to present-day Amazonian first-contact tribes 
 The fringe economy is a poorly-understood shadow structure operating below the surface of maintstream life, according to Karger, a professor of Social Work in Texas.  His outlook is more broad than deep, but I applaud both the scope of his work and his policy recommendations.  While I would disagree with a few of them (as an economist I have a slightly different perspective of the function of financial institutions), the suggested policy actions offer a launching point for further discussion that is missing in some other purely emotive works.  I also applaud Karger's effort to tackle this fairly ethereal subject (much like the idea of the 'economy' itself) and put it into human terms.  I knock one star for the presentation of statistics - there's a little too much of it without enough order to support their presentation.  However, these do not detract from the logic of the book, only from the continuity in a few sections.  Otherwise, an eye-opening read 
 Reading the Museum Guard reminded me of the work of Roald Dahl, whom I'd read as a child.  The author, Howard Norman, has a knack for creating characters that are awkward and strange, yet strangely familiar.  Between the wide eyed appeal of the narrator, Defoe Russet, and the ne'er do well of his uncle, Norman has created an instant classic that will harken adult readers back to a time when reading Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Danny, The Champion of the World were at the top of their summer reading list. 
 The book looks wonderful - but it came without the patterns.  I would suggest that you ask the seller to double check the book to make sure the patterns are included before shipping 
 Don't give up on an author because you had a traumatic experience in high school when you were forced to read books without any say!  Try F. Scott Fitzgerald in "Pat Hobby".  This series of short stories are easy  to put down and pick up and can introduce you to his style of writing  without you having to write an essay about it!  Give it a whirl 
 Finally, I think someone has gotten through to me to get me to eat healthier.  The motivation?  Avoiding cancer and other diseases.  Dr. Slaga breaks it down simply: some foods cause cancer, while others help prevent it.  Which would you rather eat?  He itemizes the different vitamins, minerals, supplements etc. that fight disease, and explains how they work within the body to do so.  He provides a list of "super foods," the foods that are the absolute best for you, so you can concentrate on those if you'd like.  And he provides a bunch of recipes incorporating his recommended foods so you can work them into your lifestyle.  This is not a diet book!  This is a book that can help you live a healthier and longer life, if you just listen to Dr. Slaga's message.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.  Since I read this book, I have been incorporating items like soy, flaxseed oil, fish oil, nuts and dried fruits, etc., into my diet, and I look forward to reaping the results 
 Very good movie enjoyable and funny VERY FUNNY, if you are or aren't a soccer fan still watch this movie.. 
 For any real fan of Martin Gardner, this book is a must. In it he explains why he cannot agree with relativism, pragmatism, determinism, atheism, Marxism, and several other modern isms. His views are somewhat surprising. For example, although he is famous for being a skeptic of paranormal phenomena, Gardner is open to the idea of immortality. Even stranger, he defends believing in God on faith.   Gardner realizes that this is not what most of his readers expected. In fact, he even went so far as to publish, under a pseudonym, a critical review of this work in the New York Review of Books, in which he describes himself as "a simpleminded fideist" and the book as "bizarre". (This hilarious review is reprinted in Gardner's The Night Is Large).   Although I'm a big fan of this book, I have to partially agree with Gardner's pseudonym. There's a lot in it that I disagree with, which is why I give it "only" a four star rating. But it is as good a read as you could hope for. 
 I remember back when this band was still somewhat underground. I watched the video for "My Last Serenade" and got addicted to this band. I got even more addicted when listening to the staccato melodies in "Life To Lifeless". This CD is a landmark in the overcrowded metalcore subgenre today.   This is one of those CD's that actually stands out in a genre of music. It sounds 100% fresh, nothing rehashed, and pleasant to many ears. Also, it has remakes of two tracks off their debut self-titled, "Vide Infra" and "Temple From The Within". It's pretty cool if you ask me.  Favorite songs: "My Last Serenade" "Life To Lifeless" "Temple From The Within" "Fixation on the Darkness" "Numbered Days 
 This is good book and is well researched.  It gives balanced exposition to both the optimists and pessimists in their takes on oil depletion and the peak oil phenomenon.  I already believe that the pessimists are right - our civilization is in for a very rough ride that will begin in the very near future.  So, I think the balance Roberts provides does not give the impending crisis the gravity it deserves.  The author is being a good journalist by presenting the alternative energy possibilities as potential ways to soften the blow of an oil crunch, but I think alarm bells should be going off.  Kunstler's The Long Emergency does a better job of scaring the hell out of you - and rightly so 
 This is one of the best book on Velazquez. Velazquez a prototypical "painter's painter", was a master at "achieving more with less". This large format book depicts virtually every work that is currently attributed to the artist. So, for practical purposes, it serves as a Velazquez catalogue raisonne. Large, very clear color and B&W photos allow you to get a very good feel for the way Velazquez constucted his paintings. Emile Carolus-Duran (Sargent's teacher) urged his students "study Velazquez without respite". This is an exceptional book from which to study 
 This is a fantastic novel... it is so well written. You are transported to a village during the bubonic plague.   The descriptions are fantastic, the drama, the pain, the fear, tenderness, caring, worries, and above it all, the confusion of the bubonic plague in England.   Some parts are a bit crude and the end is too abrupt and simplistic for the depth and richness of the novel. A 5 star rating without the last 15 pages.  Great reading it along with Galileo's daughter -about the same time, but in Italy. 
 john kay is one of the great classic rock songwriters and performers.this album was one of steppenwolf's best 
 You're not going to be able to find another DVD that has all these legendary performers going up one by one to the same stage to perform for the same audience. So if you enjoy "old-timey mountain music", i.e. bluegrass, then just buy this DVD, and prepare to watch and listen again and again.  I have quite a few music DVDs, and I think the quality of this one is superior:  1) It's recorded in 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround sound.  2) Another reviewer complained about grainy video, but they just need to get a higher quality TV: I have a flat-screen Sony WEGA TV, and the picture is crisp and sharp.  3) Several reviewers have complained about the placement of the backstage conversations, and even the pre-concert footage. Suffice to say that since we weren't the directors, then it's not our decision. All concert DVDs have this extra footage; it's what people expect. I have music/concert DVDs where between every song are long rambling philosophical sermons by band members. It's like, hello! Put that stuff at the end instead of forcing it on people. That's not the case with this DVD. They do cut away near the end of a song by The Cox Family, but they're "keepin' it real", and you have to expect some of that on a concert DVD. Just be glad they didn't slip in some studio-shot music videos! (Like some other music DVDs that shall remain nameless.)  4) I would buy this just for the Cox Family performing "(Will There Be Any) Stars In My Crown," which is a pure bonus, since it was not in the "O Brother Where Art Thou?" movie soundtrack (which I have). In fact this is my favorite song performance of the whole DVD.  5) Some reviewers have complained about the lack of a "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow" performance. My suggestion to those who pine for that song is to simply buy the "O Brother Where Art Thou?" movie soundtrack, and you will be the proud owner of no less than four different renditions on four different tracks, by four different blends of musicians. Bon appetite!  6) Lastly, I commend the directors, because in my opinion the screen shots and camera angles were just right. I don't want to have the camera shots jiggling and jumping around like a drunk monkey has ahold of the camera, and I don't want to just see one straight-on view, either. The directors find the right balance in this DVD, with a nice variety of close-ups of the singers and wider-angle stage shots.  Just buy this DVD and enjoy 
 Hillarious movie! They play great double roles as the arab brothers and themselves. There is also a very funny seen involving piotai.(Hope I spelled that right) My advice is to buy or rent this movie. Other suggested C&C films:Up In Smoke, Next Movie, Nice Dreams, Far Out Man, Born In East L.A., Still Smokin 
 For me it would have been more difficult to appreciate this book had I not read "Out of the Shadows." I had purchased these books over ten years ago but only read them within the past few months. One of the great values of Carnes approach is his no wholes barred, stratight on approach to addiction and the role that sexual addiction plays. There is nothing wishy-washy in his approach to the dilemma, nor is there anything apologetic about his criticisms (i.e. limitations) of AA and common theraputic practices. To me he is entirely convincing which speaks for his clear understanding of addiction that adds for the breakdown of social or societal illusions and delusions. I just wish he took more seriously what he refers to as stage one addictions to which he does concede some degree of (to me mostly unjustifiable) normalcy and acceptance based on social norms. Aside from that, it is simply an outstanding book 
 If I had to choose only ten books that I could read (over and over, hopefully) for the rest of my life this would probably be at the top of that list.  I know that I should list the Holy Bible first, but I am certain that I would read this far more often 
 This is now one of my favorite books.  I loved it.  After visiting Gettysburg someone suggested I read it and it brought the whole battle, and the people fighting it, alive for me.  Being a a Yankee, I was surprised how much I cared for the Rebels.  It truly made the history alive and compelling.  A great book for history buffs and also anyone who loves a good book.  You do not have to be a civil war or history buff to love it. 
 The Clash's best songs or most popular, the best were the true punk ones like Clash City Rockers and Whats My Name and all the stuff from the first 2 albums, anyway its got great footage and great songs and i love it 
 Thucydides (c.460-c.400 BC) was an insider during the Peloponesian War.  He was an Athenian commander who was dismissed after his men lost a battle in spite of the fact of his previous successes.  This book was an attempt at an honest historical assessment of the Peloponesian War which was not only destructive to the Athenians and  eventually the Spartans, but the war was also ruinous to their allies.  The important theme of this book is that Athenian hubris replaced practicle thinking leading to Athenian imperialism and war.  Thucydides investigated this war by examining battle sites, interviewing both Athenian and Spartan commanders, and inspecting the limited sources that existed for historians at that time.  He was clear that the primary cause of the Peloponesian War was fear of Athenian imperialism especially among the Spartans and their allies.  One should note that the Athenians not only made enemies of the Peloponeisan League (The Spartans and their allies), but the Athenians made enemies of those Greeks who were neutral but were driven by necessity to join the Peloponesian League.    An important part of theis book which is found in the Penguin Classics edition can be found on pages 242-244.  Thucydides made some poignant remarks regarding how thought and language are corrupted during times of revolution and war.  He comments that manners and civility collapsed during the Peloponesian War.  He also warned readers that during such crises that thoughtful, intelligent men are destroyed because too many people are willing to commit violence on behalf of demogogues rather than engage in calm reflection.  This is in line with the chapter on Von Hayek's THE ROAD TO SERFDOM titled "Why the Worst get on top."  If one follows Thucydides THE HISTORY OF THE PELOPONESIAN WAR carefully, they will discover that the Athenians had considerable power and wealth.  Yet, Athenian arrogance and greed resulted in a useless war that resulted in the loss of Athenian power and wealth.  This book is a microcosm of the adage that, "The bigger an empire is, the weaker it is."  This book is useful in examination of the catostophic wars and revolutions of the 20th century.  George Orwell made comment on the corruption of language in his essays and novels, expecially 1984.  Crane Briton cites Thucydides' book in Briton's book title ANATOMY OF REVOLUTION.  In other words, while this book was written c. 410 B.C., this book is still timely which makes it a classic 
 This is the type of novel most writers can naught but aspire to craft!  I was first introduced to this novel in my sophomore year in high school. (Far from what the misguided reviewer below posted, I did not protest, but devoured every bit of this breathtaking work of art!)  I was instantly captured by the unique writing style as well as the remarkable story, and, needless to say, this book remains one of my favorite - if not my very favorite - novels I was assigned to read in high school.  The novel is written in three different narratives, told primarily in a documentary fashion, giving it the feel of an epic.  The story follows three generations of women in the Trueba family, whose patriarch is the selfish, dictatorial, but ultimately understandable Esteban Trueba.  By naming the female characters of the story specifically to symbolize purity ("Blanca" means "white" in Spanish, while "Clara," "Nivea," and "Alba" embody clarity, snow, and dawn respectively), Allende deliberately explores feminism, setting her story in a society which thrives on conservative, chauvinistic ideals.   Which brings me to the violence.  Yes, there are rape scenes; let me explain:  Allende, at this point in the story, is trying to convey the absolute horror of Esteban Trueba's relations with peasant girls (a metaphor for the mistreatment of the working class by the upper class, and also the mistreatment of women by men, expanding on Allende's notions of feminism).  The scenes are explicit because they are meant to be shocking and infuriating to a great degree.  Far from making this novel "abhorrent," these scenes add emotional impact to the story.  Who will like this book: -Readers who appreciate a well-worded, well-crafted classic -Feminists -Readers who don't mind being shocked or disturbed by certain scenes that are meant to be shocking and disturbing -Readers who can empathize with profound, colorful, developed characters -Readers who love broad, eventful plotlines and hidden meanings, metaphors, and symbolism -Readers who don't mind a bit of magic realism! -Readers who can appreciate a story which plays out like music  Who will not like this book: -Readers who cannot stand feminism or are open chauvinists -Readers who cannot tolerate shocking or explicit scenes -Readers who are easily offended by the glorification of radical or liberal ideas (for the record, homosexuality is not glorified but stated as a simple, existing part of the world, much like the existence of concepts such as feminism, prejudice, and true love)  With exception to the above mentioned audience, I can guarantee that this book will keep its reader turning pages!  A masterpiece 
 I love the game and love the music!  glad to know that such a thing is respected!  this how alice should be 
      This book gives a well rounded look at the work of Edward Sheriff  Curtis in a size that is easy to handle 
 there are a lot of canon lovers who like to post negative reviews on other camera brands.  well, this camera has a unique feature that other brands don't have--in-camera stitching of up to three wide angle shots so that you get a great superwide panoramic shot right out of the camera.  no computer is needed.  and yes, you can save the shots individually if you want to stitch them on a computer.  just save three individual 23 mm shots--it is not rocket science.  comments that the camera lacks RAW are silly--this is not a big, bulky dSLR or a really sophisticated camera with lots of manual controls--sorry, but that is not the target for this camera--it is a pocket camera that takes easy, wide angle shots and panoramics.  RAW is for people who want to fine tune pictures on their computers.   so, in sum, this is a great camera for shooting scenery and when indoors, getting all the folks in the picture without having to back up far away.  i highly recommend it!  (and Kodak's colors are wonderful! 
 Middle age doesn't suit Harry Angstrom.  Just when the erstwhile high school basketball star settles into a comfortable blue-collar life, things come unglued.  His wife leaves him, drifters move in, and everything goes up in flames in a hurry.  Harry takes his setbacks in stride, frustratingly so, and he seems to have little passion for anything.  Except, perhaps, for defending America's role in the Vietnam War.  "Rabbit Redux" is an unsettling book to read.  You want to grab the Rabbit by the collar and shake some sense into him.  What happened to that wide-eyed youngster who could do no wrong?  That's probably the message of this well written book.  Youthful potential often doesn't blossom into later-day success.  And the dream of mid-life Americana sometimes isn't all that it's cracked up to be 
 An excellent read.  If you enjoy the movie, then pick up the book 
 I am in love with Tilly and the Wall.  After hearing their first album "Wild Like Children" for the first time around a year ago, I was instantly hooked by the group's unique style and carefree sound. It's not too often that a band decides to forego the typical drumset for a drum machine, but when a band passes up both of those items for a tap dancer and trash can lids...well, it's time to have some fun! That being said, "Bottoms of Barrels" is a lot of the same, and so much more.  Mike Mogis steps in this timme around as producer, and it shows. The man famous for working with bands like Bright Eyes and The Concretes has made Tilly and the Wall sound much more well-rounded and polished. No longer does Tilly and the Wall sound like a one-trick high school gimmick band. They sound legitimate now, yet they maintain their signature sound.  The album begins with "Rainbows in the Dark," the standard Tilly and the Wall song that doesn't stray much from "Fell Down the Stairs, "the lead-off track to their previous album. What is noticably different, however, is the lyrical content. Whereas "Wild Like Children" was essentially an album about kissing, dancing, and other fun "Child-ish" things, "Bottoms of Barrels" contains more adult lyrics and even more of an adult sound. "Love Song," for example, is perhaps Tilly and the Wall's first attempt at a true acoustic guitar ballad. It is not only more mature than any Tilly and the Wall song before it, but it is also beautiful, well-written, and utterly unique. This matured Tilly and the Wall is all over the place on the album, notably on "Lost Girls" and "Coughing Colors." Despite this, the band has managed to maintain what made them so attractive in the past.  "Bottoms of Barrels" is a really fun album. The first single "Bad Education," for example, perfectly displays how the band has matured musically, yet remained true to their fans and their sound. Additionally, songs like "Sing Songs Along," "Black and Blue," and "The Freest Man" will be stuck in your head for days (and perhaps longer, but I've only had the CD for a week). Don't be mistaken. Tilly and the Wall is back, and they are louder, happier, and more fun-loving than ever before. This album completely wallops their previous efforts, and I am still obsessed with them.  By all means, "Bottoms of Barrels" is an amazing album. Tilly and the Wall is one of the most underappreciated and unnoticed bands in music today. Hopefully, this album will help get them the admiration and attention that they undoubtedly deserve. Indeed, with such attractive melodies and beautiful lyrics, there's nothing on this album that should go unloved. "Bottoms of Barrels" is one of the best albums of 2006 thus far, and from the sound of it, Tilly and the Wall has much much more in store for us!!  Recommended for fans of Tilly and the Wall, Mates of State, The Boy Least Likely To and anyone who needs music to accompany their carefree activities, like playing in the sprinkler.  Key Tracks: 1. "Rainbows in the Dark" 2. "Bad Education" 3. "Love Song: 4. "Sing Songs Along" 5. "Black and Blue"  5 out of 5 Star 
 This is Book Two in a three book series.  The second book in a trilogy is rarely the best, and this one isn't either.  It gets a little stuck in motion in the middle, but I didn't mind because I so enjoyed being lost in this fascinating world of Seyonne.  The writing is fabulous.  I gave books one and three five stars.  I highly recommend the series, beginning with "Transformation. 
 With "Can You Forgive Her?" Trollope begins his masterful series of Parliamentary novels, but here he is concerned with the politics of love and the demands of society. Alice Vavasor, lovely, intelligent and just a bit prudish, is torn between two men -- the upright if plodding John Gray, and the evasive yet alluring George Vavasor.  She has accepted and rejected their proposals of marriage, uncertain of her own worthiness and the worth of her love. Alice's dilemma makes for a sharp exploration of free choice, a woman's role in a constricted society, and self-examination to the point of emotional stalemate.  Add to this the predicament, on a grander scale, of Lady Glencora Palliser, Alice's cousin.  The energetic, vivacious and utterly charming Glencora is married to Plantagent Palliser, heir to a ducal throne, who is a man who finds passion in Parliamentary proceedings, not people.  Glencora is still pining for the beautiful ne'er-do-well, Burgo Fitzgerald, whom she was forced to leave behind in order to marry as she had been groomed to.  Glencora feels that her young marriage is a sham. She feels she cannot live a life without ardent love, that the future for her is bleak without a burning, almost tragic, passion.  Here, Trollope examines a marriage in its first tentative stages (in the Palliser novels he gives us the most discerning and moving portrait of a marriage in literature), with all of the self-sacrifice, compromise and reluctant devotion that marriage entails.  The novel's third subplot, involving Alice's aunt's choice between somewhat unsuitable suitors, provides a comic, yet still subtly touching, foil to the two main stories. Throughout, Trollope brilliantly evokes the power of society on its players, their private tumult, their public displays of decorum or disgrace.  One scene in particular, at a fabulous ball, is among the most thrilling in literature, because Trollope manages to convey, amid the throngs of idle partygoers, the despair, the conflicted psychological motivations, the terror and anguish of two star-crossed lovers, Glencora and Burgo, whose passions are so different: hers a naive yet heartfelt romance, his a self-centered quest for an end to financial woe whatever the emotional cost and public scandal. Neither party is self-aware enough to change here, but one eventually learns to, and finds hope by overcoming the hestitation of commitment brought on by misdirected ardor. The only way to grow is through sacrifice, and fearless self-knowledge. The only way truly to live is through doing the next right thing, publicly and privately. Trollope takes us through the agonizing conflicts of his characters, drawn with a depth and nuance matched by few in literature. This is a towering achievement 
 Not the best of tracks but my son did love playing with it.  Not many cars (other than the one that came with it) can actually make it all the way around the track.  Only one track layout option.  But this was still the best track i've seen from hot wheels in a long time 
 My kids are really crazy about these 3 films,but they think that this one is really the best one 
 I have been waiting for this book for a long time.  Seriously, there is a hole in western consciousness and in our publications about REALITY---the fact that western culture is ruining the planet, and how do we as individuals make a new way?  With more calculaton tables than I liked, but interspersed with interesting, inspiring, thought-provoking world experience, philosophical musings and present-day challenges in carving a sustainable lifestyle, Merkel's book arrests the imagination of the reader.  I think about this subject every day and I have Merkel to thank for pointing me toward concrete ways to `live as if life truly matters.'  If you're looking for related hardcore simplicity (which isn't really so simple in this culture, is it?) check out www.myfootprint.org (more of Merkel's work) and Primal Conscious Living on the web---a couple in Georgia making sustainability real in their daily lives:  http://geocities.com/newlibertyvillage/earthstar.ht 
 I love this album. I can't stop listening. She is really talented and has such a pure voice. I'm waiting for more from her cause I know she'll be around for a while with that talen 
 This is one of the latest entries in the Millennium Collection series and as such, should be considered as a very basic introduction to the artist/group featured.  With this release, however, even the most ardent fans (such as myself) will want to own this one!  Yes, it is little more than a "greatest hits" collection, but there are some great surprises: a rare stereo mix of the fantastic pot-boiling "I'll Keep Holding On," an alternate mix of "The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game," (with an added verse available previously only on the Anthology vinyl LP) and a slighty different mix of "When You're Young And In Love."   The capper is a fantastic (and I do mean FANTASTIC) photo of the group featured on the back of the CD case. It's worth it to own this new release if only for this photo of these beautiful women.  GRRRRRR!     Thanks to these collections, many new fans will be added to the legions of already-present admirers 
 Have you ever had a challenging conversation with a spouse, co-worker, friend, or family member that didn't turn out so well?  Did you ever wonder how to best deal with a significant person in your life without causing stress when needing to approach a topic? The authors give great advise to handle most conversations that might otherwise cause stress.  I love this book. I loved it the first time I read it, the second time, the third, and more.  It's a must for anyone interested in getting more from their relationships.  An absolute must read!! 
 I remember reading this in the 4th grade.  It introduced me to the world of poetry in a "lauguage" that I could understand.  I had to buy it for my own children.  The arrival time was excellent from the time that I placed the order 
 Wow! I'm not sure how they did it, but they managed to pack in two 5-star villians who don't have anything to do with each other into the mix. And two heros, Bruce Willis' character and the little boy.  Action, check. Music score, check. Sound effects, check. Make up and blood, check. Fire, oh yeah, plenty of it. Gunshots galore. Acting, ya it's there. Just look at Bruce Willis' face, it says it all.  I won't spoil any of the story, but if you're into movies with hostage situations, this one's for you. From a psychotic troubled youth killer to a cold, calculating mastermind, there's enough to keep you watching. One of Bruce Willis' finest, guaranteed 
 This novel is not just the story of the idealist probation officer Steven Baum versus the sociopath crack addict and drug dealer Darryl King but a story of a city (New York) where the melting pot society is divided by races, greed, social classes, poverty, corruption and absence of moral values.  Most than a "slow motion riot", the author picture a city sat on a time bomb where the criminality, violence and corruption are keep at bay or ignored with some "legal" methods without any intention of erradicate it, where minorities lost hope in the system and are induced to criminal activities and delinquency because of unemployment, low education rates, poverty, low salaries, dependency of social aid and segregation.  A very explicit message for those who still dream with a more equalitarian society and for those who already lost hope in society and are paying the consequences of that cruel reality 
 Julius Fast's "Body Language" provides an excellent and reader-friendly overview of body language without going into too much detail. One of the basic "Must Reads" on this topic 
 This was by far the scariest book I have EVER read.  I had to put it down quite a few times because I was sure that there were vampires behind me.  Good character development (which is important to me)and full of surprises.  If you get scared easily, this might not be the book for you 
 not saying Vinn Deisel knows how to be anything else, but I do think he plays this role well. I genuinely enjoyed this movie 
 Tom Waits's experimental edge, which began largely with SWORDFISHTROMBONES, finds its pinacle in BONE MACHINE.  This is an album that would later be largely replicated with REAL GONE (a record that is so loud and busy, it takes several listens to get to the point), but is much more direct than the future album: MACHINE is about decay, both physical and psyhological, and how the erosion of time affects us all.  The gutteral "Earth Died Screaming" opens the album, while the beautiful "That Feel" (co-written with and featuring Keith Richards) closes out the set.  In between, the songs range from busy, bustling stoms ("All Stripped Down"), sentimental ballads ("A Little Rain"), recitations ("The Ocean Doesn't Want Me"), even off-beat gospel ("Jesus Gonna Be Here").  The overall effect is an album that comes off as brilliant--which is simply because it IS brilliant.  Tom Waits is a musical genius; his experimental edge, combined with a knack for poetic lyrics and a hooky melody (also melodies that seem to make no sense at all) pushes him far above his peers.  Actually, it's safe to say that Waits has no peers--he is in a class all his own, making music like only he could.  If you've never heard anything like Tom Waits, it's ok--because there ISN'T anything else like him 
 This is an incredibly honest and inspiring story.  I laughed and I cried along with Ms. Gilbert.  She says things I have thought but never thought could be said out loud.  I am recommending this book to everyone I know 
 If "The Space Book" was on Blue Note, it would be a bestseller.   Booker Ervin of course did end up with a Blue Note contract in the late  1960s, but his best work was behind him at that point.  That "best  work" is the half-dozen or so albums he made for Prestige in the  mid-60s, and particularly "The Freedom Book" and "The Space  Book."  Ervin's band of Jaki Byard, Richard Davis and Alan Dawson  communicates almost telepathically, and it shows especially on the songs  "Number Two" and "Mojo."  There were some incredible  albums made in 1964 -- "A Love Supreme," "Speak No  Evil," "Point of Departure," "Song for my Father,"  etc.  "The Space Book" should be included in that prestigious  company 
 This book attracted a lot of attention from the Federal Trade  Commission, who regulates mergers in the U.S. In fact, they organized a Research Roundtable around the book in December 2002 (see http://www.ftc.gov/be/rt/mergerroundtable.htm for the transcripts). Although the math is strenuous, there is plenty of explanatory material here to make this interesting to students and practitioners of mergers 
 This book was indepth research of King of kings Cyrus the Great with respect how did He became the King of Persia/Iran.  Interestingly, Cyrus the Great became the King of Iran not by having large army but by hard work, and relying on His good allies and friends to establish His empire.  If English is your second language or if you are first time reader of Cyrus the Great you may wish to read this book "Xenophon's Cyrus The Great" by Larry HEDRICK in order to grasp King of kings Cyrus the Great very well.  Ahura Mazda be with you 
 The latest installment in the DuPree mysteries was a little more convoluted than I expected.  Even when I finished, I had to go back and reread parts of the story to figure out just why/what happened.  Bowen never spells it out, he leaves you to work it out for yourself, much like Benetsee does to DuPree. As far as the mystery goes, it's not my favorite in the series, Ash Child and Notches worked better in that department.  But for pure enjoyment,the storytelling was superb, the humor wry, and the people so real you feel you could eat at the roadhouse next friday. As to the other reviewer who disliked the book, I think this story would be more enjoyable to people who are already somewhat familliar with the series than to a first timer.  The relationships of the characters are more important to the story than the mystery.  If you can start with the first book and work your way through, you'll get far more out of it.   I did like the cast of players in the front.  Finally we have a count of and names for Madaline's 4 (+-) children (Although I have to wonder what happened to Stephanie, her oldest from Coyote Wind, Simon and little Sebastian, and the two or three other children named earlier in the series...maybe I'll just chalk it up to DuPree or possibly Bowen having one too many ditches...) But as for The Tumbler, fans of the series will definitly enjoy this latest installment. I look forward to the next book 
 In 1970, Christopher Lee was the reigning Dracula, but having already performed the role in three or four Hammer films, he was dissatisfied by the hissing, caricatured--though effective--version that had been created for him. He longed to interpret the role in a manner closer to Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. The opportunity arose in the film under discussion. Made with a small budget in Spain, an international cast, a director--Jess Franco--as deplored in some circles as he was revered, "El Conde Dracula" was, in fact, the closest adaptation of the novel that had been attempted to that date. Originally intended for Spanish television, the project became too formidable for the small screen, and became a theatrical production. However, it was filmed with the 4:3 TV screen in mind, and is intended to be seen in that 1.33:1 aspect ratio: Dark Sky presents it exactly that way--an honorable move to fulfill the film maker's wishes in these days of 16x9 TVs and frame-cropping vandalism. Lee is superb, looking and sounding exactly like he had leapt off the pages of Stoker's novel, almost all his dialogue actually lifted directly from it. The interpretation puts other so-called "authentic" Draculas to shame, like Coppola's ridiculous travesty performed for him by Gary Oldman. Only Louis Jourdan in the 1978 BBC adaptation--altogether the closest dramatization of the novel, is as impressive, in a different way, as Christopher Lee is here.   The opening scenes of the film are brilliant, with much subtle and striking imagery. As the film proceeds, budgetary constraints seem to have necessitated that the film and novel part company, with many omissions. Nevertheless there is much to recommend.  The new Dark Sky DVD is unquestionably the best the film has ever looked. It is sourced from an archival Italian print with a French opening title showing that it was intended for export: "Les Nuits de Dracula." The English soundtrack has been synched to the visual element. It is strikingly different from earlier versions in its clarity and color, as well as blue tinting in scenes where it was intended but never appeared in home video sources. One 54-second scene is not part of the Italian edit: a mother hammers on the door of Castle Dracula pleading for the return of her baby. While it is affecting, it is not really integral, and compared with the novel, it occurs a month too early. The scene had been filmed, I am informed, once before: in the 1953 Turkish "Drakula Istanbulda" which I have not seen. If one knows the scene from those murky early VHS tapes, it might be missed. It is unclear what Franco's intention was: he tended to hurry from one project to another, and there are always several international edits of his films. He has, in fact contradicted himself in conversation about his preferences, and has never addressed this particular scene at all.  The DVD contains an interview with Jess Franco as well as Christopher Lee reading a heavily cut and adapted version of the story originally heard on an old LP set. All in all, this is a DVD worth having 
 This is an outstanding guide for the dissertation process. I have consulted several other similar works on how to write a dissertation but this is the one I have relied on the most because it is comprehensive and very easy to follow.  The entire text can be read in a few hours for a very good over view of the process.  Then it becomes a very handy "survival" life line when problems come up. 
 It was very easy to put together and takes up minimum space.  However, the sound is not minimal and is great for my needs.  I particularly like the equalizer for both my pop and classical music.  The radio, with the antenna, has great sound with little static.  The cd player is great for my needs; easy to play just one cd or the entire deck.  My only quibble is that it has a single cassette deck and is not auto reversible.  But that's a small price for having a system with great sound.    Instruction book, as most books are, could use a little ironing out but I was able to get started and if you have set up a shelf system before, this should be a breeze.  If you haven't set one up before, you should have no trouble 
 Wow! I've been waiting 20 years for this release and I'm happy with it. I was surprised to see all the bad reviews over the sound, mine sounds great and it sounds even better than the original album. "Spell" is a great lost track, I am glad it is included here. 
 Here is your golden opportunity, while it lasts, to pick up a fantastic CD. Sydney and Wild Bill are in grand form. In fact, the entire band sounds superb. My favorite tracks on this high fidelity recording (1949 and 1950, yet the sound is clear with a high and consistent recording level) are Tailgate Ramble, Running Wild, and You Can't Have None of my Jelly Roll.  If you are a fan of early jazz, you will really enjoy this. I have never cared a lick for soprano sax in easy listening venues. But, when Sydney Bechet blows it, my feet start to dance. You will not go wrong by owning this wonderful CD.  Now, I'll stop yacking so you can get cracking 
 I love the Piggle-Wiggle books! I was first introduced to the seres when my third grade teacher read them to the class. I have enjoyed reading them to my own students since then...Children love hearing about the different tales and adventures of the children who are friends of Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle! The stories come alive for all people who hear these stories because it's so easy to relate to. I think we all can remember a time when we had trouble interrupting or not cleaning up after ourselves!!!! These stories are a true treasure! 
 This is the best water filter I have found also have a Pur but like my Brita bette 
 If you're looking for a good laugh, you've come to the right book. Poisonous Quotes have many critisisms for almost everything in this world. Not to mention when it comes from famous authors, presidents, or thinkers.   Whether you're sharing this with someone or using a classic retort, this book is perfect for your needs of insults and hilarious laughs 
 Ken Tucker is like one of those great old sportswriters--Grantland Rice or Red Smith--in that he can turn something as sweaty and pedestrian as prime time TV into sheer poetry. His opinions on what is good and bad about television are idiosyncratic, unpredictable (Love "Silk Stalkings"? Hate "Mystery Science Theater"?) and intriguing. But always, always beautifully argued. He's America's best and smartest critic. We're fortunate that he's devoted so much thought and attention to something as accessible as TV.   
 My ELL students go wild over these books, and the back-to-front reading format doesn't seem to affect their usual English reading lessons. I introduced this set into my classroom library this past year. I imagine having seen the film first was helpful for most of my students, but any enticement to read has to be worth something. It certainly is from my standpoint as a teacher. These books are beautiful to look at and obviously fun to read. They remind me of the old Tintin adventure books which helped teach many overseas students to read English a generation ago 
 I think it is important to understand who writes these reviews and where they are coming from.  I am a Team Leader for a 70 member real estate firm.  Therefore anything that can help me better manage 70 independent contractors is well worth the read.  I found this book to be exceptional because (1) it kept my interest peaked, (2) it contains a lot of great quotes and theories, (3) it reinforced what I am doing right and (4) more importantly, provided me with food-for-thought about how I can do a lot more things better.  I intend to use Ben Franklins method of concentrating on just one "trait" per week and then grade myself on how well I advanced the concept during the week until I work my way through all 12 Rules.  Should be an interesting couple of months.  I highly recommend this book to anyone in management or who is interested in business 
 It has been a while since I have heard a group with as much balanced musical talent that is fearfully displayed here. A well rounded set of death inducing riffs that leaves the listener with a sense of anger and physical adrenaline. The vocalist produces an unimaginable rollercoaster of emotions through sounds that seem foreign from a humans limits. Backed by the previously described musical ferociousness this album is a definite necessity to ones music collection. Get it 
 The book cover premise of four suicidal Londoners meeting on a rooftop sounds like a bad bit of skit TV.  But, Nick Hornby fleshes this out into an engaging story.  I was particularly taken with the unpredictable, yet plausible paths that each character follows separately and together.  The writing is funny and thoughtful.  Mr. Hornby has moved onto the short list of authors that warrant a book purchase as soon as their next work is published.  Kasey Cotull 
 A friend had recommended "Hairball" to me, and it was one of those books that I absolutely devoured. MacKenzie's delicate tightrope of allowing just enough of the corporate bureaucracy to balance your freedom-loving creativity to keep you in orbit (hence the metaphor) is good reading for both bureaucrats and creatives. MacKenzie understands that both sides need each other to truly accomplish something in business or in life 
   "Wuthering Heights" is a cruel,complex, unforgettable look at possessive love. The 1847 novel was the only one witten by Emily Bronte. The story tells of Heathcliff who is an orphan adopted on a Liverpool journey by Mr. Earnshaw. He brings the ragged lad back home to the wild moors of Yorkshire. Heathcliff is mistreated by the oafish Hindley Earnshaw the son of the family. He spends long dreamy hours wandering the moors with Catherine the Earnshaw daughter. After many complications Heathcliff leaves England for mysterious regions. He returns years later to discover Catherine has married the weak milquetoast Edgar Linton who gives Catherine the security and kind love of a well to do landowner.     Catherine dies giving birth to daughter Cathy. Heathcliff weds the infatuated sister Isabella sister of Edgar Linton. In the second half of the novel Catherine's daughter will wed the son of Heathcliff and Isabella.  Isabella has fled from the cruel Heathcliff dying at an early age.   The novel is structured as a flashback to events told by Nelly Dean a nurse to Catherine who relates them to Mr. Lockwood a shallow English dandy who has rented Thrushcross Grange following a failed romantic affair.    The novel switches from past to present dealing with many characters with similar names. Heathcliff is often called satanic and is a figure of Dantian and Satanic power. He is very cruel killing small animals; driving Isabella away and insulting everyone. He mistreats his son and his alcoholic nephew. Heathcliff is as rough as a crag of rock on the wild moors. He longs for a complete soul union with Catherine. He even has her dug up from the grave so he can look at her dead face! Necrophilia, sadism, overt cruelty to the weak are everday occurrences at Wuthering Heights which is ruled by the tyrant Heathcliff and his mean toady servant the repulsive Bible thumping Joseph.   Catherine is petulant, violent, selfish and  cruel. Neither Heathcliff or Catherine are admirable characters. They apparently love and long for one another. At one point Catherine tells Nelly "Heathcliff and I are one soul." Following her death she will haunt Heathcliff as she roams the stark moors in neither heaven or hell.    Libraries have been built dealing with the complexity of this novel. It demands several rereads. Let it be said that the novel is always fresh, suprising and modern. Wuthering Heights is not your typical love story. It is harsh, stark and cruel. Read it and ponder this tale of ghostly, obsessive, dreamliike love set against the dark brooding moors of Yorkshire. The characters will leave a permanent imprint on your mind and heart 
 First off - to the reviewer dated October 12, 2000 - sure you completed The Crucible in '97 and supervised it in '99 - A Marine wannabe, for sure. This is an EXCELLENT book that outlines The Crucible, the culmination of Marine Corps boot camp. Provides a detailed history of events that gives rational to the specific events or stations of the design of the Crucible. Also allows us to appreciate more the recruits who have earned the title "Marine." A must read for anyone who has a loved one in boot camp, earned the title of Marine, or future recruits. Easy reading, factual and very informative. Gives confirmation to the quote above the Welcome Doors of Parris Island: "Through These Portals Pass Prospect's For America's Finest Fighting Force - United States Marines." In light of the conflict going on in Iraq, people who review and make ridiculous comments (those who probably never even read the book!) should be thankful that men and women of the USMC and other prestigious branches of the military are laying their lives down everyday, so that they can sit in the comfort of their home and express their opinions freely, and without consequence. This is a great book for those interested in this particular phase of boot camp and with a brief overview, the (in an indroductive sense) history of the USMC. I highly recommend this!    
 This book is a great overview of construction - it covers building stages ranging from the foundation to framing to roof details to types of siding  available.  Some electrical basics discussed, tips and tricks to keep in  mind -- overall a good, lucid, well-thought out book that can get you  started with construction 
 We received this book as a gift and my daughter took to it immediately, which is saying a lot, because she does not get that "into" books.  I think she especially likes this one because when I read it to her I can sing the story to "I'm a Little Teapot".  I don't think I would have bought this one had I seen it in a store, but I sure and glad we have it 
 This is an exciting and explorative story that merges informed quantum physics with imaginative story teller 
 An incredible read; an incredible story, make that stories. I couldn't wait to get home every night to continue the never ending saga of these men of heroic proportions. The depth of information by the author woven into an  amazing technicolor fabric of a story that really needs to be told and told  well is in this book. I became immersed in the lives of these characters  and characters they were; I could almost feel what they felt as they lived  their lives among that untamed wilderness we simply call the west, however,  the lives of these amazing men was anything but simple 
 This is my first Sandra Hill. I am pleasantly surprised. the humor was good and realistic. sure a little far-fetched but very enjoyable. I am calling borders now to order the rest 
 I love this book, and so do all the children I know who have had it read to them. The point of the story is that trolls are incredibly stupid. Anybody looking for a deeper meaning will be disappointed. Some of the reviewers asked if it's a retelling of a real Norwegian folktale. Indeed it is. The original title is "The Cat on the Dovrefell" in Asbjornsen and Moe's "Norwegian Folktales" (1841) 
 Chris Keane's book is absolutely powerful for the screenwriting novice, such as me.  His instructional approach is easy to understand and encouraging.  He explains how to begin -- how to keep motivated -- and how to pursue.  His simple exercises show how to develop your story, character and structure -- then, he lets you know what to do next.  Mr. Keane is a gifted writer and an excellent instructor.  I highly recommend this publication for anyone wishing to achieve a screenwriting career 
 This cd hits hard. must ha 
 I am as close to a Homer purist as you will find:  BA and MA in classics.  Of course this book is no substitute for Homer's original:  that narrative defined all western standards for storytelling. But I must give Baricco the highest marks for crystalizing and presenting (quite powerfully) the elements of the Iliad that are still relevant to human circumstances.  We no longer believe that a pantheon of gods intimately involve themselves in the lives of a few heroic figures.  It is therefore the job of the modern interpreter to find the purely human motivations that haven't changed over the millennia.  This Baricco has done superbly.  The characters do not all sound alike, as the other reviewer claims: that's just wrong.  As one who has studied Homer line by line in the original, I have as much reason in theory to be bored or unimpressed by this project.  But I am not. It made me think about the original in a new way, and that's no small feat 
 Typically, I have not genuinely enjoyed Mr. Roeder's work; and yet, since I enjoy reading the whole teen angst-coming out-feeling different thing (okay, fine, haven't gotten over my own tortured adolescence yet, I'll admit it), I always seem to find the descriptions interesting.  Then when the books arrive I usually can't get past the first chapter and think one of the following:  1 - Too trite for words OR 2 - Clearly written for a younger audience and therefore, I don't get it OR 3 - Would writing characterization that doesn't prescribe to stereotypes kill this guy?  All that said, I have read (okay, well, I have read the first couple chapters anyway) many of Mr. Roeder's books and this time around, he gets four stars from me.  No wooden characters, an interesting plot that seriously didn't *have* to have gay characters at it's core, characterizations that invoked real people to me...finally, a Roeder book I enjoyed.  Yes, the intended audience is younger than me.  But this was an all around good story, well written and thoroughly entertaining.  Oh, one more thing:  it was not the least bit predictable.  Well done, Sir 
 'The Wall Street Journal' it seems to me has the most sane and persuasive political writing of any major daily American paper. Its editorial writers are outstanding, and provide generally great insight into world news. I read I must admit this paper occasionally and selectively, searching out the pieces that most interest me. I am simply not the person who really follows closely the business and economic news the WSJ provides. One small criticism is that I have never liked the format of the paper. I just do not like the way those very thin columns look.  But this is of course usually more than made up for by the quality of their content 
 This is a stellar version of a beautiful book, my very favorite in fact. Like most people, I am most often very disapointed when novels I love are adapted to the screen This film is one of the rare exceptions. Faithful to the book, Beautifully shot, expertly casted. Ralf Fiennes is the perfect Heathcliff,brooding, morose,obssesive, magnetic, jelous on an almost demented level. Juliet Binoche is Kathy flawlessly, wild and determined, together their chemistry is explosive.  Jason Riddington's performance as Hareton Earnshaw is heart breaking. this alone makes the movie worth watching. My only complaint and it's a small one, is that Juliet Binoche plays both Kathy Earshaw and Katherine Linton. It's slightly disconcerting, not to say she doesn't play it well. It's just a little hard to buy. However, it doesn't really hurt the story. This is all and all a fabulous treat of a film, whether you love romance, historical, or dramatic films it's perfct 
 The beginning to the experienced pasta maker will benefit from this book. Large, clearly printed, well outlined and containing lots of photos of the recipes, this book also has the "cooking school" format that has step by step photos. A entire chapter is devoted to dried pasta with photos of the different shapes. Never wonder what casereccie, banane, or grimigna are again! With this book, you will know! Imaginative use of fresh herbs pressed in sheets of pasta, cuisines from Italian to the Orient (and points in between), baked, stuffed, desserts, this book has enough ideas and recipes to get you started and keep you busy 
 My 6 year old absolutly adores Junie B.  Santa brought her the Leapter for Chrismas and Grandma gave her the Junie B game.  She only puts it down to go to sleep.  There are a few games (word searches and finding a Noun/Verb/Adjective and Great for 1st/2nd graders. It is a great learning tool.  The software is set up like the Junie B Jones Journal book.  If you child loves Junie B she will definetly adore the game 
 Dr. Isadore Rosenfeld steps forward to help those of us who may be in the dark concerning health problems, managed health care, or who may be locked into an insurance company that dictates treatment including physicians, and offers straightforward advice and guidance in order to educate patients as to what their rights are and what they should be asking and receiving.  This is an important book for Americans today 
 Look at the reviews of the Lello Gelato Pro 4090, Whynter makes them for Lello under a private label. Its a great Machine 
 This clock is great for people who sleep on their backs. If you happen to be lying on your stomach though, you have to turn over to see the time on the ceiling or reach over to the clock and press the snooze button to briefly turn on the clock light. I wish the clock itself had a lighted time display. Also we have 11 foot ceilings so the display is a little dim.   The snooze button is on top. It is big and easy to press but the button to turn the alarm off is small and on the front below the display. You have and grab the clock in an awkward way and hold the button down for a second to turn the alarm off.  The clock automatically set the time. I was impressed with this as we live near the bottom of an apartment building surrounded by other tall buildings with no clear view of the sky.  
 Words leave me speechless, speeches leave me clueless, clues are... oh drat! - if you find songwriter oriented pop with melody, harmony, muscular rhythm section, innovative guitar, keyboard and noise effects in the  tradition of XTC, 10cc, Cheap Trick, Kinks, the Who, Jellyfish..well this  group is for you.  Lots of bang for the buck - 17 tracks and not a trace of  filler.  So THIS is where the buzz about The Breetles came from. Brilliant,  a great album!  Can I buy it again 
 This book gave me a lot of great ideas for my Pampered Chef business.  It was very helpful with answering objections and working with my downline.  I only have 2 so far, but I will be better able to help them become successful.  I had to pace myself or I would have read the whole thing in one sitting 
 This book is killer.  Strongly recommended for all who enjoy action novels.  The author really knows how to spin an interesting web.  Give this a read,  You will not be disappointed 
 There are 64 reviews before this one. Average user review is 5 stars. So, whatever I write here is going to have a small influence on your judgment. Still I will show my presents in this world. I say this book is excellent. Don't waste time trying to find any better book about TCT/IP. Read this book. You'll be happy you did it 
 This is another breather album. I'm glad and proud to say that Bizzy still continues to do what is from the heart.Listening to B's last few albums has kept my love going for REAL hip hop. Though the production was lacking in his past albums; like most have criticized. I myself am able to look past that and see that this man is making music from the soul. If you listen to his music for what corporate rap has to offer you will be greatly dissapointed. Listen to his heart as he is able to spill it to those whom want to listen 
 In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, he paints the picture so vividly you feel like you are right there in the story. Very good and enjoyable reading. I could not put it down 
 Excellent book.  Highly recommend it if you are a "true" Goya fan. The author has a wonderful writing style and he assumes the reader has some basic knowledge of Goya's life and 18-19th century Spain. That is where the enjoyment of this book begins. Buy it now!! 
 This is a great movie if you like the life. They teach you how to outsmart the mob and come out on top. Harry & Moe want to be somebody but when they make a mistake it could cost them their lives. They take off to  Atlantic City and hide out from the mob bosses and from theirselves only to  find the true meaning of friendship and loyalty. Thank you Mr. Accavano! 
 Nine years ago when I was still a teenager, I obtained this book from my late Parish Priest in Yola, Nigeria. Hardly had I started reading it when I realised it was speaking to me as a person. Nouwen's introduction to the life of the Desert Fathers and the role Silence, Solitude and Prayer can have on our lives is thought provoking. This book has affected me in the most positive of ways. It is for everyone, for those busy with work, for those who go to Church, for those who frequent the bars...evreyone. This book would introduce a peaceful and calm spirituality to you - I highly recommend it and would not hesistate to give it a 10 star! 
  Honey is sweet, we love the taste / Medicine is bitter and hard to swallow  Beliefs are the honey and Truth is the medicine... isn't it convenient that we accept a belief for Truth...?   Fine book... 
 I originally ordered a Big Dot Board as a gift... but decided to keep it for myself. Now I'll need another! I'm impressed with its simple, yet versatile practicality. Highly recommended 
 I'm normally not one to laugh out loud very much, but with THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK I couldn't help myself.  I laughed so hard that not once but twice I had tears streaming down my face.  Norval Jones who's 4-F due to "the spots" is tragically in love with Trudy Kockenlocker.  She knows of his love, but is more interested in the poor boys going off to war.  One night after using Norval as a cover to get out of the house she goes partying with some soldiers, drinks too much spiked lemonade, bumps her head on a disco ball and ends up married to some guy she can't remember except that she thinks his name was Ratzkywatzky.  She's also pregnant.  Broken hearted she tells Norval and after a screaming fit he agrees to help her.  Hilarity and some of the craziest knee-shaking you've ever seen ensue.  Why is this movie not out on DVD?  Or even better yet a Preston Sturges box set!  D: Preston Sturges (HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, THE LADY EVE) W: Preston Sturges (HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, THE LADY EVE)  Norval Jones - Eddie Bracken (SUMMER STOCK, HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO) Trudy Kockenlocker - Betty Hutton (ANNIE GET YOUR GUN, INCENDIARY BLONDE) Emmy Kockenlocker - Diana Lynn (THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR, THE KENTUCKIAN) Constable Kockenlocker - William Demarest (THE LADY EVE, HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO 
 Insanely detailed.  The author shadowed Mr. Schlichtmann throughout the entire course of the case, giving the reader unprecedented insight into what goes on behind the scenes during litigation.  I can see why law classes use the book.  A must read for anyone going into law school 
 Franzen writes in such an evenhanded tone that it is hard to imagine anyone being mad at him.  He is by turns incisive, thoughtful, and intellectual, but his terrain is a personal one, in which he reflects on himself and his reaction to the modern world.  Hardly the stuff of polemics.  As the cliche goes, though, beauty is only skin deep and where I see at worst banal observations about Franzen's attempts to make sense of his disconnectedness from the world, he finds people who react to him negatively; those who call him an 'elitist' or an intellectual do not like the fact that he has used the word 'diurnality' in his prose.  Now, here's a curious phenomenon: Franzen, an author who seems quite at odds with the modern world, achieves success in the form of an endorsement from Oprah Winfrey.  Ophah Winfrey, who could hardly be less controversial and more banal than Franzen, endorsed his novel "The Corrections".  Suddenly, Franzen had more publicity than he had ever had before; a film crew wanted him to go back to his childhood house in St. Louis, and he started receiving hate mail, from those self-satisfied mensches in the midwest who do not like the "diurnality" in his prose.  What do we have here?  Well, I'm not an earnest person, and my admittedly cynical take on this whole scenario (which at once seems to befuddle and concern Franzen) is that many people who could charitably be called casual readers have their choices distilled for them by Oprah.  In general, this is an admirable goal; anything that increases the amount people read has to be a good thing if we accept that reading itself is intrinsically good.  But a unexpected problem arises when you are dealing with a person like Winfrey.  Winfrey is successful because of her safe banality; she does not, to use a cliche, push boundaries, nor does she demand much of her viewers.  Her "I'm Ok, you're OK" rhetoric has earned her millions, in both fans and dollars.  Thus, we have the endorsement of a novel like "The Corrections," which, as I understand it, explores the existential angst of three smug, self-absorbed urbanites who, in certain ways, pine for the quotidian pleasures that their suburban parents take for granted.  All well and good.  But, ahh, that writing.  The demands, the heavy use of abstruse words.  Why "diurnality"?  Why not just "daily" or some such other simple, immediately accessible word?  We want our reading like we want our Oprah!  Spoonfed to us so we know what to think, what to feel, and how to react.  Therein lies Franzen's troubles: he wants to be alone in the world, to think, to cogitate, to enjoy language and the written word, and, well, everyone else seems to want the artifice of American pop culture 
 With Pilates and various bodywork specialists springing up every time you turn around, it can often be difficult to get the simplest questions answered should one be interested in learning more about these practices.  In her first book, "Survival Skills for the Pilates Teacher", Ms. Conraths-Lange provided an accessible guide for both practitioners and consumers of Pilates work, providing background on the discipline, but also giving the newcomer a baseline to assist in setting expectations and results for each individual's process in undertaking this journey.     With her new book, "The Workbook for Inspired Entrepreneurs", Ms. Conraths-Lange has focused her attention to those who may want to go into this line of work as provider / practitioners.  If one is not blessed with a natural acumen for business, this book assists one in developing a realistic busiiness plan in order to provide the best bodywork services to your clients.  Helping to bridge form and function, bringing responsbile business advice in line with the many demands required to be an effective and successful entrepreneur in the field, this book provides a wealth of information and advice.  Not just for the business beginner, this book will have solid advice for anyone currently in the field.  
 Simple, yet beautiful text, lovely illustrations and an interesting shape of eleven inches long by seven inches wide, A Tree Is Nice is a very special book that I would recommend for all children.  The text is very reader friendly which builds up confidence.  My daughter is a picky reader but she can read this book.  She's just finished Kindergarten and they learned the popular two and three letter words which were called "popcorn words."  Sometimes I feel that was good and sometimes bad because often she doesn't want to R E A D other words (sounding them out.)  This is exactly where A Tree Is Nice comes in to the rescue! There aren't long, intimidating words for young readers.  It has the perfect length for my daughter so that she doesn't get frustrated and is isn't too easy or too short.   But the best part is the moral of motivating children to be "tree huggers" by realizing how beautiful and important trees are and appreciating the fact that so many of their childhood memories have to do with trees such as climbing them, picnicing under them, fishing by them, raking their leaves and jumping into the piles, swinging high on the swing hung on them and much more.  These memories will hopefully encourage them to plant trees (planting a tree is mentioned in the book) and tell their friends so they will go plant a tree too! The only thing missing to me is the science about trees such as the fact that trees clean our air. But I believe A Tree Is Nice is a great book for teaching our children to love this earth and contribute to it by planting a tree. This book can open the door for discussions about other good things for the earth such as recycling, conserving energy and eating organic foods. o8E Soar 
 I ordered this wine opener after seeing a friend use a similar opener.  Thing was, hers was $100 but came in a fancy wooden box.  This one has less of the extra packaging but works just the same.  Fantastic value and very easy to use.  Never again have to worry about a split cork or a snapped screw 
 i have the 1952 hard cover that was given to me by my father.after reading it twice i can see why it was his favorite book.tough man .very good book.it can still teach campers how to do it right 
 The book manages to be easy and fun to read while also backing up its statements with hard, well-documented facts (including footnotes, no less). A real eye-opener.  	At the time of the Bakker meltdown, I, like most  people, didn't look past Tammy Faye's make-up or the air-conditioned  doghouse before I passed judgment. I was a skeptic when I approached the  book. Now, I'm convinced Bakker didn't receive a fair trial.  	I may  never have read this book had the author not been a professor here at Drake  Law School, but I'm glad I did. I think that if you have any interest in  the subject at all -- no matter what your attitude toward televangelists,  Jim Bakker, the law, or religion in general --  you should read this book.  There's more to this story than the late-night TV jokes we all heard and,  unfortunately, believed 
 My little guy loved this from the start.  This is a versatile toy that lasted many months.  The mat is machine washable, so it became our take along for travel.  The hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere, such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows.  He's now 2 yrs, and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room!  This was a great investment 
 Maybe it was the four years of Latin in high school, or maybe I just like detective stories and historical novels.  In any case, I really liked this book!  I know enough about the period to find the historical details  fascinating, alhtough we seldom studied about the lower classes.  I'm  looking forward to working my way through the series.  I also liked the  interplay between Marcus Didius and Helena Justina in this one.  I enjoyed  Silver Pigs and Shadows in Bronze, but I have the feeling I'll be rereading  this one 
 I was a little hesitant about ordering this book at first for fear it would be dry and complicated.  I was very happy to discover it was neither.  It is well researched and well written. Warren gives you a good feel about the period and the challenges John faced. I even found myself asking "what would I have done in his place?"  This book busted a few of the "Bad King John" myths as well as some of the "Good King Richard" ones. This is a very readable book provided you have an interest and a little knowledge about the period.  If you are looking for a "Robin Hood" type story this isn't it.  It's not a page turner but nor should it be.  This is the story of a complex man during a complex time and Warren did a great job of bringing it to life without making it dull 
 This is a very important book.  Gross and Levitt are, respectively, scientists trained in biology and mathematics.  They are also broadly-educated individuals who are able to deal with postmodern (and other) challenges to science on those challenges' terms.  They have done considerable homework in preparing to write this book and some of their analyses of postmodern thought are among the most astute and crisp that I have seen.  Moreover, the book is eminently readable.  The style is firm but graceful.  Reading it is not only a pleasure in itself, but a reaffirmation of the possibilities and benefits of broad liberal arts education.  While the issues are current ones, the authorial voice is one of 'old school' erudition informed by deep humanity.  There is a danger that the book could be considered a polemic since its rhetoric is very direct.  Punches are not pulled; euphemisms are not substituted.  Nevertheless, while the book provides the pleasures offered by a great polemic it still enjoys the weight and point of serious argument.  It makes its scholarly case.  This is must reading for all who work in the humanities and social sciences and seek to understand the assaults to which science has been subjected as well as those assaults' etiology.  The continual question that haunts everyone confronting postmodern thought is, how can serious people believe such stuff?  This book provides a number of plausible answers to that question. 
 I bought this battery and charger combo as a birthday present for a young friend who recently got a digital camera. She complained that she was going through so many batteries so I gave her this battery/charger combo and she loves it. Now she spends a lot more time taking photos and less time replacing batteries 
 This is a high capacity card that can hold a ton of digi pix.  It's pretty fast when downloading info to my computer via the integrated USB device.  Not having to use an extra card reader is also a real plus.  The main downside is that it seems a bit flimsy when opening it to the USB connector.  I have to be very careful not to snap the thing in half.  Other than just being gentle with it, it's been a great purchase 
 I used this book, taken from a list provided, as the subject of a term paper for a college psychology class.  This was about 3 years ago, and it still takes my mind to a place of deep thought and reveals new insights.  This book was interesting to read, and the author discloses information (that is difficult to know of) in an objective manner which is not devoid of kindness and respect for all involved. I admire this author's work because it facilitated an authentic communication for me.  It allowed me to have a candid audience with teenage girls, and get a glimpse of what goes on in the mind, that before I had only seen the results of.  It helped me to understand what is behind the behavior. I was so impressed with this book that I told one of the high school counselors about it. He has the book now, I gave it to him.  This book isn't about blame and shame, it is about understanding and knowing 
 The review of new photo products are excellent. Well written in my opinion. Highly recommend this magazine 
 Bought this book for my grandchildren.  It is as delightful as I had been told.  
 It took me a while (not that long, thankfully) to get into Tilly and the Wall and ever since then I have been tapping my feet along to the beat. Their music, lyrics and tapping is refreshing and is the answer to today's boring pop music. I would say they are "indie pop". If you are looking for some music to sing along (loudly and proudly) in the car or to get your mood up this is the CD. Listen to the first track, if you like it than the CD is highly recommended since many of their songs have similar beats and sounds. There are some beautiful slow songs (Lost Girl), but some people have a hard time getting use to Derek's voice (the main guy's voice) since it is rather soft and scratchy. I had a chance to see them live and even though they were entertaining then, it did not do justice as shown on this album. I high recommend this to anyone looking to dance, need a mood lifter or just looking for a new kind of band to listen to. 
 If you want shaved ice, this is a bargain. Uses the molds or cubes. We use it all the time 
 I expected this book to be dense and incomprehensible, like I have found other of their books before, but the material is actually clearly presented, and not as terse as it may seem from a first glance. While not as comprehensive in coverage as Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, I find it easier to follow. As far as coverage of GR goes, it's succinct: I found it very helpful to work through this book before tackling MTW 
 I have to say out of all the books that I have read in urban fanasty, Kelley Armstrong is by far my favorite writer.  I recommend her books to everyone.  I have yet to be disappointed by any of them 
 Pure delta blues...electric and jammed out by one of the last remaining people who could sincerely play it.  (R.I.P. Junior) Honestly, this is one of the best delta blues albums ever made.  A lot of people have probably found Junior via RL Burnside....lemme tell you:  RL is fun....Junior was great. And that title...damn, is there a better name for a soulful blues album 
 This machine has fulfilled everything I wanted--speedy scanner, speedy copies, fax and computer printer.  The outfit I bought it from through Amazon sent the wrong one and were very easy to work with in rectifying the error.  The original ink cartridge only lasted one month, or  about 1000 pages; jury is out on that.   There are only three things that are drawbacks for my usage. One, the paper trays' limit to 250 is very very slightly annoying--not a big deal normally except when producing volume.  Second, the document feeder is noisier than my 1999 commercial-volume machine I got spoiled by. The noise of this one is probably no worse than any other in its product and price range. However, I now try to avoid phone conversation when the doc feeder is in use and audible through the phone. No big deal if you don't sit next to it, but I do.  Third, I have not been able to get it really dark or high contrast when copying a faint document (like pencil-written ones). If you plan to use it that way there might be some frustration; however, I have not sought customer service assistance with it yet.  I rate it a 4 and not a 5 simply because the doc feeder noise bothers me when I am on the phone nearby 
 When I was reading this book I often felt as if i was either there or the author was telling the story directly to me. My only objection is that it was too short! 
 This thing is super bright and my dog loves chasing it!  Even better for me, the AAA batteries it takes are a little easier to find than ones my last pointer hungrily demanded.  I recommend this product without reservation 
 First off I'd like to say too many people are giving her crap for her single, "Leave (Get Out)" by saying she is too young to write about this stuff. If anybody besides me actually looked into this, you would of found that the lyrics are about an older friend who was going through relationship problems at the time. Also, generations are changing. Try to remember that.  On another note, this CD is very good. The best tracks in my opinion are Baby It's You, Not That Kinda Girl, Leave (Get Out), Use My Shoulder, and Yes Or No.  Also, I am not a pop fan-boy. I mainly listen to DMX, Eminem, and 2Pac. This CD is great for a change though 
 The story along with the images! Grate.  Most of the books of its king feature only the plates with a brief description and the reader has to know the story to really understand and feel the image.  Colour reproduction is not the best possible though.  I have seen on the web the same images looking brighter and better.  All in all it is a good book to have 
 This isn't a novel that would be very enjoyable to someone who doesn't have much experience with other literary works of the 1920s.  Read alone it is pretty silly and vulgar.  Read -after- you have finished Sherwood Anderson's _Dark Laughter_, however, this book is very funny.  Hemingway spoofs both Anderson's style and his silly plot.  And throughout, EH offers a treatise on the art of parody.  The book is very short, and tightly controlled by Hemingway (something Anderson didn't get right with Dark Laughther).  The book is also interesting for those invested in the perennial Hemingway was/was not a racist argument.  Read alone, the bits about Indians would be highly offensive, but read in light of Anderson's horrifying primitivism and liberal use of the N-word in Dark Laughter, Hemingway's depiction of the Indians is really a chastisement of Anderson's silly racist story.  Hemingway's complex sense of humor, visible in his other novels under the surface, is fully on display here.  Too bad time has eradicated a fuller understanding of all the jokes.  I recommend this book for Hemingway aficionados and for students of modernism who need a wake-up call about Hemingway's place (and his understanding of that place) in the modernist canon 
 Big Joe Turner was the premier blues shouter of the postwar era and did everything from boogie-woogie and jump blues to the first wave of rock & roll.  Even those who have never heard Turner sing have heard "Shake, Rattle & Roll," which was specifically written for him by Charles Calhoun (Jesse Stone), but you probably heard the sanitized version that was popularized by Bill Haley and the Comets.  On "The Very Best of Big Joe Turner" you get to hear the original version, with its big bounce and raunchy lyrics.  You will also learn why you should associate the name Big Joe Turner with the idea of screaming rock & roll songs.  With this issue from Rhino Records, part of their series of reissuing classic blues and R&B material from the vaults at Atlantic Records.  What Rhino did was take a dozen tracks from Atlantic's "Big Joe Turner's Greatest Hits" and add another four tracks, "TV Mama" and "Midnight Cannonball," both of which were written by Turner, and "You're Driving Me Crazy (What Did I Do?)" and "Tomorrow Night."  The common denominator on those tracks is that they are more rock & roll than R&B, which is just fine with me.  The choice tracks are the rocker "Honey Hush," the aforementioned original version of "Shake, Rattle & Roll," "Flip, Flop and Fly" (which supposedly has leftover verses from "Shake, Rattle & Roll"), "The Chicken and the Hawk (Up, Up and Away)" and "Corrine Corrina," which has been done by everybody from Red Nichols to Dean Martin.  But then you will discover that the more you know about the early days of rock & roll the more you will realize you have heard covers of some of these songs by the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley.   Also, because this is Rhino, we are once again talking excellent liner notes, compiled this time around by Billy Vera.  The only complaint is that the cover picture of Big Joe Turner is actually the smallest picture of the singer I have seen to date.  Irony abounds.  The only reason not to give this album five stars is because there are Big Joe Turner collections that have more than 16 tracks on them, but I really like the selection here because my primary interest is in rockabilly and the early days of rock & roll more than the blues and R&B you get with some of the other collections, which are five star albums in their own rights.  Most of these songs were produced by Atlantic's Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler, which explains why there is a definitive sound here.  If you check out the 1956 film "Shake, Rattle & Rock" you can catch Turner lip-synching a couple of his hits, along with Fats Domino and the music of Frédéric Chopin 
 My dad got this book for me when I was seven. I'm now 20 and I still use it, although I lost the measuring spoons long ago. It's a very useful book to help your kids get started learning to cook, as the recipes included are not only tasty but also largely fun to make, and the instructions are easy and clear.  I like to consider myself a gourmand and this was my first cookbook, so that should tell you something! Highly recommended. It's also constructed of wirebound, plasticized pages, which is REALLY helpful in making it last for a long time instead of disintegrating the first time somebody spills an ingredient on it. 
 I am so happy to have found this coffee.  This dark roast is rich in flavor. A great cup of coffee brightens my day every day 
 this is an excellent book if you are working with different types of graphs or charts.  we use it as the bible while programming gui tools to create graphs.  if you are looking to make meaningful graphs, this book can clue you in to the different types of graphs that will best illustrate your data 
 The people Mr. Johnson addresses in this book are for the most part just that: busybodies of the most malevolent sort.  It's a rogue's gallery of people who were sure they could make heaven on Earth if only everyone else would wise up and do exactly as the busybody says.  Because, let's face it: Chomsky is a tool.  Lillian Hellman is a deceptive witch of the worst sort (anyone who has read Scoundrel Time needs to read Johnson's chapter on her), Rousseau showed people the hard way what governing with your passions will get you, and Marx got all the blood he hoped for, if posthumously 
 This book offers very practical advice in making the transition to free heel skiing. It is very well written 
 I'm all about providing support and tools for children to understand themselves. Our kids with Autism Spectrum Disorders and other neurological issues often have difficulty not only perceiving the emotions in others, but in themselves. Flooded with feelings of anger or frustration it's difficult at that moment to make good choices in regards to behavior. As I have three children with Asperger Syndrome myself, I have often faced the issue of explaining to them that they can make positive choices when overwhelmed with feelings. (To quote my son, "Nuh uh!") It is not the time to reason with a child when he is in the middle of a meltdown, which is why it is so important to empower him with ideas and skills over a period of time, and to have a plan as to how to implement a plan BEFORE she or he is melting down. That is where this very simply written book comes in. Having this basic plan for making positive choices when upset, can prevent meltdowns.  The Way to A provides children with a concrete tool for understanding how they feel and behave during certain emotions, and then with an adult helping the child problem solve, they can decide on different options for what may calm or soothe themselves. This book is ingenious in that it is covered with wipeable pages you can use a dry eraser marker on to use over and over. Ideally each child would have his own book, but because it is reuseable, it can be used for every child in a pre-school, daycare, or elementary school.   Parents would be well served to work through this little colorful book with their child in order to not only provide their child with the tools to learn self-management, but to problem solve themselves and to gain a greater understanding of what sets their child off, and what calms him. While most parents of children such as ours already know these things (parents are the experts on their child), to see it written down makes it more concrete and reminds us that we DO have strategies. This is empowering for both child AND parent.   I think this is a lovely book, and also quite cute. I can't wrestle it away from my 6 year old at the moment, but it would also be helpful for my 11 year old, and the strategies themselves, are excellent for my 14 year old. The saying goes, "First, know thyself." This is a step in the right direction for creating a lifetime of self-management.

 Mike Lesy has done a wonderful job of shedding light on a fascinating and tortured man. He gives voice to the face in the harrowing self portraits. Rizzuto finally gets his lastl wish. 
 Sampson doesn't pretend to write an objective history of Augusta National and the Masters.  This book is all about the crabgrass and bare spots in the fairway.  Picking and choosing his "facts" and with a colorful writing style, the author dumps on most everyone associated with Masters, Augusta National Golf (not Country) Club, and even the City of Augusta.  Though most of his venom is directed toward Cliff Roberts, the club's founder and original czar, even Bobby Jones comes across as something less than the golfing saint he's often portrayed to be. Interestingly, the last chapter of the edition I read introduces Hootie Johnson as the new club president, in whom Sampson seems to see a ray of hope.  Obviously, that chapter was written before Johnson's go-around with Martha Burke. 
 Berberick did an excellent job of conveying an evil character, while creating a believable map of Dalamar's descent into darkness. She captured the basic essence of Dalamar, but she didn't reveal so much as to take away the mystery that makes him so intriguing. I enjoyed reading this book, overall. It was a little difficult to get into, but, after a while, it the pace picked up 
 I picked this up on a whim, I had heard only the first single off the CD ("Ready to Fall"). Usually never buy a CD until hearing multiple songs, but I took a chance and was rewarded. I thought Rise Against's previous CDs were okay (I liked "Revolutions Per Minute"'s punk better than "Siren Song of the Counter Culture"'s hardcore) but this CD is really great. It's what I might deem intelligent punk; that is, punk that is a bit more thoughtful than the usual 3-chord stuff, but it's no less effective, energetic or enjoyable to listen to. The singer's voice is not whiny like so many other bands today. (I listened to Rise Against and AFI back-to-back, I like both bands but the difference is extremely noticable!) Favorite songs: Prayer of the Refugee, Good Left Undone, Roadside, Ready to Fall, Under the Knife. Note that you probably won't get the full impact of these songs from a 30-second clip, you'd have to listen to the whole songs to appreciate 'em 
 Yoga mats come in three basic thicknesses. At 1/8" this mat is of average thickness. At 24" x 68" it is also the standard width and length. Mats that are about half a thick as this one are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction. The thick mats (3/16") are about 50% thicker than this one and are designed for those who need or want extra cushion.   There are two sides to this and nearly all yoga mats. Look carefully at the 'bumps' on each side of the mat. The larger bumps are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands, feet, and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of alignment. The smaller bumps are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the yoga mat from sliding. Many mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand. This is typically, but not always, located on the 'up' side. The bumps will tell you for sure.   This yoga mat will increase in softness and stickiness with use. (So do most mats.) They start out mildly sticky and increase in stickiness the more they are used. You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process. Instructions for washing the mat are included. Once you've washed and dried your mat you're ready to begin! After using it for a while, if you find the mat decreasing in stickiness each time you pull it out, this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water. After washing, roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water, otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air. Then, air dry your mat unrolled, inside, and away from sunlight. (Hanging over the shower bar works nicely.)   When you first unroll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled. Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat (top outside once, then bottom outside next) or the end you start from (curled end once, flat end next time) and you'll find it straightening out more or less over time.   I recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them for you. I've worked in many studios and gyms over the years. Sometimes management has mats cleaned often, sometimes not. If you bring your own mat you always know where it's been. :o) Plus, owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home.   For my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee, I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body. This saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner. 
 I own several guidebooks on Ireland. This is the best book I've found so far on B&Bs. It is very comprehensive. I found the recommendations to be more thorough and offer a wider range of room rates than the Frommer guides. I think if you use this book and consult the forums on tripadvisor.com, it's really all you'll need to plan your own self-guided tour of Ireland.(I recommend a Michelin map as well) It's more than worth the price, will pay for itself over and over 
 A trip to Bodie, California, the incredible ghost town in the Eastern Sierras, sent me on a quest to find everything I could about the life and times of women in the 1840's on.  I was so amazed by the strength of these  women and the hardships they coped with.  It makes modern life with all  it's conveniences nearly obscene in comparison. The diaries demonstrate how  shielded these women kept of their intimate details.  The birth  and  pregnancies were rarely referred to, which is so unfortunate for it would  be fascinating to hear more of their experiences and their feelings of  having multiple life-threatening births. You do not have to be a student to  enjoy this book 
 I was having digestive problems throughout the day and night. I ate one meal a night, and it was a big one. I slept 2 - 6 hours a night and had problems waking up. I was lethargic all the time.  So my wife told me she was putting me on a new "food plan" that would help me address this.  In the first week I was craving more, much much more, at dinner. Most of the time I was angry and hungry. I accused my wife of secretly putting me on a diet. I hated eating vegetables. The second week was better. Still craved (and still do a little but now I can refuse) late night snacks but I slowly transitioned to wanting to eat throughout the day instead of forcing it down. I honestly did not like the menu items.  However, now months later, the dishes I didn't like before I look forward to eating now.   At the two month point I decided to take a vacation so my wife and I could kick start exercising (walking and hiking). We continued this when I went back to work. After the first month of exercising I decided to quit smoking. Success breeds success.  The bottom line: My digestive problems are all but over. I sleep better at night. My wife and I spend much more time together. And I feel much better about myself since I have lost 45 pounds to go from 200 to 155 pounds. I am thankful my wife found this book, put the time and energy to prepare the meals, and had the patience throughout it all. 
 In this book, chef and author Patric Kuh explores the rich history of fine restaurants in the United States throughout the twentieth century.  It is a story that takes you from La Pavillon to the Four Seasons, Lutce, and all the way to Le Cirque, Chez Panisse, and Stars.  More importantly, it tells the interesting story of the chefs and matre d's who have produced high cuisine in this country.  I wanted to read it for a few reasons.  First, I hoped that it would help connect the dots for me.  Any time you pick up a French cookbook, the authors tend to reminisce about restaurants and chefs they liked, but wasn't able to place them in any sort of context.  Second, I was interested in seeing where the author went with the book's subtitle: America's culinary revolution.  To me, the title implies that haute cuisine is dead.  For me, the book was successful on both accounts.  After reading it, I can finally place many great names and restaurants into their appropriate historical and cultural contexts.  For example, I knew that Troisgros was a great chef, but I didn't know where he fit into things.  As for Kuh's second point, I thought that his analysis was interesting, insightful, and subtle.  This doesn't mean that I agree with him.  If he wanted to show that haute cuisine is dead in this country, I don't necessarily think that he's correct.  The food hasn't changed terribly much, but the atmosphere of the gastronomical restaurant has undergone a revolution.  The exclusivity of haute cuisine, combinant with the notion that dining is meant to demonstrate class rather than seek pleasure, are two ideas that have lost popularity over time.  There are some things that I don't particularly like about the book.  Unlike other reviewers, I don't mind the manner in which the narrative is presented.  Yes, it might seem like rambling, but it does enrich the story.  What I don't like: 1.  There's so much French in the beginning.  If you feel the need to understand everything Kuh says, be prepared to read the book with your copy of the Larouse Gastronomique (what? you don't already have a copy? get one!) close at hand.  Specifically, many dish names are not translated.  This, of course, serves a point.  Earlier in the twentieth century, restaurants had menus primarily in French.  Today, many gastronomical restaurants have menus in English. 2.  I think the book would have been better if it had been longer.  In many instances, Kuh gives a glimpse of a name or a restaurant but then never explores it.  It leaves me wanting to know a lot more than the author gives me.  If you're reading the book for its historical narrative (rather than the foodie angle), you'll probably be frustrated that the author doesn't cast his net wider and deeper.  However, this book is ostensibly meant for ordinary people.  It isn't meant to be an academic work, and so it can't be criticized for not delivering.  All in all, this is a good book.  Don't be discouraged mid-course; the real gem of the book is the last chapter 
 It's been a chore being a fan of Stephen King's these last ten years. This stellar book made all the time and money I spent buying and reading such dreck as From a Buick 8 and Dreamcatchers worth the effort.  Lisey's Story bears a passing resemblance to Rose Madder in that both stories feature female protagonists who must escape into another world to escape the harm present in ours.  Lisey is much better than Rose.  For the first time in over a decade I can recommend a book King's written without hesitation.    Allow yourself to start this journey, and you'll soon be caught up in the spell of Stephen King's best work in ages

 Pépé, a notorious gangster from Paris, has been forced to seek refuge in the maze of Casbah where he evades the police's futile attempts to capture him.  During the police force's attempts to find a way to capture him,  the mobster Pépé continues to raid jewelry stores and steal whatever he can get his hands on, and when he is not on a robbery he spends his time with his lover, Inès, or plays card.  However, one night when Pépé is dodging the police's hopeless attempts to catch him, he crosses paths with Gaby Gould, a stunning Parisian woman.  This encounter opens up Pandora's Box for Pépé and he falls in love with Gaby who reminds him of ultimate freedom.  The score played in the film intensifies the perplexity of Pépé's situation that is further improved through cinematography, which produces a sense of entrapment.  In addition, the misé-en-scene and acting is of world class.  In end, Pépé Le Moko offers a spellbinding story, which at the end deliberately forces the audience to ponder the film's fundamental message 
 You hear this stuff and you notice the samples.  You also notice the carefree attitude.  Actually, you may even sense a far more dangerous and explicit attitude:  the point is that they [supposedly] don't care about the fanss or themselves.  That, in itself should be why you'll like them, so if that statement doesn't sound appealing, then they won't be.  Further, this band does rock hard.  Believe it or not, this screw-around band puts out the heavy.  Also, they do it well.  They do it with their own style.  And they also hate their former home state of New Jersey as well as tons of other things.  This album rocks, raps, blows your mind, makes fun of Mr. Rogers and his mailman from the show, and features a guest performance by Vanilla Ice [or here, Rob Van Winkle].  Like it, love it, or hate:  you will not bew indifferent to this work.  By the way, try to get the older version on Cheese Factory Records that includes the song Yellow Fever:  it is worth it 
 I got this book for my 10 year old son for his study of Ancient Rome.  What a wonderful book.  It has the depth of an adult book, yet is written at a young person's level.  The Latin and Greek roots and primary source quotes are an added bonus

 After following the advice in this book for four weeks, I'm within 20 pounds of my goal weight for the first time in five years.  I've done Atkins and South Beach, but my weight loss would always stall after the first two weeks.  Jim Karas' approach involves getting you to first believe that you can follow a sensible, effective weight loss program, and then he gives you the diet and exercise guidelines you need.  Yes, you will have to exercise, resistance/weight training is crucial, and you will have to follow an eating plan that asks you to burn more calories than you take in.  All I know is, I feel and look better than I have in years 
 The first reviewer hit it right on the head. This Loggins and Messina has many varied textures and arrangements. A little bit of Country(Long Tail Cat, Holiday Hotel), some good ballads(Till The Ends Meet, Golden Ribbons), and some good old rock n roll(Your Mama Don't Dance, Good Friend). Even throw in the corny but fun instrumental Just Before The News. Heck you can even appreciate the long jam Angry Eyes with the different instrumental solos. Loggins and Messina sure compliment each other nicely with their vocal styles. And the guys sound like their having some fun doing it. Certainly worth an investment 
 I received a copy of Protect Your Windows Network (PYWN) almost one year ago, and I immediately put it aside.  I figured it was another "security configuration guide," with lots of descriptions of settings and other tweaks that makes for boring reading.  Recently I decided to give PYWN another look, and I am exceedingly glad I did.  PYWN is one of the best security books I have ever read, and that includes nearly 200 titles over the last six years.  Incredibly, even non-Windows users will find plenty of sound advice for their enterprise.  Although the book is highly opinionated (and at times perhaps not on my side of the issues) I strongly recommend reading PYWN.    When I read and review books, I underline sections of interest and take notes in the margins and on separate sheets of paper.  I dried out a pen underlining text and took three pages of notes while reading PYWN.  The amount of good advice in the book is staggering.  PYWN is incredibly engaging and clear.  It is superbly organized, taking a layered approach to enterprise security.  The book's strength derives from the authors' consulting experience, and they deliver many stories based on their interactions with customers.  PYWN is not a Microsoft marketing person's dream, either.  In many places the book is very frank.  For example, p 19 says IPsec in Windows "is the poster child for user unfriendliness."  The authors correctly recognize the goal of a "protected" network by explicitly telling customers "no, your network is not secure" (p 15).  They are critical of "Return on Security Investment": "following the [security] policy does not increase revenue, it does not increase productivity" (p 116).    This book is definitely not afraid to offend the reader.  I do not mean the use of foul language; rather, the book takes very strong stances on certain subjects.  Some of these directly contradict guidance given by others.  Ch 12 even features 10 Security Myths.  In many cases, I believe the authors take the right position, and they adequately defend their assertions.  In other cases, I must disagree.  The authors are not fans of detecting intrusions, and their monitoring advice in Ch 4 is particularly shaky.  They also tend to use an example of compromising a host-based IDS deployment as an excuse to attack all detection mechanisms.    The authors are sticklers for accurate language, which I believe is required in our field.  They are keen to point out that "IPSec tunnels" don't exist per se; there is, however "IPSec transport mode" or "IPsec tunnel mode."  They repeatedly state that L2TP+IPsec is the only "IETF-approved" remote access solution.  This stems from their requirement that such a solution authenticate the user and give his/her machine an IP address.  Obviously IPSec alone doesn't fulfill those requirements, hence their promotion of an alternative.    In some cases this desire to use the right word doesn't work so well.  I disagree with some of the terms used in the threat modeling discussion in Ch 9.  I wonder why the authors (and other Microsofties) call this "threat modeling," instead of using Bruce Schneier's older term -- "attack trees."  Sometimes the authors confuse threats with vulnerabilities.  For example, p 237 says "Although a threat to an application many times can be eliminated with a patch..."  That should read "Although a vulnerability in an application many times can be eliminated with a patch..."  Threats can only be eliminated by incarceration; vulnerabilities are flaws which can be patched.  On p 254 we read "the config.sys file poses no threat."  That's right, but it's not what the authors meant.  They should have said "the config.sys file poses no vulnerability," or perhaps "exposure."  Finally, p 236 says "you use the model to communicate the current structure of the network and the threats created because of it."  That is wrong; building a network doesn't create threats -- it creates vulnerabilities and exposures.  Threats are independent of the network.  Similarly, the STRIDE model on pp 242-3 is mostly about attacks, not threats.  Read any government report about threats to learn about organized crime, foreign intel services, script kiddies, corporate spies, and so on -- those are real threats.  "Denial of service" is an attack; "information disclosure" is a security incident, or a consequence of an attack.    I should note that sometimes the Windows focus of the book blinds the authors to other, better security approaches -- some of which Microsoft is adopting.  For example, Ch 14 recommends users "uninstall unnecessary components."  This is obviously true, but it's a limitation of Windows.  It's much better to start with a bare system and "add necessary components."  On p 422 the authors say the Windows Backup Operators group are unsafe for backup.  If that is the case, why do they exist, at least as currently configured?  The advice in Ch 14 also results in an "unsupported configuration" for SQL server.  The authors admit this is for "high security" needs, but this indicates a problem with Microsoft's approach.  PYWN pulls no punches in some places regarding Windows, but in others it holds back.  PYWN is definitely not a security configuration guide, of which the authors are highly critical.  In some places they do list ways to accomplish certain goals, but most everywhere else they refer readers to previously published books or documents on the Web.  Bravo.  The book contains numerous footnotes which I appreciated.    I found only a few errors in the text.  On p 38, the text implies the three way handshake starts with SYN, ACK instead of SYN, SYN-ACK.  On p 84; ISO is not "International Standards Organization."  On p 121, the text implies SOX doesn't apply to all publicly traded companies.  Since I read every word very closely, I am really impressed by PYWN.  This review is long enough.  Let me conclude by saying you will absolutely not waste your time reading this book.  It took me a week to finish it because I tried to make the best use of the authors' recommendations and insights.  Keep my earlier comments in mind, then enjoy PYWN.  I hope the authors produce a sequel or at least a second edition.  They are exceptional writers, and this book could easily be called "Protect Your Computing Enterprise."  Windows is an example implementation, not necessarily the core focus of the book 
 I've read them all, and all of the good ones make the points presented in Undefended Love, namely, that the place to begin working on any relationship is with yourself. But no other book says it so well, so clearly, and in such a slim readable book. Get it. Read it. DO the exercises. Do them with or without your partner. What you'll learn is that you can feel better and be better right here right now and it is all in your hands. 
 Stargate Atlantis is in my opinion, the best Scifi show out there.  The look and feel of the show is amazing, and the characters have depth and appeal.  Remember to watch the show LIVE in the U.S. too, that's the only way the ratings will count!  Remember, we have to keep the ratings up to get the show renewed for further seasons 
 I am reading this book page by page with my 9 Yr. old daughter. It is giving us our personal time, while also instilling the love of reading. We are both traveling to the same places together and enjoying the lives of all the characters in the book. Wouldn't you love to play in a Secret Garden of your own? We would 
 Just for the readers information I am a Ministry and Theology freshman major in college.  I choose this book to do a review on; and I gave the book the typical stereotype of being just another boring book about Psychology, but I was proven wrong.   Martin E. P. Seligman uses many examples and explains what he writes for those of us who don't have a large vocabulary.  If you need a book that explains the facts and opinions about helplessness, then Helplessness by Martin E. P. Seligman is the book for you 
 Good toy. Soft, cuddly, well made. My kids love the Webkinz and the website. They are very happy with the cocker spaniel toy 
 This is my second favorite album of 94' right behind Illmatic and in my top five of favorite albums of all time. This showcased some of the best and most thought out rhymes I have heard in years. Mc's like this are few and far between these days. This album hits the mark without the club banger and gangsta gimmick. And DJ Premier's production is nothing short of phenomanal. This is one of the few albums I can completely listen through. Even from the intro, the replayed drum and dialouge from The Fist of the Northstar. Jeru drops those rhymes for the streets on "Come Clean" and D. Original. Come clean you gotta love that beat, and the replayed elements off "throw your gunz" from Onyx. "You cant stop the prophet", Jeru boasts his storytelling skills. But its not just the storytelling, its the concept of the track itself. "Aint the Devil happy" is another bangin track about knowledge of self also. My personal favorite has to be "My Mind Spray". This track is short, sweet, to the point, and Jeru was just on point on the mic period. And the beat is by far one of my personal favorites.  I had this on tape for years when I was younger. I bought it again on CD July of last year and its been back and forth, from my ride, to my pad everyday since then. I listen to this album almost everyday together with Illmatic, Live and Let Die, and Sex and Violence. These 4 albums are my favorites and greatest of all time to me. If your looking for some good rap I highly recommend this album. This is timeless material. Most of you of this new generation of rap is not going to feel this album. This album is for those who appreciate true thought out rhyme skills, and artist that do this for the love and respect of the love culture 
 My son is an avid Castlevania game player.  I bought this game for his birthday.  I asked him how he liked the game and these are a few of his comments: He likes how it offers the use of the touch screen to shatter blocks that are in the way and also to draw symbols that open doors and help defeat certain boss monsters.  Some monsters have abilities that you can equip while others can be summoned to help you battle.  The game provides a good variety of weapons and armor.  There are hidden items and the challenge of getting all types of monster souls that makes the game more interesting.  He was planning on buying this game for himself and was very pleased to get it as a gift. 
 This is not only the ideal scope for beginners but enough of an instrument to show you new things in the sky for years to come. It is sturdy and simple to operate. It has enough light-gathering power (more important than magnification) to reveal dim star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies and good enough optics to show you the surface of planets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars. Affordable as this scope is, there is no reason to give so much as a glance at the numerous trashy 60mm refractors with exaggerated magnification claims that litter the market.  Some advice on selection. Dobsonians like this one come in a range of sizes. A 114mm (4 ½") is a bit on the small side but still a fine instrument, especially if your ability to carry large objects is limited. A 200mm (8") scope like this one is right in the middle of the recommended range. A 250mm (10") is on the big side, and you should buy one only if you are able-bodied.  Some advice on use. Viewing through a telescope is less like playing a CD and more like playing a guitar. Finding objects takes a little bit of practice. To simplify it, I would suggest discarding the finder supplied with this scope and installing two finders: a 50mm "crosshair" finder plus a red-dot finder to aid in initial pointing. You will also need to buy an atlas (Sky & Telescope's Pocket sky Atlas is the best available), a red flashlight to view the charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision, and a guidebook to lead you to interesting objects. These investments will greatly add to your enjoyment.  What more can I say? This is the kind of scope that experienced observers have been trying to steer novices towards for decades. Although, I recommend that you do your homework before buying any scope--learn the sky and get to know experienced stargazers who can advise you--when it comes time to purchase, you could hardly do better than this scope.  For more advice, see my encyclopedic guide here on Amazon, "So you want to buy a telescope. 
 This book has something for everyone.  The anecdotes are charming, funny, and full of deliciously descriptive sentences.  I read some passages aloud to whoever will listen.  This is the 2nd book I've read by Peter Mayle. I also read "A Good Year" and am currently reading, "Toujours Provence!"  Mayle's books are refreshing and delightful to read 
 I have read thousands of books on a variety of topics and scores of books concerning UFOs/Flying Saucers/Aliens. This book rates in my top ten for this genre. Jim Marrs did a great job. He provides thorough research references/footnotes etc. so you can pursue the interesting topics that he uncovers in more depth. Anyone interested in alien intelligence on this planet should read this book. As a result of this pleasant reading experience, I have purchased his other books and am looking forward to examining what they contain. 
 This movie helps brings to life what you have read in the Bible about John and future world events. You must see this movie 
 I don't really know what I can say about this book, but I'm sure I'll find the words... Nevermind, I have them. If you pick it up and expect the Disney movie, you're in for one of the biggest surprises of your life. At the beginning it seems to start out slowly because some of the characters introduced weren't in the Disney movie at all, so you're like... "oookay, who are these people?" However, this book was so great. It was very sad and depressing, but it had it's happy moments, which is always nice.   It was amazing, and one of the best books I have ever read. Disney is a butcher of good stories!!! Arg! (This, however, is just my opinion. If you're a fan of Disney and I have offended you, I do apologize.)  I loved his writing style, with how descriptive he is with the setting and the characters. Victor Hugo does it so well that you feel like you are actually in Paris in the 15th century, and that you actually know the characters. They were portrayed so much differently in the book. My favorite character was Dom Claude Frollo, and I thought that I would have hated him, especially since he causes virtually all of the horrible suffering in the story. Weird, huh? I also liked Quasimodo for his kindness despite how unfortunate he is. He's constantly ill-treated, but he still keeps his good-natured soul.  I'm sure I'll be picking up copies of some of Victor Hugo's other books soon as well. The ending of this book brought me to tears, but I don't know about anybody else, since nobody I've talked to has read it.   I'm the sort of person who cries easily, and I became very attached to the characters. This book is filled with death, but some of it made me smile. I loved the ending even though it was tragic, but I won't spoil it. Go read it yourself. Not all stories can end happily 
 This was an interesting read for me, even more than Holy Blood, Holy Grail. He had some plausible theories, but he either couldn't or didn't prove them.  That didn't take away from my interest.  A lot of Christianity is based on faith.  Oh we say it is based on scripture, but I am finding with some digging that a lot of what we claim is scripture-based just isn't there.  In the long run we believe what we choose to believe.  I recommend this book for its mind expanding theories, but don't read it if you can't stand to have the things your religion teaches challenged 
 Gloria Page's book not only offers good technical instruction but helps bring a sense of fun and relaxation to stamping. Her projects can lead to many variations so the book will be useful for years to come. She is generous in showing how she has made products that she has successfully sold over the years. Readers would find her other book, "Holy Moly Mackeroly!" very inspiring also, although it is not exactly a "how to" book. Highly recommended 
 THIS IS A VERY FUNNY KIT.THE OUT MEAL IS SO REAL AND THE BAG TO PUT THE FOOD IS THE BEST 
 As an avid reader, I find this book more of a resource than a "sit and read".  Each chapter (and hence topic) provides a list of books that delve more deeply into the area presented.  The Christian foundation for this book is evident throughout.  It works well with its companion "What Every Mom Needs" 
 Thank you for asking.  You know I sent for this book during a very busy time for the Post Office; yet I got the book quickly and in fine shape.  I really needed it when I got it.  I had to give an overview of church bookkeeping and accounting to my church last week.  I used the book to outline my presentation to the Finance Committee!  I was a hit, thanks to the book.  They appointed me bookkeeper for the church.  I told them that I could not accept the position on a permanant basis.  I did accept it as a tempt until they get a permanent (younger person--I'm 76).    Since you have been sooooooo nice, could you recommend a Basic Accounting book that I could use as the church's bookkeepper?  I would like to give our small church (300-350 people) some good accounting methods/principles. The Basis Accounting book should be for just basic accounting, not church accounting or bookkeepping.  I just got that from you.  You're great. Thank you sooooo much, George Mucherso 
 This is in reference to the version illustrated by D. Duntzee--some of the reviews here were a little confusing on that point.  This version is the time-honored story by H. C. Andersen which I grew up hearing.  The illustrations are really lovely and my two little girls just adore this book.  If you have a library of classic children's stories, you should add this book to it--it's wonderful! 
 No matter what your media, you need to consider having a good photographic record of it.  This lets you keep a "portfolio" of prints handy, rather than trotting out the bulky originals; send slides to shows and galleries; keep a record of works you sell or give away; and provides the basis of making prints.  The how-to is excellently done:  I got good results from my first roll.  It cost a couple of hundred dollars to get started, in SLR camera body, lenses, tripod, and film, but you can't buy a good easel for that -- about what a big assortment of pastels runs 
 This is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of American foreign policy. A year after this book was published, there were over a hundred reviews. Regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author, finds the author right or wrong, interesting or boring, this book is one of the most influential books, if not the most influential book that affected American foreign policy. In fact, the current Bush Adminstration's policies, George Kenan's containment, Henry Kissinger's policies as well as countless adminstration's policies are shaped or affected by this book. My area of study is the foreign policy of Post World War Two American governments, and never have I understood it with greater clarity after I read this book. It is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations, differing on extent. (I studied the policies first and read the book the year after). It is a fascinating book and hard to put down. The author writes in a European style (beautiful long sentences,etc.), which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read. He tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically. Ms. Rice and Mr. Kissinger were heavily influenced by this book. To understand them, this is a must read. In and of itself, it is an excellent book, a classic, and thousands others significantly more qualified than I have reviewed it. Look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists 
 Truly inspirational and provides valuable thoughts and insigths on the merging of art with the craft of photography. Invaluable tool and on a simple level great for staring. Could even be treated as a coffee table book !! 
 From the day I missed my period up until now with only a month to go until the birth, hardly a day has passed that I haven't consulted this book for something. It is information-packed, yet readable; reassuring, yet realistic; and gives a balanced perspective on potentially controversial things like homebirth and prenatal testing. Like most of the Sears books, it does have the unfortunate tendency to assume that its audience is made up of women in traditional, male-as-breadwinner marriages, and it does get overly corny at times. But those minor problems are easy to overlook in light of how terrific the rest of the book is 
 Somehow this CD recaptures memories that you never thought you had. The combination of Buddy Jewell's powerful range of vocals, some nice melodies and lyrics that trascend time, result in some sweet listening. "The Downtown Matinee" revives some memories of watching the double feature on a Saturday afternoon, maybe listening to Hank on the way home and feeling free with your whole life still in front of you. The songs have a nice range of sounds and stories with some of the arrangements reminiscent of Clint Black, the Eagles, and even Jimmy Buffet. The entire CD is suggestive of Hank Williams except with better vocals (forgive me). This is new old country at its bes 
 This book should be read by all women and men alike who are considering  marriage, or are married.  The truth is spoken in the  pages of this book,  simple plain truth about marriage! What the Word of God has spoken on the  marrige union, and how we are to "Have A Marriage Without  Regrets"  Take the principals of this book and put them into practice  and see God change your marriage. Read it, apply it, live it out, and watch  your dull,I don't love you anymore, I want out marriage into a marriage  with God in the center 
 We have just returned from a four-week trip to Costa Rica. We bought three guides to plan the trip: the Moon Handbook, Lonely Planet, and Footprint. Of these the Moon Guide was by far the best. Author Christopher Baker has a great way of identifying interesting places to stay, eat, and visit and helping the reader visualize what they are like. As a result we discovered mnay exceptional places to stay and found that his desciptions were right on target. If you are planning more than a one-week quicky to Costa Rica this is the guide to plan your trip 
 My husband stated that these were the most comfortable shoes he's ever worn.  The soft leather is so flexible that he feels like he's wearing slippers, and for the moderate price, it's absolutely worth purchasing 
 I also have this album on LP 331/3 which I purchased when I was  10 years old when it was first released in the stores . Great  LP, Great Artist , One of the Best ! the Patsy Cline of the  Male Singers. It was a tragedy that he died at such an early time in his short lived career. He would had been a bigger star than Hank Williams !!! Or anybody else !!! A Legend !  His Songs will live forever !!! 
 This is essentially a large collection of Wally cartoons and the various antics of the character. The foreward by Scott Adams gives the full story of the Pacific Bell individual--known as "Wally Version 1.0"--from being duped by weasals, to the unique position that WV1.0 was put in by management, to his antics upon stumbling across the golden parachute for the lowest 10% of employees. Though some of the comics are shown in other collections, quite a few I have not seen before in my other Dilbert books--particularly a number of older Wallyisms. Overall, a very good addition to anyone's Dilbert collection 
 I am traveling to Oxford soon and a friend gave me book two in this new series to read.  I so enjoyed that one I had to have book one which was just as good a read.  I cannot wait for book three! 
 As an armchair mathematician, I can't remember how many times I'd read books that said things like "The prime number theorem, the proof of which is beyond the scope of this book, shows that the average number of primes less than any integer, n, is approximately n / log n."  What a remarkable, intriguing statement!  I was thrilled, therefore, to finally come across Professor Jameson's book, which is a proof of this theorem - no more, no less.  Well, slightly more: he includes some interesting applications of the theorem, too.  The book is extremely well organized.  It presents all necessary background material for the proof, and it does so in a refreshingly lucid manner.  Topics are all well-motivated, and Jameson moves smoothly between them.  He provides enough expository comments to guide the reader through the proof, but at heart this is a book of mathematics.  I appreciated its utterly thorough proofs of all its statements, but those put off by equations will not enjoy this book.  Personally, the going got a little tough towards the culmination of the proof, around the midpoint of chapter 3.  Those with a stronger background in analysis will doubtless find these sections easier to absorb.  Overall, this is a beautiful book.  It clearly presents the theorem and the deep, subtle links between number theory and analysis.  I highly recommend it. 
 There is, so far, no better or more mature book on moral cosmopolitanism than Appiah's Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers. In it, Appiah makes plain, by well-crafted appeals to the reader's good sense that are replete with ethnographic examples and real-world insights, what romantics and theologians have been telling us for ages: There is but a hair's breadth of difference between us; a tiny space that we can fill with causes for consternation and hatred, or with salutary joy at considering that difference. This Appiah does without in any way suggesting that there can ever be an end to the moral and cultural tensions that those differences do and must invite. He sketches the tenable cosmopolitanism we have been waiting for, and he parts company with the sentimentalist versions that remain - and should remain - in the shallow end of the pool.  Appiah, here as elsewhere (The Ethics of Identity), marvels that so many intellectuals have distorted the truth about the key insights of cosmopolitans, and he takes them to task. These have argued that cosmopolitanism contains an incredible and/or dangerous set of normative proposals and disregards the "facts" of human nature (that we are an insular species, with a territoriality that is red in tooth and claw). Appiah deftly replies that it is the cultural conservative, the jejune jingoist or nationalist, the duped hyper-contextualist, whose view of the world and of human nature is distorted, for the history of human social, cultural and even sexual intercourse is replete with cross-pollinations of language, religion, art, dress, rites, metaphysical outlooks, and progeny, all bespeaking an enormous aptitude for cooperation, bonding and friendship. We are an inter-cultural, intertwined, and interdependent species, just like every other on the planet. The view of ourselves as culturally isolated is the view that bears the burden of proof. It is, in fact, demonstrably false.  Appiah laments that so many philosophers and intellectuals, adopting a bad historicism, have argued, falsely, that we humans can only see the world up to the point of our own contextual "walls." He joins many - George Lakoff, Martha Nussbaum, William Sloane Coffin, Mohandis K. Gandhi, R.W. Emerson - in arguing that the greater truth of our humanity is our ability to imaginatively think new thoughts, to reconsider plans of life, to fashion new worlds of possibility, while acknowledging that each of us has a home that we should cherish, improve, perfect, and defend.  However, I in turn lament that this volume has failed to address what continues to go missing in normative literature - the role of love in moral imagination. For it seems to me that it is love - a word we are so often afraid to use in our secular and public discourse - that has the most power to make proper use of that hair's breadth of difference that we often find so important, that we are so ready to murder and maim for - where we, sometimes and lamentably, lend credence to those who would see us as best understood as having natures that are red in tooth and claw. I would like Professor Appiah to consider this a challenge, a challenge to write one more book to overcome what I perceive as this volume's single, but important, failing. I make this challenge because, once this failing is remedied, his body of work will have provided us with a full circle of mature cosmopolitan thought in the contemporary world. 
 I have many E&M texts primarily because there are so many nuances to learn and I find it important to have different points of view.   However, the Balanis text does something the others doesnt.   It covers a great deal of ground and puts the multitude of equations into a 'BOX' for easy reference.   And all these equations are derived in a very straight forward fashion so a person can remember them and understand their basis.   Most texts have the equations all over the place and when trying to solve problems you wonder where to look next.  Not so with Balanis.  In fact, I have definitely been able to solve E&M problems now after reading his book then I could do before it.   If E&M is your field this text is a must 
 This is an unrevised reprint of David Khan's 1978 study.  It has stood the test of time very well although, inevitably, some material is a bit out of date, for example on ENIGMA.  Still, the volume stands as a thorough analysis of the whole panoply of intelligence with which nazi Germany fought world war two. And no-one today would dispute the findings about why Germany performed so badly in the secret war.  Hitler underestimated Russia, awaited the Sicily landings in the Balkans and fell for thinking that the Normandy landings were a feint.  As Khan makes clear,  the nazi high command underestimated intelligence, thinking that only tanks, armies and airplanes mattered to achieve a result.  Hitler in particular was unjustifiably arrogant and failed to fund properly spying activities in foreign countries.  It was not until mid 1942 that all mail transiting through Germany was opened as a matter of routine.  Obviously, German intelligence did have its successes, say in penetrating Resistance movements in occupied Europe and in the early Atlantic U boat campaigns;  Doenitz was one of the few nazi leaders to understand the importance of spying. But the hierarchical political structure of the Reich and the disdain of the officer class failed to capitalize on secret information which could have made the war's result more problematical 
 Characters are pretty numerous but not so many we can't keep up with them.  Clare, the main character is a divorce therapist who lost her husband in a tragic accident.  Dory (short for Isadore) is her best friend; Dory's husband Son Rogers is wealthy and is not Clare's best friend.  Haley is Clare's daughter, whose husband Austin is a real jerk.  Two men are romantically interested in Clare: Lex, a Yankee from Maine who owns a marina; and Rye, who is old Fairhope and a close friend of Clare's dead husband Mack.  Add to this a few honest-to-goodness characters like the bird lady/mother-in-law and her strange old boyfriend Cooter and you have a colorful crowd of believable characters.  The plot of the novel belongs to the three women, Clare, Dory, and Haley--their actions, relationships (especially with each other), their reactions move the chain of events in very Southern ways.  Ways, we may know something about:  manipulation, mysteriousness, emotional highs and lows, and amazing courage and sensitivity.  This is a wonderful novel whose theme seems to be importance of seeing life as a journey with its crossroads; however, I prefer to think its biggest message is the strength of friendship between women.   
 I built computers as a side-business and I have owned HD's from all the maor companies. So, I know what a good hard drive has. This one is superb. The speed is astoundidng due to the sata 300 and the 16mb cache, reliability is excelelnt and its whisper silent. Definitely reccomen 
 In the realm of UFOlogy, this book was not only one of the first, but also one of the best reports ever written on the subject.  I first read it in the early 1950's, and believe me, it is perhaps the one book that fueled my interest not only in UFO's but in all forms of Fortean Phenonema, both past and present for the last fifty-three years.  No fadism in the pages of this excellent tome - just cold, hard, and well researched facts about a subject that is now more popular than when this book was first published in 1950. 
 I won't go into a very lengthy description or recommendation. Let me just say that this book contains many quality photos of some of the more spectacular finds from the Mayan culture. If you have a lot of this type subject material lying around, this book has some photos I have not seen anywhere else. The book has excellent paper and binding and should give a long shelf life as a reference piece in your collection. My grand-kids love the large pages 
 Excellent source for those seeking revelant information on world missions.  I recommend this text for universities as well as local church congregations who desire to learn more about missions and what I believe Christian are called to accomplish in their lifetime.  
 Edward Banfield's reputation was built on the basis of this book and the research that informed it. While I am confident that he added significant value in his work and writing subsequent to this effort, I am equally confident that in the minds of most of Banfield's fans, at least those with whom I have discussed this book, he was defined by this work. The Moral Basis of a Backward Society is an exceptionally powerful ethnography describing what happens when there is no "community" even in what is described and thought of as a community, as in the village that serves as the backdrop for this book. Outstanding lessons are observable in this work that are transferable to our current society. When we decide we will work together, there are few limits to what we can accomplish. When we fail to do that, all of us, and the community spirit suffers 
 I purchased this movie as a birthday gift to my wife who loves "old" movies especially musicals. She watched "I'll See you in My Dreams" last week and found it to be a most entertaining show - 4 stars 
 I haven't gotten a chance to really delve into the book yet.  I just got it six hours ago, but from leafing through I can tell that readibility is not an issue.  The font is some of the clearest I have seen on any book.  Perhaps I have a more recent printing, but I noticed quite a few people seem to knock it for that.  Just wanted to say that you can buy with confidence.  From bavorite anyway 
 i've had this deck for a few weeks now.  overall, i absolutely love it.  i suppose it was the artwork that originally drew me to it.  as someone who was "raised" on the rider-waite, the deck is really easy for me to read.  the imagery and symbolism exactly follows that template.  i believe anyone even remotely familiar with the rider-waite will be able to use this deck immediately.  the more i use the deck, the more i love the art.  it seems to jump off the surface of each card - the colors are vibrant to the point of intoxication, and i really like the style.  some may find it a bit sterile - it clearly is computer generated.  but i have always liked the crisp and clear lines of cg art.  perhaps because as i age, my eyesight isn't what it used to be, and that softens the edges a bit.  on the down side, i found some of the cards to be "muted".  the three of swords is one example.  i like my three of swords to hurt, i like to see dripping blood from the heart, i like to feel pain when i see this card in a reading.  while the guilded version approximates that, i find it falls short in getting the job done.  it's just too neat and tidy.  a broken heart is messy business, and this card should reflect that.  the ten of swords is another example.  the swords merely hover over the figure in the card.  doesn't quite do it for me.  the five of pentacles is yet another example.  i love robin wood's version of this card - i can feel the despair and the cold chill in the air when i look at that card.  in the gilded, all that emotion lies somewhere behind the image, and i find it difficult to bring it out.  perhaps it's only my own interpretation of the five of pentacles that colors my perception of the card in this deck, but again, i think the imagery should be a bit more graphic.  on the other hand, the muted imagery would make for a perfect "all purpose" deck for public readings.  there's only a few cards that even approach nudity - the high priestess as one example, and it's just her dress that's kind of see-through; she's actually not nude.  the lovers show a woman in what appears to be either a bikini or a thong and bra.  lots of skin but no nudity.  the tower shows a man's rear, but i don't know that most people would see that as "obscene".  and finally, the star is really the only card that shows unclad breasts.  though the dark blue coloring obscures that from any casual glance.  again, the lack of nudity speaks to the "muteness" of the deck's imagery, but the fact that i find the deck to be a little "toned down" doesn't necessarily mean it's somehow "less than" decks that are more graphic.  i definately find this level useful.  i really like how the black background works so well with the art.  i think that helps the art to "pop" off the card.  it also helps to counter the muted symbolisms.  for anyone who does well with traditional rider-waite decks, the gilded tarot is a perfect alternative.  i think this deck would make for a great beginner deck as i find the symbolism easier to read than even the rider-waite itself.  and for those who like cg art, there's enough in the cards to satisfy even advanced users.  as far as i'm concerned, this deck rates my highest reccomendations 
 I was thrilled with this cd. It had all of my favorite songs from when I was young. Defiantely brought some wonderful memories back. Even my husband loved it 
 If you have any interest in modelling domains, then you've probably already read, or are planning to read, Martin Fowler's Analysis Patterns. The models here share some overlap with that book, but this is a gentler introduction, so I would recommend this book for a beginner, before they read the Fowler book. A more experienced modeller should probably consider this as a catalogue of off-the-shelf models.  This book covers modelling enterprises - e.g. businesses and government agencies, and the relationships between their employees, organisational structures and the products and services they provide.  The fundamental models applicable to enterprises are covered here: the business itself, its employees and their positions; the products they produce and the equipment used to produce them; the activities carried out to produce the products; and the contracts between a buyer and seller that deliver the products and services. Later chapters cover some more specific examples, including accounting, laboratories, and manufacturing.  It is true that the models aren't very detailed, but that's the point of the book - for pretty much any enterprise, these models can be used as starting points, while covering most of the relationships that are likely to be encountered. It's true that you won't get any advice on actually converting the models to a database or an object oriented design, but that's beyond the scope of the book.  While an expert modeller won't find the in-depth treatment they might be looking for, I would definitely recommend this to a beginner. Unfortunately, there's no insight into the process of decomposing a domain, although the last chapter demonstrates wide applicability of the models by applying them to a theatre. What you do get are lots of simple examples of the finished output, which will provide inspiration, even if you have no particular interest in the enterprise domain itself. 
 This is one of the best sci fi animes out there and the colour transfer and quality of the DVD picture is smoking! The storyline seems better than the first season but I didn't really like how the two disc stick on top of each other! Other than that everything else is fine 
 This book gives us the keys to not only improving our relationships, but transforming them into celebrations. Through mind expanding ideas such as appreciation as a spiritual practice, commitmitment to self and others, the Hendricks elevate relationships to the ideal of fun-filled triumphs. They remind us we are here as Divine Beings to serve all, ourselves and our partners, relatives and acquaintances.  This book should be standard fare for all high school students, it holds so many proven techniques and practices. Make no mistake, this is an extraordinary book. Buy this book and/or have your local library get a copy ASAP!! 
 Great fun for the thinking person in love with cosmic horror. The Houellebecq part was shorter than I had anticipated.  The book comprises one 10 page Stephen King essay 'I have seen the history of horror, and his name is Lovecraft', one ten times longer Houellebecq manifesto (biographical/literary) on HPL and himself, two HPL stories (Call... and ...Whisperer...) which any HPL-loving person will already have read, and a fascinating translator's note in which Houellebecq's powers of imagination are further revealed 
 This collection brings together three remarkable novellas by Joseph Conrad: Youth, Heart of Darkness and The End of the Tether. In Youth Charlie Marlow recounts the troublesome voyage of the old ship Judea and its wretched 600-ton cargo of coal. The same Marlow also serves as the narrator in Heart of Darkness, undoubtedly the most famous of the three stories. It details how Marlow takes on a foreign assignment as a ferry boat captain on the Congo River in order to restore communications with Kurtz, an eccentric ivory procurement agent isolated in the secluded midlands. Finally in The End of the Tether Captain Whalley, a former dare-devil skipper, sacrifices his retirement and embarks on a precarious voyage on the steamer Sofala in order to support his distant, beloved daughter.   Like many of Conrad's early novels these three stories are set aboard ships. These stories tell of men who go beyond the normal routine of life to challenge themselves, whether from curiosity or necessity, in order to obtain what they seemingly cannot reach. Conrad depicts these desperate men with a vigor that on its own is already enough reason to dive in these stories. But there is much more. The real power of these masterpieces will only surface after a second read. The first reading is like a voyage into the unknown, not unlike the main characters would have experienced it. Only on a second or third reading do you become more aware of the subliminal power of the words and can you appreciate the full power of the colorful narrative. This way the at first read overly long descriptive passages get more and more significance and surely reveal their significance to the story.  One of the many layers to the stories is the drive to react against the self-proclaimed dominance of the human race: both against his environment as against his fellow man. In Heart of Darkness Marlow even literally proclaims that the unbounded exploitation of the natural resources is a disfigurement to the human conscience. Therefore it is not surprising that theme of alienation was craftily interwoven in John Milius' script for Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now loosely based upon Conrad's novella.  Not everyone will be charmed by the dense narrative and slow pace of these stories. But if you manage to see beyond this dated style, what is left is simply a masterpiece 
 In profile Michelle Pfeiffer, hugging her little son (Alex D. Linz, cute as a button but obnoxious and dramatically insecure), holds her head to the ceiling and all at once it looks like she's all chin, a chin so sharp it could wound a man.  Luckily the boy actor was spared, although he certainly hasn't been seen much lately.  I guess he had a vogue six or seven years ago but, his astonishing self-absorption on screen foretold a history of audiences growing tired of him.  Watching little Alex is like watching a glob of mercury harden into a mirror, while Michelle Pfeiffer who, for all I know may be equally narcissistic in real life, seems always to be sentient of every living thing--even the props--with which she interacts; I think people in the movie theater view this "noticing" quality as respect, and in turn we like her because of that.  Her beauty is sort of freakish, and Hollywood plays with that freakishness as they did with Garbo, and thus Pfeiffer plays Catwoman on the one hand, and on the other, the driven career woman who doesn't care about love or men--the Faye Dunaway part--as she does here in ONE FINE DAY, where all she cares about is her job in the architectural firm, and carrying that balsawood maquette up from the shop into her boss's office.  Meanwhile little Alex (Sammy) is radio-controlling little cars across the carpet of the office suite.  You see the model car speeding towards Melanie's high heels--then you see her face, radiant and obsessed, in the soft glow of the balsa office park.  A catastrophe is going to happen, and then it does.  Our beautiful untouchable goddess is laid low, pretty much what the audience has been yearning to happen since the opening credits.  Alex Linz looks on, gleefully, the horrid twerp.  
 This is a great one handed pepper grinder with a simple and effective design. The only drawback is that the size of the grind can't be adjusted 
 Naughty Girl by Carrie Alexander is a wonderful display of Carrie's writing abilties.  She has done a wonderful job of taking two real people and making a love story to remember.  Have Mercy by Susan Donovan is a great story about the wild outdoors and why sometimes it pays for us city gals to check out the scenery there. Reno's Chance by Lora Leigh is another masterpeice by this author.  If you haven't read her ebooks then you should.  This is by far my favorite story in the anthology.  She takes a hot yummy navy seal who must convice the love of his life to take a chance on them. 
 What Weber's ideas most clearly demonstrate is not capitalism as it is seen by the the devout protestant or any derivation thereof, he clearly proposes that capitalism itself is founded and practiced solely on the moral and ethical teachings of the protestant refromation. Furthurmore, the continued presence of God or any other religious influence is secondary to the overall implications of their socio-political indoctronation. Weber essentially argues, that it is protestantism's continued comitment to a vocational calling as compared to traditional catholic virtue of church commitment, that is the essential method of spiritual distinguishemnt.  It is aided by the virtualy simultanious growth of both capitalism and Protestantism that enabled capitalism to extend beyond simply a seclar practise and over-all "necissary evil," into a fully encompassing and consuming reflection of an individual's spiritual right of passage.  Evidence of Weber's theory is distributed widely through contemporary polotics, fully 20 of the top 30 industrailized nations are predominantly protestant. Even countries such as Japan that seemingly have had no protestant influence and have had success with a capitalist economy, inevitably, must submit themselves to Weber's theory because, Weber is not concerned pervasiveness protestant traditions, only with the occurence of protestant ideals. This book, though highly debated and controversial, is a must read for anyone with the slightest interest in global context or concerned with capitalism metioric rise to power. With a growing Globalized capitalist system, Webers ideas undoubtedly will become increasingly more apperent as capitalism invades every nook and cranny of an increasingly shrinking world; will cultures with otherwise foreign or dissimilar beliefs and practices every really be able to accept the merits of capitalism if they must equally reconcile themselves with the ethical premises of protestantism 
 There's a lot I like about "Bicentennial Man", like the computer animation of the futuristic cities and the change in Robin Williams' robot character. There's a bit that annoys me about it though, a couple of the concepts related to the ending and the ending itself. Bit frustrating, I thought 
 I bought Disgaea when it first came out and thought it was great.  Fun, funny, and with many long hours of game play.  When 2 came out, I was excited.  It didnt let me down.   Many features were improved from the first game.  The assembly is much more wieldy now.  The item world is more controlled.  And the battle are more challenging.  They also removed the ridiculous overpowered character aka angels and majiin that took forever to unlock and only obssesed players get em 
 American Car Design Now is the benchmark book in car design as business management, as sculpture and as  psychology.  It lays a foundation and sets a standard for intelligent writing on car design, writing that trains your eye to see more. The book is built on interviews with key designers and design managers at Ford, Chrysler and General Motors.  In three major sections it reveals and explores how managers make decisions about the broad concepts and how basics such as proportion and line, as well as defining details make or break the visual success of a design.  The author coaxes inarticulate designers to reveal how they work, how the mind, the eye and the hand create car designs that thrill or bore us. Visual concepts in the mind of the author reveal things that would go unnoticed by designer and observers unequipped with these concepts. Visual analyses of the designs of specific cars show how and why many great car design concepts become dull blobs when translated into production cars.  Analyses refer to photos illustrating the author' points.  A rich set of interviews with significant car designers is appended. Finally there is a fundamental glossary of car design terms that is a must-have.      Car-design is a complex intersect of art, business and psychology that this book captures but does not simplify.  You will earn what you learn from this book, but your effort will be rewarded.  My only complaint that this book's handsome graphic design often does not track the text closely enough.  Some photo references are incorrect, missing or distant from their discussion.  Nevermind that: this book is essential reading for anyone involved in car design. Buy it now; get express shipping; take time off to read it.  
 This book can be read over a hundred times!  There is always something new turn learn from it.  A book for everyone seeking peace and thoughtfulness 
 Having missed this mini-series when it was first aired on television in 1979, I searched for years for a VHS or DVD version without success.  Finally, I was able to purchase a poor-quality copy in 2003 from a private owner who had recorded it on his VCR at the time of its original television broadcast.  Because of technical distortions stemming from amateurish recording techniques, however, much of the sound and some of the visual components of the production were diminished.  As such, I was thrilled to discover that a DVD set had been recently produced and released.  Now, more than two decades later, I finally can enjoy this wonderful mini-series at its technical best; and, with its fine cast and excellent story development, it was well worth the wait 
 Franken nails it again.  Al reading his own material is priceless.  You wonder how the bad guys keep getting away with things.  Should be mandatory reading. 
 "The result is not an argument but a harangue," Inklings biographer Humphrey Carpenter avers in his book "The Inklings." (222)  Perhaps my four-star rating is the first clue that I disagree with the eminent British biographer's assessment of Lewis' "Abolition of Man."    It wasn't until my second reading that the book really took hold and the light of its conclusions became apparent.  In a scant three chapters (81 pages) Lewis has accomplished quite a bit.  To be fair to Mr. Carpenter's assessment, Lewis' entry into the discussion of morality does begin with a few remarks from a boys' grammar text.  To the average onlooker, the meditations that follow may look like a soapbox, but this is far from true.    By way of illustration, imagine that you go to the dentist and in the process of cleaning your teeth he pokes that little metal toothpick into a crack in one of your molars.  The twinge of pain nearly blacks you out the first time this happens, and to be sure the crack is what he thought it was he probes it again.  No doubt about it.  In surmising that this is actually an open cavity, he gives you all of the gory details on what open cavities look like, and the entire experience is colored by the initial stab of pain you felt upon your dentist's discovery of the problem.  I submit to you that this is what "The Abolition of Man" is like to those who read it.  Lewis has tapped a nerve in modern society, our tendency to make moral vice and virtue a matter of subjective taste, and having probed a few instances of this assumption, offered a lengthy discourse on the dangers of such moral relativism.  For many the result is a new crown that allows them to chew the food of culture more adeptly.  For others, all that remains of the experience when the final page is read is the pain with no solution, and their reaction is seen in negative remarks.    "Either you love it or you hate it," the cliche goes.  And it's true.  To accept Lewis' conclusion is to accept the possibility that the conspiracy theorists may be closer to the truth than we'd like to believe.  To deny it is to resign oneself to the ostrich approach, burying one's head in the sand of naivete.    For a more powerful reading of this book, I would recommend reading it with a group, one chapter per week, and undertaking a group viewing of M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village" on the fourth week.

 Very good book, full of statistics & good ideas on how to communicate with the younger generation 
 While the Tao Te Ching is considered to be the foundation work of Taoism, I find the Chuang Tsu to be much more accessible. At over 2000 years old, this book addresses the human condition in a way that holds meaning even today.  It is filled with tales that entertain on the surface while lodging deeply into your consciousness to chip away at your cultural conditioning.  Save yourself a trip across the world looking for a guru . . . buy this book instead and take it along for a hike in natural surroundings.  When you settle down in a comfortable spot, read the Chuang Tsu and see if it doesn't speak to you 
 Bought these binoculars for my husband. He loves them. They are very powerful and he loves the way they feel - not too heavy. He can look at stuff across the creek and is amazed at the clarity in the things that he sees 
 I am sure that I have never read a book that so accurately describes the life of the Roman Gladiators, and the bloodiness of the ring.  This book is certainly the most graphic of all the books I've read in this series.  We see the life of the gladiators and the sport in the ring right from the "front row seats".  This story tells about Falco's work for the emporer in the census.  He has partnered up with an old enemy of his -Anacrites.  We get to know Anacrites quite well, and he is an appealing character.  While Falco and his partner are doing the census work a lion of one of the men that they are auditing gets killed.  This sets Falco out to disover the netherworld of the animal owners, and he and Helena end up making a trip to Africa while pursuing the mystery.  The final pages in the book are "edge of your seat" type pages, and this is where things get really bloody.  (Two people close to Falco end up in the ring in two different parts of the program).  You will have to read to find out what happnes.  Good Stuff 
 ....which might not be saying a lot, if you've never liked Britney Spears or the pre-packaged pop she became known for. But I'll bet a decent number of you put down cash for one or two of her cds five or six years ago, for the simple reasons that her songs were catchy as hell and she looked good in those tight costumes she wore. Well the songs certainly didn't have any staying power, but the videos sure do. We have twenty(!) videos here, covering everything from "baby one more time" to "toxic" and "everytime." Pretty much everything you remember from mtv is on here, including a few lesser-known ones that didn't make mass release in North America. It's a pretty complete collection by any standard, and there's also tons of bonus clips included, for a running time of over 2.5 hours. That's a lot of Britney.  Production values were always Britney's strong points, and these videos are where she shines. I haven't been a Britney fan in years, but I find this disc a nice time capsule of a very brief and sugary period in music. If you want any one item to remind yourself why you ever thought Britney was cool, this dvd would be it. 
 this cd is amazing; nothing more needs to be said. but for those of you that need convincing: the songs are addicting and glorious. i can't get these songs out of my head-and i don't want to. it takes six people to make music this powerful. if you are even considering buying this do yourself a favor and get it; it is worth every penny 
 I bought this CD when I was 4 months pregnant with my first baby, Irene. From that time on, every single day, I would religiously listen to the music and let my baby listen to it, too(through earphones taped to my tummy.) Now that Irene is 4 months old, we both still listen to it frequently, and her response to the music is as if she knows the songs by heart! I believe it has also made my child more attentive and intelligent as a baby, even as a newborn. I love this CD, and will treasure it as one best purchases I made for my daughter and for myself 
 I'm giving this book four stars because it does do as it says; there are 1001 ways to be romantic. This may be just what you are looking for, a list. If you enjoy getting your information this way, this is the book for you.   The reason I didn't give it five stars; some of the items are replayed over with minor changes. Some of it just seems to be filler to reach the 1001 goal. If you are not looking for a big list, this book is probably not for you. Although, if you are a collector of romantic idea books, it's a must have for your collection. 
 My mother read Dr. Spock, as did I when I had my kids. He was not permissive and did not advise us to raise impolite poorly behaved children.  Fortunately this book manages to convey this. Dr. Spock's legacy has been  maligned and cheapened by ignorant people, most of whom never read the good  Doctor. This book presents a full picture of the man in his weakness and  strength. I think Spock would have been content to stand on the record.  This book is long overdue. Thank you to Thomas Maier and thank you to Dr.  Spock 
 Like many other long term hobby digital photo fans I have used Paint Shop Pro for more than 10 years from version 4. It has always been a frustration that the programme was written for creating paint type graphics and photos were almost an add on. As Digital photography became more and more a real option the earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro became more of a frustration and I tried everything else. At last Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo feels like it was written for photo editing. It is easy to use with all the assistance a beginner could want, but dig deeper and it will go wherever you want to go, and more. I'm sad to see Paint Shop Album almost redundant, but it is great to have the organiser on tap. It runs on a less than optimal computer system unlike others that are too large and slow for many of us to consider. 
 Well, this CD isn't NEARLY as good as I expected it to be, but it's a start! Aly and AJ are both very talented girls with great voices. I didn't even know that they were sisters until I bought this! I was pretty surprised, I thought they were just best friends or something. Anyway, their music isn't exactly what you'd call "pop" which is what I like best, but it's still very good! Here's what I think about each song:  1. Rush - 10/10 An AWESOME first single and an excellent beginning! This song starts out a little quietly, and then when the chorus comes it get's so much louder! I love that part!  2. No one - 7/10 Not too good, it's too slow, but I do like the lyrics.  3. Collapsed - 10/10 WOW! I love this one! The tune in the chorus is just great, and the lyrics are well-written! This is definitely a song that you would like to dance to or sing along to.  4. Something more - 10/10 Another great one! The tune is very familiar, it sounds like I've definitely heard it before.  5. On the ride - 9/10 This one is pretty good too! The lyrics are the best part though, they're very encouraging.  6. Speak for myself - 8/10 Um, I don't quite remember how the tune in this song goes exactly, I got this CD only a few days ago, but I'm sure I liked it a bit.  7. Out of the blue - 10/10 Another one of my favs! The tune is awesome, it's kind of a sad song but that's ok, I like sad songs a lot! I know the lyrics in them (and this song, of course) are a little depressing, but most of the time they're just so pretty!  8. In a second - 6/10 Another one of those slow, boring songs. I always skip this one, I've only listened to it once.  9. I am one of them - 10/10 Wow, I absolutely LOVE the beginning of this song! The chorus could be better though, and this is also a very sad song talking about kids getting killed and kidnapped in car accidents and things like that. But other than that, this song has a beautiful tune! Oh, and I love the ending as well!  10. Sticks and stones - 8/10 This is alright, the lyrics are very true of course, but the tune could've been better.  11. Protecting me - 8/10 This one is alright as well, the lyrics are well-written, and the verses are great, but I would like it better if the chorus was a little different.  12. Slow down - 10/10 Another great one! I just love the tune and the lyrics!  13. Do you believe in magic - 10/10 Ok, I don't know why I don't listen to this one much, but I really like it! It's got the best kind of beat that fits the lyrics in this song.  14. Walking on sunshine - 10/10 Ah, so cool! A great new and better remake of the old 70s version of this! I've heard one other remake of this song as well by jump5, and I've heard the original version of course, but of the 3 of those I think I like this one the best!   Overall, good CD. I definitely recomend it for all. I can't wait for their next record! 
 An awesome history lesson, especially for those who have forgotten what it takes to defeat evil in the world. I hesitantly started reading this book expecting some blowhard general to gloat about his limited accomplishments in the big war. I had a very pleasant surprise and was drawn into another perspective of what we did as a nation to defeat Hitler and his cronies. The title is taken from a line in the Cadet's Prayer from West Point. It is a prayer we all could use to recite occasionally. I very highly recommend this book 
 This is Colonel Podhajsky's story of his life, told in context of his relationships with his horses.  Sometimes people tend to think that some of the currently popular "natural horsemandship" principles are either new, or apply only to western riding.  However, Colonel Podhajsky talks in terms of true partnership and understanding with your horse from the perspective of classical European Dressage, and of course pre-dates the current popular "methods."  Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Pat and Linda Parelli, and feel that they, and others who are popular today, have done a lot to improve the lot of horses.  They have also found a way to help the rest of us learn how to achieve the sort of relationships with our horses that Colonel Podhajsky describes in this book.  This book is the story of a true master in every sense of the word.  Don't miss it! 
 This should be a movie- what a great, great, story! If you love baseball, friendship, and a good read- this is a must own. Its a very quick read, and it leaves you with great feelings. Awesome Book 
 Before I bought this book I did not realize that it is such a very useful resource. If you are looking for a resource to inspire your startegic leadership, it is the right one.  I really like to have more books from CCL :-) 
 This soundtrack has wonderful sound quality and includes all of the compositions I remember from the movie. The instrumentals are gorgeous. A must-have for any fan of the movie 
 I purchased this book because most of my property is covered with mature trees, and I had a very hard time getting anything to grow.   While building a patio/garden, this book proved invaluable many times.  I bought it several years ago and still use it every Spring 
 I finished reading "Vital Friends." This is a great book and very easy to read. It is only 152 pages if you exclude the appendices. So, it can be finished in a few sittings.  Here are some of the books findings:  *People who have friend(s) at work are significantly less likely to quit. *They are also happier *Have less health problems  The book recommends that companies enourage on the job friendships and not to totally seperate one's social life from ones work life.  The Book then talks about the different types of friends and the different roles they play in helping ones well being and career at work.  Finally, the book talks about how to grow these friendships and making them stronger.  I have the hard cover edition, which I got as a gift from my cousin. If you are not happy with work, one of the reasons could be the fact you have no best friends at work. If this is the case, go ahead and buy the hard cover edition. Otherwise, you can wait until the soft cover or paper back version is out. Eben for those of us who are happy with their work and friendships this book offers some good information and would help you better understand your friendships 
 Dedicated to Hitchcock, whom Truffaut admired so much, it tells us the sordid revenge of a suddenly when leaving behind the church minutes ago, his husband is shot by three men. He will assume the role of Fair Agent even she has to be in jail in order to come to the last act. Jeanne Moreau as always was magnificent and the rest of the cast too.  
 Harriet the Spy is about a girl named Harriet, who likes to take notes on everyone and also likes to spy. One day, the kids in her class get a hold of the notebook that she writes in and they read all the notes in it. I really liked the beginning when Harriet is spying, but the book peters off. 
 Paladin of Souls by Lois McMaster Bujold is the second book in her Chalion series. It won the Hugo award for best novel in 2004. While I enjoyed the book, I think there were probably some better choices out there.  The story takes up where the Curse of Chalion left off. If you havent read the first book and don't want to be spoiled skip to the end of the review.  The curse of the golden general has been lifted, and Caz and Iselle have settled in to their new roles as Queen and Chancelor. For Dowager Royina Ista though, things have changed. With the curse lifted so has her madness, or so she hopes. In order to gain some freedom she sets off on a pilgrimage with some old friends and some new.  Along her journey she discovers that there are demons loose in the land. Not only that but there are new tensions along the border of Jokarna. More troubling yet, are her dreams. Is her madness truly gone?  The book clocks in at just under 500 pages. It probably could have been been shrunk to two thirds that side without much trouble. I felt there was too much exposition, and that too much of it was repeated. I read the first book. I know the story of Lord dy Lutez. I can deal with hearing it retold once, but two or three times, is too much. There wasnt anything groundbreaking in this book, but it was still a good story worth the read.  7 out of 10 
 The delivery was timely and the book was in an excellent shrink wrapped, brand new condition 
 It seems that the number of books put out by publishers, in any number of fields, will not be abetting anytime soon. Whether or not that is a good thing may be a matter of debate. Some subjects are worth discussing at length, because trawling for deeper meanings or drawing out the nuances of the matter yield more insight and expand our understanding with each new layer of data-whether by contrasting it against the hard edge of another discipline or by the overlay of the veneer of a new metaphor. But some subjects, once having been examined, leave one with the impression that "everything that needs to be said has been said."   	Robert Banks and Bernice M. Ledbetter think that the subject of leadership is one of those topics worth revisiting, and they do so in their book, Reviewing Leadership, much to our benefit. In this short book, Banks and Ledbetter do two things. First, they briefly introduce the reader to "everything that needs to be said that has been said" about leadership by providing a brief overview of how leadership has been treated and understood in what they categorize as biblical, historical, and contemporary perspectives (chapter two). Second, in the chapters following, they attempt to bring an ethical lens to the subject of leadership through a Christian perspective, beginning with "spiritual and religious dimensions" (chapter three) to a more overt Christian understanding of the leadership function in the final chapter through the use of "exemplary case studies" of Christian leadership in action (refreshingly, and tellingly, none of the persons featured in the case studies would likely be the first, or second, guess of most contemporary leaders or informed laity as to "models of leadership.").  	According to the writers, the book is "a summary of academic approaches and concrete experiences. It is a fruit of biblical investigation and reflection on our own experiences. It is an exercise in cultural analysis and theological exploration. It is derived from current writings on leadership and personal observations of exemplary role models. It has its basis in common sense and familiar proverbs and our exposure to film and poetry" (p. 11). And it is this confessed subjectivity that yields some of the (few) least helpful portions and conclusion in the book. The critical reader, however, will be able to overcome those sections and focus on some of the more substantive and insightful contributions the authors make in this study.  	The first two chapters provide a background to the study on leadership that the authors develop. The first chapter provides definitions and discussions on the nature of leadership and stakes a claim as to the importance of its study. In the second chapter the authors offer a brief historical interpretive overview of leadership, limiting the scope to a biblical context and to the last century. The brevity of the coverage leaves curious gaps in the scope of leadership studies, as well as an absence of mention of some arguably influential leadership theories and schools.  	Chapters three and four provide the unique contribution that the book makes to the subject at hand. In these chapters the authors attempt to highlight overt spiritual, theological, and religious dimensions of leadership. The treatment culminates in their attempt to frame, and critique, distinctly "Christian" approaches to leadership.  The fifth chapter discusses how to translate theories of leadership into practice through the advocacy of three ethical (Christian) dimensions: faithfulness, integrity, and a servant-like attitude. Following the chapter on case studies of model leaders (Franck Buchman, Soren Kierkegaard, Janet Hagberg, and Gordon Cosby), the book concludes with a a very brief chapter reflecting on how to nurture the kind of Christian leadership the authors advocate.  	While not containing everything that needs to be said on the subject of leadership, this book is a good companion addition to other solid, more thorough, books on leadership that may be on the readers' bookshelf.  
 My grandparents bought me this for Christmas and I really love it! The doll is absolutely breathtaking, and she has honey blond hair with golden highlights. Her eyes are a deep blue green color, and she is very pretty overall. The closet she comes with is very cute, and I can put Barbie shirts and skirts on the little hangers! There is a lot of room for shoes and purses and hair accessories, I love this toy 
 Quite a nice little book.  On rereading I rated it higher than the first time.  
 King did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one.  There were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing.  For the most part, not bad.  Would make a good movie 
 Tom Friedman has a regular column in the new york times. I have always loved his columns and this book is excellent (It is actually a collection of his NY Times columns). A must read for anyone who is interested in politics in the middle east, terrorism and its origin and the iraq war 
 There are some writers who are able to capture the essence of an artist through the interview format (James Lord's sitting for Giocometti is one) and in this book David Sylvester plumbs the depths of Francis Bacon's psyche like no other writer to date.  Not only is his short book brilliantly executed in drawing out the artistic temperament and the especial qualities that chewed every aspect of Bacon's rich brain, it also allows us to sit back and hear the very personal aspects of Bacon's life, aspects that are occult in his cryptic paintings.  This is reportage at its zenith.  The big difference here is that Sylvester writes so well that the atmosphere is palpable - as though we were the fly on the wall.  Brilliant, just brilliant 
 In this new set of interviews, America's foremost intellectual activist looks at new questions of US domestic and foreign policy.  In September 2002, the American government announced a new national security strategy. Instead of pre-emptive war, which might be covered by the UN Charter, the new strategy will be one of preventive war, which is not permitted at all under international law. In other words, America will rule the world by force, and if any challenge to that domination comes about, whether imagined, invented or perceived in the distance, America has the right to destroy that challenge before it becomes a threat.  The Bush Administration talks about going after countries that harbor terrorists. Orlando Bosch, described by the Justice Department as a threat to American security, is quietly living in Miami, recipient of a Presidential Pardon. In 1976, Bosch was involved in the shooting down of a Cuban airliner, killing 73 people, among other crimes. Emanuel Constant is responsible for the deaths of at least 4000 Haitians. He is living in Queens, New York, because America refuses to even respond to extradition requests, let alone actually say No. Such doctrines are unilateral; they grant America the right to harbor terrorists and use violence, but not anyone else.  The people around George Bush are very open about their desire to destroy the progressive achievements of the last 100 years. They have generally gotten rid of the progressive income tax. They are next going after Social Security and health care. They do not want a small government. They are interested in a huge, massively intrusive government, but one that works for them.  This is another excellent and eye-opening book from Chomsky and Barsamian. For another very interesting look at the way America and the world Really Works, this is highly recommended.  
 It is fitting that this book is not written in "perfect", smooth flowing format - because this is an accounting of a man who was swept up in excess and excitement without giving himself the time to truly "know himself", and thus his life did not unravel in "perfect" smooth flowing format.  This is a great book because it relates what hundreds of thousands of people have experienced in the latter 21st century, only it does so in an exagerated and romantic way: an unrelenting climb and push to business success that moved so rapidly and excitedly that spiritual self-fulfillment was often remiss.  This is an honest and direct chronicle of a very "hip" life.  And now, at last, Yetnikoff is attempting to come to terms with himself, and - to his credit - with no lack of humour and a respectable but not overly synthetic underlying amount of remorse. You may not agree with his excesses and some of the decisions he has made in his life, but you have to admire the journey.  The tidbits of info on the major music personalities emphasize the fact that no matter how famous (or infamous) people become - they share many of the same problems, needs, and desires we all have. Thanks, Walter - you produced a good, entertaining and honest read 
 I read this book with some skepticism at first since the initial reviews from the pundits were lukewarm. But I must admit, it is a riveting account of late 20th century American politics, and what it takes to rise to the top. Clinton's narration comes across in a natural, easygoing style, and it surprised me how deeply he thinks and feels about things that really matter. Those looking for juicy tidbits and meaningless chatter will be disappointed. This is a serious account by Clinton, about his strengths, weaknesses, and most importantly, his capacity to forgive his enemies. His early childhood experiences, especially what he learnt from his grandfather, seem to have made a major positive impact in his life. This, and how non-racist his folks were even though they poor, southern folks from the 1920s era, armed him with that all-important Teflon coating needed in politics.   Clinton's capacity to forgive is exceeded only by the public's willingness to forgive him. In his glaring personal weaknesses they recognized their own follies, and in his ability to overcome, they saw their inner hero. Clinton, in many respects, was a naked president. This nakedness comes across even in the narration, endearing readers to him and to see in his vulnerabilities an innocent and instant capacity for change. A second or third reading (if you have the time/patience!) brings out more of Clinton's emotional and political entrails. Some trends emerge. For example, Clinton would dream big, would start strong, win, self-sabotage, rally again, win big this time. No doubt this comes from his personality to seek adventure and to relish the pleasure of an impossible comeback. One of Clinton's stated dreams was to write a great book. This book too, has embarked on a similar journey. It started with great fanfare, bestseller, fizzled in the ratings, now beginning to rally. The years pass, I see even his ardent detractors mellowing.....it is possible that this book will finish the journey....it will rally, and win big. In all seriousness, this is an excellent read 
 If there ever was a book that teaches you how to be a scholar in 600 pages or less, this is it. Very clearly written. And Barzun has proven many times that he has a fine mind and good judgement. Hence this book violates the  witticism "Those who can't do, teach." Every serious university  student of humanities or social theory should read this book carefully 
 LAURENCE BERGREEN has done a terrific job in all departments. When you finish the book, you have a good idea of who IRVING BERLIN was, and what a life he had from singing waiter to AMERICAN's first great composer with JEROME KERN. Anyone interested in the story of AMERICAN music should read that book 
 Waiting for Guffman is an awesomely funny movie!  It's shot just like a low cost documentary would be shot - awkward transitions, bumbling soliloquies and strange zoom action.  The characters are wonderful.  Guest got everything just right from the travel agent wearing white athletic socks with his loafers to the over-exuberant Blaine Community Players.  The movie was full of slapstick humor along with witty, thoughtful humor as well.  What's great about this movie as well is that you're not just laughing at the characters, you're getting excited about the Blaine Sesquecentennial right along with them!  The songs are catchy (in a frighteningly annoying kind of way), and you find yourself tapping your foot along with the song and dance review.    If you have seen other Guest movies, I would say this one ranks in the middle for me (Best in Show is my favorite, Waiting for Guffman, then A Mighty Wind).  I think this one captured the excitement and hilarity of small-town pride and revelry.  Loved it!  Favorite line: "I hate you, you... bastard people...  You're all bastard people! 
 Huge S.U.Vs, hormonal-pregnant women, teen-age sons and rock music...nothing is safe from Dave Barry's sarcastic wit and humor.  Dave asserts that all the cool rock bands were the Rolling Stones and the Beach boys and the stuff his son listens to is garbage (he also asserts that his son listens to bands with names such as "Heave" and "Squatting Turnips").  This just goes to show you that Dave is old, but he doesn't mind making fun of the fact that he's old.  Dave appeals to the government, insisting that we declare war on Canada for reasons that escape me at the moment.  Oh, and by the way, I wouldn't drink that Luwak coffee if I were you 
 I used Lathi almost 20 years ago. His book was and continues to be the most didactic book on Communications Systems.  This book is a pleasure to read. It motivates each definition and theorem and is very well balanced.  It address analog and digital systems and introduces and emphasizes Fourier Transforms. The book contains also a good introduction to stochastic processes. 
 The premise of "It's All in Your Head" is that we already have everything we need to be happy, because the "secrets"/tools are already in our "minds" - But we have to make a choice to shine a light on them again (remember them), and then get them out of our minds and into reality (use & experience them).  Stephen Pollan shares many great insights within the covers of this book - ones that can help us to remember what it takes to be happy - a feeling that many of us strive for day after day.  Some of these insights include:  1.  We are responsible for our own happiness or unhappiness -    so it makes absolutely no sense to blame our unhappiness on     others, or expect others to make us happy.  2.  Happiness is different from pleasure - external things can      bring us pleasure, but never happiness.  3.  People who are experiencing great lack & illness can still     be happy  4.  Happiness is an attitude that can be cultivated - but like      most things, it takes work.  5.  Taking the time to remember what you're grateful for each      day can have an amazing impact on your level of happiness  The author suggests 8 "tools" to remember & use while you're working to create an attitude of happiness, and he also includes many different journal exercises to help you out along the way.    I really enjoyed his use of personal stories to bring his thoughts/ideas/tools home - I think we can all find ourselves in at least one of these people &/or situations - which I find to be a another great way to solidify what I'm reading & learning.  Overall, I found this book to be an enjoyable, insightful, helpful read on the topic of happiness.  As such, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase their own level of happiness - it certainly has a lot to offer 
 Gerhart's explanations are clear and concise.  He has inspired me -- I'm ready to start at least 3 new home projects.  Just what I needed to get started 
 This book shines for anyone who wants a deeper understanding of how the Macintosh came to be. Everyone knows the basic story of how Apple based the Mac on the innovations of Xerox, but the real story is much deeper than that. Xerox PARC provided the innovation and spark, but there was a lot more blood and guts work that followed, especially considering the state of computer technology at the time. While there is of course a lot about Steve Jobs, equal attention is given to the various engineers who did nuts and bolts software and hardware development. Those looking for corporate intrigue and board room warfare could probably find better accounts elsewhere, although these are also covered here (as they inevitably had an effect on the Mac's development over the years.)  Given how commonplace the GUI and its various metaphors (folders and files, desktop, trash can, etc.) are today, it's easy to lose sight that the original Mac (and Lisa) team were really venturing way off into the unknown.  This book is a great read for anyone or any company trying to do the same 
 This is by far the best volume in the 1-5 set!  It deals with themes of Artificial Life and a twist on the origins of man!  "Long Distance Call" -- a chilling episode about a little boy and his dying grandmother. [**]  "I Sing the Body Electric" -- an robotic nanny is built to take care of some children.  They grow attached to her... [**1/2]  "The Lonely"   -- Perhaps the best TZ episode ever?  A prisoner on a lifeless planet is given a robot companion.  He is at first reluctant to buy into this illusion, but this illusion becomes his reality... [*****]  "Probe 7, Over and Out"  -- Great episode written by Sterling about a man who crashes his spaceship on a (seemingly) uninhabited planet.  He later discovers his home planet destroys itself in a nuclear war...  Fantastic suprise ending!  [****]   ---  If you're only passively interested in the TZ, this should be one of the first DVD volumes that you buy!  It contains some truly exceptional episodes 
 I run two websites using this program, easy learning curve, I recommend it to all my newbie friends that need a simple, workable program. Ignore the crittics, this is a nice program.Only wish in batch editing I could do multiple web page saves. 
 Once I listened through a few of the songs, I was completely hooked to HIL. I've always been a rock fan, but will really listen to anything that floats my boat, which HIL most definately does. I love the way the singer can switch from melody to metal, then back again like he it was nothing. The music is constantly switching, but not in a way that distracts you from the rest of the song, it only adds to the experience. Definately recomend this for at least a listen through 
 The National Treasure soundtrack is one of my favorites. It's up-beat, and fast-paced, and very energetic. It has an interesting mix of orchestral, techno, and rock music - put together in a very creative way. It doesn't have many of those moments of miscillaneous chords wandering around everywhere like alot of soundtracks I've heard do. The only thing is that there are only a few themes and they are repeated a lot. So, listening to it TO much may get you tired of those themes pretty quickly. Other than that, I've REALLY enjoyed listening to it - and I highly reccommend it 
 A superb job of telling a complex story, A Sense of Place is a screenplay waiting to happen.  The author, a skilled storyteller, takes the reader through 100 years of winery history, from Niebaum, the creator, to Coppola,  the preserver.  Along the way, there is a full cast of bunglers, buffoons  and heros.  For those who know nothing about wine, it will be an  enlightening story.  For those who do, a compelling one--the verbal  equivalent of a case of 1995 Rubicon 
 This is quite simply the best short comprehensive history of the Civil War available, and has been since it was first published 20 years ago. It was the best short history of anything since Gibbon, and nothing has really rivalled it since.  McPherson places battles, people and politics in a definitive context that strikes the reader as being as close as any human can come to having a "true" understanding of that War.  It is EXTREMELY well written as well, and set the stage for the Ambroses and McCulloughs who followed through and popularized scholarly history 
 'Beginning Postcolonialism' is designed to help new readers in the field of postcolonial literature and theory make initial progress, although more seasoned readers will also, I hope, find the book of interest. It offers a  brief historical account of the emergence of the field, and focuses on some  important issues which concern postcolonialism: colonial discourses,  nationalism and its critique, re-reading/re-writing the texts of Empire,  postcolonialism and feminism, diaspora identities. It concludes with a  survey of some of the problematic aspects of theorising postcolonialism,  and offers a select but extensive bibliography for further reference.  Several of the key thinkers in the field -- Fanon, Senghor, Bhabha, Said,  Spivak, Mohanty, Gilroy -- are examined, and each chapter concludes by  looking at how we might read literary texts in the light of postcolonial  theory (my  examples here include Rudyard Kipling, Ngugi wa Thiong'o,  Chinua Achebe, Jean Rhys and Sally Morgan). Throughout the book I have  inserted 'Stop and Think' sections which invite readers to make up their  own minds concerning the issues we raise. If you have read the book, I  would be really interested to learn of your comments (please feel free to  e-mail me at mcleod@english.novell.leeds.ac.uk). Naturally I give it five  stars, but you may have a different view!  Hopefully, 'Beginning  Postcolonialism' will be a great place to start your reading in the area,  as well as a good reference tool for future use 
 I thought this book was a lot of fun, and very informative. We should all be so lucky as to travel the world, and no less, in 80 days but to do it in the past with much difficulty is something else.  The one thing I found confusing was that the author tended to skip arond in their storytelling, but still highly recommended to kids and adult 
 I'm a new working mom with a ten-month-old daughter!  I have been searching for resources to support my decision and all I'd found has been stay-at-home mom information!  This book is a godsend!  Although alot of it has to do with school-age children, which I know I can use for years to come, it has given me tips and ideas to use immediately as well as reassuring me that I can do it all and have my kids turn out ok!  I'd rather be home, but for those of us who can't be, this is a the book to read 
 Those looking for a high level introduction to building applications on networked processors need look no further. This book is an excellent introduction to the core concepts and drills down into the processor level mechanics.   This book is highly architectural in nature. The code is primarily pseudo code (with some C and Assembler) and there are illustrations showing logic flow and the structure of the various example processors. There is some drill down into the construction of some specific processors: StrongARM, IXP, Microegines, among others. But overall you should consider the work an architectural piece which serves as an introduction to a fast moving field.  Comer is known for bringing simplicity to complex topics and he does not fail here. The text is easy to read and follow and the illustrations that accompany the explanations are effective. This is an ideal introduction for those that are new to network processors 
 The haikus in this book are excellent. They match beautifully with the illustrations. What a great way to introduce haiku to a young person (and an older person!)  My only disappointment is the interspersing of Issa's life into the work. It would have been better to have it as an author note at the end. The "story" part of Issa, I think, makes it difficult to give this as a gift or to share with children unless you are prepared to start addressing fears of mommy dieing when you (child) are three, having a mean stepmother that yells at you, etc. 
 Johnny Angel is a wonderful and inspirational book. Johnny Angel is one of my favorite books, it tells you to keep going even through the tough times. This book is about a boy named Johnny that was in a car accident after his senior prom. He was in the car with his perfect girlfriend, and two of her friends, Johnny was bringing them home. When all of a sudden, another car came out of nowhere and hit Johnny's side of the car. Everyone in the car was injured, but Johnny was the only one that was pronounced dead. Everyone was very sad about Johnny's death. When one day his mother got deathly ill and was in the hospital. His mother would have dreams that she was in a room and was talking to her son. She didn't ever want to leave her dreams.But one night when they were talking and he said that the next time she would see him is when she woke up. Of course she didn't believe him so she tried to stay in her dream, but he forced her to wake up. But when she woke up, there he was, sitting at the end of her bed. It just so happens that Johnny had some unfinished buisness that had brought him back as an angel. We find out that only his mother, and later in the book his little mute brother could see him. Througout this book Johnny is helping everyone get through the tough times to move onto better things. If you like to read inspirational books I highly reccomend reading Johnny Angel by Danielle Steel 
 Italian Renaisance art by Laurie Schneider Adams is a wonderful introductory text on Renaisance art.  It is very clearly written with a helpful glossary for those who are not familiar with art terms.  It not only explains both style and iconography of the Renaisance period but gives a great backround of the culture of the period.  The illustrations in the text are wonderfuly detailed and most are in color.  This is a great text for intro. classes to Ren. art and people who wish to learn on their own 
 This book HAD to be written for my daughter & me!!  My daughter had started reading it & was not even past the 2nd chapter when she was yelling, "MOM!! YOU JUST HAVE TO READ THIS!!" Ohmigod, It is DEAD ON our relationship. Unlike some books that before you finished it, would have you seeking professional help, this makes me feel WONDERFUL that we are obviously not the only ones with all these same feelings and interactions. How comforting in itself! I absolutely love this book so far & am looking forward to reading the rest of it. HIGHLY recommended :) Thanks for writing such a good one.  Beverly (& Jennifer) Armstron 
 This is the best-produced academic paperback I have ever seen. The book is wonderfully illustrated.  The photographs are supplemented by hundreds of intriguing drawings in the wide margins.  The text is spaciously presented and easy to read.  I found zero typographical errors in more than six hundred pages of text, a delight in these days of hasty editing.  Hillenbrand's writing is clear, straightforward, and balanced.  The book presents a much-needed new perspective on the Crusades.  Five stars 
 Thousand Foot Krutch has changed their sound from album to album, and I think this one sits best with me. The riffs are sweet, the bass lines are catchy, and the drums are anything but typical. And what to say about the vocals... simply put, this guy sings like no one else out there!  I love that they did not write anything on here that they hoped would be a single, perhaps with the exception of Rawkfist, which is my least favourite song on the CD. It just tries too hard to be catchy. That song aside, here's what I think of the rest of the album, song-by-song:  Phenomenon - Good opener... slowly builds from verse to chorus. A lot of rhyming makes it easy to remember! Step to Me - I love that the entire verse is bass, drums and vocals only. No crunching guitars until the chorus! Last Words - A song that was inspired by, and will likely impact, those who think about committing suicide. Great message! This is a Call - The only slow song on the CD, it touches the heart of today's adolescent mind. Uncertainty, insecurity, in search of something strong and true to hang onto. Faith, Love and Happiness - Another great rocker. Not the most original song, but still a great listen. I Climb - Written in a minor key, this one's a little on the somber side but very catchy! Quicken - My favourite song on the CD, perhaps. Great bass line. Awesome lyrics! "The way Your words connect my thoughts!" New Design - This song rocks! I love the whispering behind the actual vocals... adds a lot of depth to the song! Bounce - Originally released on X-2003, this one was redone (and improved, might I add) and fits in perfectly with this release. Ordinary - My favourite part is the "Laugh if that makes me ordinary!" just after the halfway point of the song. Break the Silence - Good end to the CD. The first couple minutes of the song are somewhat ordinary, but the last minute is sweet!  So there it is, folks. If you don't have this album yet, you're missing out. It is a fine work that can be enjoyed both by Christians (the lyrics hint strongly at the band's faith) and non-Christians (nothing preachy or corny to turn anyone off) alike 
 The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior takes you back to the beginning. A young girl ventured alone into the jungle and befriended a group of chimpanzees. What she saw became the stuff of scientific legend. But then, last year came a terrible tragedy. Frodo, one of the chimpanzees she had helped make famous, killed a human baby. That shocking act brought into focus a huge debate about the relationship between humans and chimps, and what these primates have taught us about the origins of our own behavior.   The saga of how Jane Goodall went into the jungle to study the chimps of Gombe in Tanzania has inspired novels and movies. Her observations revealed that chimpanzees were in many ways like humans. They used tools, had culture and even language. And what's more they had empathy. They were also capable of savage brutality against their own kind. Just like us.   In fact many began to think that the origins of aggressive human male behavior could be traced back to our shared evolutionary ancestry with chimps. In other words, men are genetically programmed to be violent. But then came some disturbing questions. The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior is in turns charming, disturbing and poignant, Jane Goodall explores the relationship between science and the chimpanzee 
 By using the telephone as a case study, Fischer examines the role of  technology as an instrument in modern life. The first chapter provides a  terrific overview of the academic literature on technology, though given  the time span covered by the book, it does not address the Internet. The  book is also unusual in that it actually relies on data when making claims  about the telephone and the world that emerged around it 
 I recently purchased Spectrum 9, 10, and 11. These books are absolutely wonderful, and I would recommend them to any artist or fan of fantasy/sci fi art. They are extremely well put together, of high quality (reproduction wise), have a large number and variety of artists, and contain some of the most beautiful works of art I have seen. Some of the subject matter can be disturbing or somewhat sexual in nature (certainly nothing explicit, but not exactly innocent either), so I wouldn't recomend them for the very young (12 or under?) if you are a parent. These books are worth every penny and highly recommended 
 When I saw these guys on some 'Ones to Watch' sort of thing on mtv, i was immediately entranced. They had a catchy song and I immediately found my way to Limewire and downloaded face down.  When the album came out...i bought it have been listening to it ever sense. Part of me just blends with the music and falls into this trance (I ran into a 2 x 4 listening to their cd.) where it's just me and the music. It's rare i do that with music. my thing is movies.  RJA isn't like any other band. They don't have just ordinary catchy tunes that you can bounce around to when you're alone in your room. It's real music, with well thought up lyrics. The band is talented, and on their mark. Don't You Fake It is seriously one of the greatest albums I've ever honed 
 Power is Classic Ice-T at it's best. The rhymes and beats may seem simplistic to some, but let's take it in context people. This was released in 1988. In those days gangsta rap was in it's infancy still. This is definitely an example of the best from that period. This album won't appeal to hardcore fans I suspect, but will for true Ice-T fans. Turn on, tune in and enjoy.  
 As an interior design student, I find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration, variety, and creativity.  This magazine is more about art and design than advice on "do it yourself" decorating or cheap furniture finds, so:  do NOT subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one-two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different, more practical purpose 
 When you hear or read about the Founding Fathers, the same names pop up time and again:  Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Hamilton and Madison.  In sports terms, this was the starting lineup for the Revolutionary Era.  You can't win, however, without a good bench, and among the 18th century second-stringers, John Jay was an important player.  What did Jay do?  For starters, he was the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and although he was not spectacular in the role, he did set a few precedents.  In addition, after leaving the post to become Governor of New York, he was re-offered the position by John Adams; when Jay declined resuming the post, Adams turned to John Marshall, who wound up being the most important Chief Justice of them all.  Jay also served as a President of the Continental Congress, so in a very limited way, he was the chief executive of the early United States.  He also participated in the treaty with Britain that ended the Revolution, served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs in the pre-Constitutional era, and was one of the authors of the Federalist papers.  Although not a delegate in the Constitutional Convention, he actively campaigned for ratification and did contribute a couple of big ideas to the document:  the Supremacy Clause (acknowledging treaties and the Constitution as the supreme law of the land) and the provision limited the Presidency to natural-born citizens (a topical item considering the drive by some who see Arnold Schwarzenegger as a possible President).  Walter Stahr's competent if unspectacular biography of Jay is quite readable and shines a light on this somewhat obscure political figure.  Stahr's main failing (and it is generally a minor one) is that his affection for his subject sometimes affects his objectivity, leading him to explain Jay's actions.  This is no hagiography, however, and Stahr does occasionally put Jay under a harsher light.  For most people, John Jay is like Gouverneur Morris, John Hancock or Patrick Henry:  a man who is more or less in the background of the stories of other figures without ever really being defined beyond a few scant details.  Stahr, however, shows that this particular second-stringer was a most important utility player.  Although the book is not perfect, it gets a full five stars for overall quality and the fact that it provides illumination on a generally neglected historical figure. 
 Both of my dogs found carrot to be their favorite flavor over cheese, bacon or any of the others.  Yeah carrot is best.  It was 2 different types of dogs too one pug and one shepheard mix.  This must taste really good and they must like the mild sweetness.  He also likes real carrots and pulp from the juicer.  Yeah carrot is that good.  I go easy on the carrot pulp from the juicer because it is so fibrous.  
 nicely mixed, every track sounds good and blends well with the others. this cd was on sale, and ended up being a really good deal 
 This is an okay game, though it sometimes gets a little boring.  This game can teach kids different words.  There are 8 categories to choose from, plus you can choose how many letters you want in the game.  You get 11 guesses to guess what word they are giving you 
 I loved Xenogears and when it was known that they were going to bring out xenosaga I was so looking forward to it. Well 1 didn't disapoint which led to 2.!! Then there was 2, well talk about a letdown. Then the talk of 3 started. At first I was unsure if I wanted to lay down any more money and be disapointed yet again... But WOW am I glad I did. It was a beauty to watch and play. Many of the answers from games 1 and 2 can be found it breath taking cut scenes. Im not going to spoil things for you but just to say WOW isnt enough to discribe the CGI's and twist and turns. I just hope you enjoy this game as much as I have 
 This book is not fiction. The author researches REAL facts and sightings, and concludes that the saucers are interplanetary. Donald Keyhoe made a serious recearch, from an "inside" perspective , having some access to original military files. Before he started the research, he would not believe in the "visitors from space" answer. But checking thoroughly every other possible answer, he saw that they didn't fit in the sightings and the reports.  This book is a *must* have to anyone who wants to know the truth about the UFO phenomenon. It contains everything, from the reports and reactions to the military cover up. The *visitors* were here even before we were born. Anyone with a clear mind will see this 
 "We the Living" is an autobiographical historic novel of Ayn Rand's life in the Soviet Union during her youth from age 12 to 21, when she was able to escape to America. Every American should read this book in order to understand what the Soviet Union was all about and what totalitarian governments do to people. It is an extraordinarily cautionary tale, which is essentially a true story in essence. Of all Ayn Rand's writings, this is the one which appears to me to have the greatest literary value - and this is the one subject that Ayn Rand actually knew and lived first hand.  This book gives readers great insight in why anti-communism swept the world, and why fascists, Mussolini, Hitler and Japan's Tojo was able to use anti-communism, the legitimate fear of communism, to grasp control in their own countries, and to almost rule the world.  In fact for American to really understand anti-communism in America, and to understand WWII and the 20th century, they need to read "We The Living", a true horror story of idealistic communism in Russia. It should be used extensively in our public schools to teach civics, history, current events, and English literature. Sadly, this book is not nearly as widely read as it needs to be 
 This is the best price I have ever seen on Bulgari. I have paid upwards of $130 for this same bottle in department stores...and I didn't have to wait for a salesperson to finish a conversation before I could make my purchase 
 The conquest of the mighty Inca empire by a small contingent of Spanish adventurers, and their subsequent civil wars fought for control of the region, is a story so dramatic and improbable that it's hard to believe it actually happened.  Prescott's artistic style, meticulous attention to detail, and brilliantly structured narrative bring out all the drama and excitement.  Unlike many histories, this work has nothing about it that is tedious or dry--particularly remarkable since Prescott never visited South America and developed his sweeping account exclusively from literary sources. The author's ability to reconstruct the attitudes and motivations of the key characters gives the reader a much deeper understanding of the events. Before reading the book, I knew next to nothing about the Incas or the settlement of the region.  Upon finishing it, I felt as though I'd received a thorough (and most enjoyable) schooling 
 This recording will get any party rocking.  The choice of cover tunes are just delightful and Buster's voice is in fine form.  They rock, croon, shimee, and shuffle.  Hot Hot Hot will always live on as an ultiamte party tune.  Cannibal fits the same mode as well.  But Buster's crooning in The House Of The Rising Sun is almost unbeatable.  Good Morning Judge and Screwy Music make me laugh and Oh Me Oh My almost makes me cry with emotion.  Overall, this product is first class and will liven up anyone's day 
 Isaac Asimov's novel is based on the screenplay by Harry Kliener and a story by Otto Klement and Jay Lewis Bixby and is a very easy read. The world has been divided and battling for control for over half a century. A scientist, Benes, from the Other Side, has been vital in keeping the two factions of the world technologically even, and has now defected. He claims to have important information involving the fate of the world. Grant is the agent in charge of getting Benes to into the hands of the good side "With him in charge, I feel as safe as it is possible to feel, which isn't much. Grant ran the whole thing; flicked Benes out of Their hands like a seed out of a watermelon". However, while being transported to headquarters, the Benes is injured in an assassination attempt. Five scientists are shrunken and injected into Benes' blood stream. They must survive traveling through his body and successfully operate on a deadly blood clot in his brain. The "submarine's" journey is filled with dangers and challenges and it seems as though there is a traitor on board. "For every trick We've got, They've got a counter-trick; for every man We've got planted on Their side, They've got one planted on Ours." The only complaint is the mass amount of dialogue, the clich cast of characters might bother some people, but I thought they were humorous. Overall I found this book to be an easy-to-read, quick source of entertainment and recommend it to anyone looking for a fun read 
 AC/DC made it to the ROCK N ROLL HALL OF FAME because they stuck to their guns and just played to their strengths and capabilities. Never a love ballad in the mix, and if there was anything slow, it was always blues rooted. However, all their songs had the patented three chord crunches provided by Angus and Malcom Young and Bon Scott's vocals compliments their power. The standout song here is HELL AIN'T A BAD PLACE TO BE. The rest of LET THERE BE ROCK is typical AC/DC, all with great production.  The Scott,Young & Young songwriting team always has a touch of sly tongue-in-cheek humor which always told the fans that AC/DC took their music seriously, but didn't take themselves too seriously 
 the more I love the writings of John Grisham.  This is definately one of his shorter ones but it's not "short" on a good story.  Sometimes a good, quick read is just the thing you need to make you feel better.  I love having an author that I can just pick up and read and know it's going to be good.  
 A great blend of jazz, rock, hip-hop, funk, and electronica! Beautiful, creative, and inventive stuff! Please give it a sample 
 I felt like I was right there with her seeing what she saw, drinking all that alcohol, and having adventures in Georgia! this book gives you an idea of how Georgian people really are 
 This book is incredible.  It has been a companion of mine since it was first introduced many years ago.  This book was designed for just about anyone in mind, any age, any physical shape.  It teaches you the importance of diet and nutrition, stretching and exercise, with plenty of examples for those of us with little experience at these subjects.  This is a book for anyone who cares about the health of their body.  So get the book, and then get motivated 
 This album gets played constantly in my house.  Every number is positively brilliant, however different from one another.  The only two that I may not listen to much are Ray and Frankenstein, but the rest show that spark of "genius", and I avoid using that word for anyone.  I just read Allmusic's take on Aimee Mann and her recorded legacy, and somewhat disappointed - this album is great, as I also believe Lost in Space is.  Those are the two I usually recommend first.  Possibly pop/rock's best songwriter at the moment 
 For a number of reasons, Lester Young's sound changed after he left the Basie Band.  He changed the mouthpiece on his saxophone, resulting in a darker, lower tone;  he suffered from disappointment and depression after leaving behind his buddies in the band for a career that never really took off afterward;  his short stint in the army was a disaster;  he was drinking and smoking more and more;  and maybe he was just getting a little older and somber as well.  The result is a collection of fragile, beautiful songs.  Many fans don't care as much for this sound as they do for his early recordings, but for me, they are the most touching things he recorded.  These are the successful recordings of his "dark" period, which fell apart during the fifties, making a mess of his career.  But for this brief period, his genius really shines through 
 Athletes of all sports will benefit from these simple training plans.  There are also a great index and useful nutrition plans 
 Both my husband and I are really enjoying these CD's. I love having the variety of subjects so we don't have to listen to the same meditiation over and over again. I love how there's two meditations on some of the CD's. It's great for beginners who want good information and a meditation from someone who is down to earth and not extremely metaphysical. He explains his ideas but doesn't preach them like they are the ultimate answer.  He does talk a bit fast but these are not relaxaton CD's. They are to work on your psychic abilities. We got used to it quickly and now appreciate it since we've listened to them enough. With all the information on the CD's I feel they are well worth the money. 
 In "The World Philosophers," Heilbroner provides a very accessible introduction to the history of economic thought.  He uses clear prose to trace the ascendance of central economic theories, explaining the particular social contexts that helped shape the influential works of Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, Joseph Schumpeter, as well as that of other "minor" figures.   However, those who wish to probe deeper into the development of economic thought may find this text inadequate.  Heilbroner does not explain in detail the economic theories of the major figures, and devotes little space to those who some would call "lesser" figures, such as John Stuart Mill, Stanley Jevons, and Francis Edgeworth.    More than that, Heilbroner devotes only a few pages to Alfred Marshall, a seminal figure in the "marginal revolution," a movement that facilitated the rise of neoclassical economics.  For those who desire a slightly more rigorous introduction to the history of economic thought, I would recommend "A History of Economic Thought" by William J. Barber.    That being said, Heilbroner's text is well worth reading for those new to either the history of economic thought or the discipline of economics in general. 
 Everyone remembers the 1963 series where Dr. Richard Kimble (David Janssen) goes running around in every episode just missing the criminal that killed his wife. He in turn is being chased by Lt. Philip Gerard (Barry Morse) who thinks Kimble did it and is a fugitive from the law. The whole thing was narrated by William Conrad.  Well now we have the movie. This time we have a beginning middle and ending all in 161 minutes.   Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) and his wife Helen (Sela Ward) are the perfect couple. Then one night while he was working for some inexplicable reason a despicable person dispatches Helen. On her way to the netherworld she inadvertently says Richard on the 911 call. One thing leads to another and Kimble gets the blame. In the process of transporting him from one containment system to another the transport meets with a little accident; now Kimble is free to find locate the real perpetrator. Now it is up to Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) to find and retrieve Kimble.  Now that we have covered the basic there is not where to begin to tell how great this movie is on many levels. The anticipation of the chase of Kimble to find the perpetrator (by the way he has only one arm) before Gerard catches him. We get close and have a few read herrings. Tommy Lee gets to keep his stoic look as he says things like "I don't care." And "I don't bargain."   Personaly I think that the Chicago police knew all along who the real bad guy was and was covering for him several times right up to the end. They went out of there way to paint Kimble as the bad guy.  Detective Rosetti (Joseph F. Kosala) also tried to stop him from revealing the real perpetrator. Rosetti referring to Kimball even after the truth is revealed "He's going down. You won't help us, you stay the hell out!" 
 So Long Scarecrow by Scarling is amazing! Since purchasing the album several months ago, it still remains the one album I have listened to everyday. Yes it really is that good. I can't even pick out a favourite song for you because they all rock! The angry guitar sound works perfectly in contrast with the sweet sounding vocals of the lead singer Jessicka.  A truly splendid album.  Buy it...  Now 
 I've tried several different laptop bags, from over the shoulder to carry to backpack.  I really like this one because I can put everything in it and it doesn't feel heavy.  It has a separate compartment for the cords which is great and also a place for my mp3 and a water bottle in addition to the normal pen and paper area.  Lots of pockets...I love it 
 This book is great, but definitly for a child who is very careful with books.  We bought it for our son when he was 4 and just bought it for a cousin's daughter who is 3. It really depends on the child.  The pop ups are amazing though...and once the child is older will still be a book they can use because of all the detailed descriptions.  I don't think we've ever read the book from cover to cover - more like an encyclopedia 
 It's a great book. The photos are fantastic and the commentary is interesting and informative. However, I was quite surprised (like others who reviewed it) that the list doesn't include some fantastic shows: Camelot, Rent, Jesus Christ Superstar, Into the Woods, Chess, Pippin, Grease, The Secret Garden, The Wiz, Miss Saigon, Godspell, Oliver, and truly one of the greatest shows, Sunday in the Park with George, NOT listed! What a disappointment!! And these are the shows I actually own the cast albums for! I guess you can't win them all.. 
 Miss Julia and Sam Murdoch have eloped to the Smoky Mountains and have had a family honeymoon at Dollywood.  Unfortunately, there seems to be some doubt as to whether the wedding chapel preacher is really qualified to perform weddings.  Since proper behavior is #1 with Miss Julia, she tells Sam that they must have separate quarters until the marriage mystery is cleared up.  Meanwhile Hazel Marie, Miss Julia's erstwhile housemate, is involved in a beauty pageant which will raise money for the sheriff's department.  She, Miss Julia, and the flirtatious Etta Mae Wiggins, are in charge of the pageant and the contestants, a rag-tag group of six girls which present a real challenge to their mentors.  This book is not quite as much fun as its predecessors in the series, because of Miss Julia's unfounded concerns about Sam's fidelity and whether he truly wants to be married to her.  Otherwise, it's the usual romp with the characters which have become to beloved in the other books 
 Capt. Hastings was back in England.  His beloved Cinders has died,  their children settled into their own lives and now Hastings is rather at loose ends when Hercule Poirot contacts him.  Poirot, it seems, is staying at Styles, the country house where the two had met and had their first adventure all those years before.  Once Hastings gets there he discovers that changes had occured even there.  No longer a private home, Styles is now a guest house and filled with an assortment of guests, including his youngest daugther, Judith, her employer and his wife.  Change too has come to his old friend, Poirot is now confined to a wheelchair and attended not by his longtime valet but instead by a new man.  One thing has not changed though, Poirot's little grey cells are still active.  He tells Hastings that he is on the trail of a murderer, tells Hastings of several crimes but then refuses to tell Hastings anymore.  Hastings tries to puzzle out what his old friend is up to but he is also distracted by worry for his daughter who seems to be infatuated with a most unsuitable man.  This is the final Poirot case, although it was not the last one Christie wrote.  She wrote this during WWII and had it safely locked away for years to ensure that no other author would attempt to continue Poirot's adventures after her death.  As always with Christie's work, the clues are all present for the reader to try to follow, the plot is clever and challenging but I doubt that this will ever become anyone's favorite novel.    This is absolutely NOT the book to begin reading about Poirot, nor would I recommend it to anyone who had read only a few of the novels.  This is for a true fan only, one who has read most, if not all the previous works, for it truly is the great detective's swan song, much more than Christie's send offs for Miss Marple (SLEEPING MURDER) or Tommy and Tuppence (POSTERN OF FATE) 
 Outstanding analysis and an extremely well thought out system for the continual improvement of all processes, be they manufacturing or service . . . whatever the industry.  The author's writing style is blunt and pulls  no punches, but is engaging and entertaining while dealing with very  serious business issues.  A must read for anyone involved in continual  improvement 
 Maybe some people can get it through humor. I hope so. 
 I think I have every one of Dr. Bernie Siegel's books.  I started in 1990 when I was diagnosed with cancer and needed some support and information.  I have recently returned to them again due to a heart attack.  Bernie is the most compassionate doctor I have ever encountered.  He understands the connection between mind, body, and emotions thoroughly and offers concrete suggestions for making life better no matter what physical ailments may assail you.  His other books dealt heavily with getting what you need when hospitalized and from your doctor and other medical staff.  This book focuses on simply living life to the fullest, as he says, "between office visits".  It is a wonderfully uplifting and  encouraging book and I highly recommend it to anyone: patient, loved one, medical staff, and general public.  I believe there is something in it for everyone 
 I've been searching for a Middle Eastern cookbook for so long. My search has finally ended with this cookbook! Like everyone else here, I have tried several of the recipes and they have all turned out wonderfully! (Basbousa from Egypt, Pastitso from Greece, and lots others!). The people at amazon here stated that it includes recipes from Israel---- that isn't true. There are no Jewish recipes in the book.....only from the Arabs of Palestine 
 This book is fabulous. The stories, art, and other information within it are absolutely wonderful. I think this should be the greatest coffee table book of all time, and I infact have it sitting on my tale in my living room and find myself flipping through it from time to time. I suggest every Mason, and every person interested in Masonic history get a copy of this book for their personal library, even if it is the only book they ever own.  -Ryan Mercer Speedway, IN #729 F&AM 
 One of the first Pokemon movies and its still getting plenty of use in our household.  Great buy 
 These are truely wonderful singing voices,backed up by a beautiful orchestra.The first song actually gave me chills.I can't wait to buy another one of their CD's.I recommend it highly to anyone who loves REAL music 
 This book is an awesome find. I discovered it over seven years ago when I was in college and still refer to now that I'm more experienced with cooking. It explains the basics and assumes that you know nothing. It leaves nothing to chance and most of the recipes have a short list of ingredients so you aren't stuck with extra stuff that can't be used again until you repeat that dish. If you are debating between this book and another, this is the one to buy. 
 I have always been made fun of for my fascination with Scritti, but then I always saw them as a changing entity loosly held together by Green's changing musical moods/accomplishments, not just as the pop group of Cupid.  His lyrics have always been great to read, and weird to hear-a satisfying suprise of non-conformist writing.  As deconstructed as the early work is, it makes sense not only for the time in which it was written, but it also fits with the whole Scritti catalogue.  Cool stuff, and fun to listen to.  
 Vernon  Geberth did not just write a book entitled SEX RELATED HOMICIDE AND DEATH INVESTIGATION: PRACTICAL AND CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES. He has created a portable, hand held training simulator for the response to and investigation of the sex-related homicide. As the reader makes his way through each chapter,you are hit with the same initial shock and revulsion of a sex-related homicide scene. By providing the reader with dozens of photos, analysis, techniques and checklists, Geberth brings you as close to a real time crime scene as possible.In creating this atmosphere Vernon prepares the reader, whether cop or prosecutor, when called upon to investigate the sex related homicide, to professionally deal with the depravity and inhumanity of this evil act and to maintain your professional objective and in so doing focus your efforts toward the only goal that matters "...to see that justice is done not only for the deceased but for the surviving family as well. 
 HIDDEN RICHES is a tale about an antique dealer (Dora Conroy) who buys some items for her shop at an auction and becomes the target of an international criminal. Enter Jed Skimmerhorn (where did she get that name?) who is an ex-cop and new neighbor of Dora's. His attraction to her causes him to jump back into the crime game to protect Dora at all costs. They have to figure out why she is the target and they find out that treasures can be hidden almost anywhere. Of course they have to battle a mutual attraction along the way!  Ok, this theme has been done over and over again, but not was well as Nora Roberts does it! Once again she adds romance and mystery together for her own special blend of wonderful reading. She does it so well, that I've forgotten if she writes a better romance novel or mystery. She always has strong characters and interesting locations. She doesn't buy into the one weak and one strong character issue, but instead combines passion, strong wills, intelligence, etc. This is a much more realistic view of people in today's world.  I've read most of her books, and with the exception of a few Silhouette Romance novels in the beginning of her career, I haven't found any that I didn't like. I've especially enjoyed her latest (actually those from the last 5 or so years!) which combine the genres and create a fictional account that is her own extraordinary writing style and has something for every type of reader! 
 Set in a Czech village during the Nazi occupation, a poor fix-it man is appointed "Aryan comptroller" of a button shop owned by an old, almost deaf Jewess. At first the man figures to take advantage of her for his own gain, but she doesn't understand his position and thinks of him as her "assisstant." They become fond of each other, and when the Jews are eventually rounded up for deportation, he tries to protect her.   It's not easy for him, however, because he knows if caught he'll be killed: it's quite a tug-of-war with his conscience - and very realistic. To the movie's great credit there is no sentimental heroics displayed here - in fact, he's ready to turn her in to save his own neck. (It's the same moral dilemma Huck goes through on the raft involving Jim.) In a fracas with her he accidentally kills her. Broken in every way, he soon hangs himself.   The ending is the movie's only flaw, only because it's too drawn out, with a surrealistic dream sequence included in which he assumes the role of her husband, both dressed in old costume. But up to that it's a great picture, very moving and poignant; the woman (played by Ida Kaminska) is simply fantastic. 
 What beautiful writing! It's pointed out in the intro that, more than most of us, her world was shaped with WORDS. I've only read about four essays so far, and am profoundly touched. I've always admired Helen Keller, but am newly re-impressed with her wisdom and vision, and touched that she can write so clearly as to make me feel how little she felt limited by her handicap. If Helen Keller had simply learned to behave and ask politely for her food, etc, it would have been an impressive accomplishment. The fact that she grew to fully embrace her intelligence, her world and her potential . . . wow. I know so many people who are content to just do the bare minimum, to not stretch their limits at all, to not show any intellectual curiosity . . . she had the perfect excuse to exert the least effort, yet she didn't. Once she was given the key, the entree to humanity, she didn't let her handicaps stop her. I love that even all these years later, she is still able to share that 
 The hero is a journalist who writes stories about the paranormal who may have certain abilities himself. Tragic events in the first episode bring him in contact with Louise Jameson (of Dr. Who fame) and a government agency which also investigates the paranormal.   As the first reviewer, I must give a little of the history of this negleted treasure. This is from my own memory, so bare with me.  Nearly 30 years ago, long before X-Files, this series dealt with a secret branch of government investigating paranormal matters. I watched it way back then, and enjoyed it greatly. I would talk to people about it but NOBODY heard of it.  It was never released on VHS nor was it rerun. I am so glad they are now available on DVD.   What happened to it was that there was a censorship campaign against it. An influential crusader against controversial shows denoounced Omega and the BBC buckled. A strange claim, since the show is a fairly tame treatment of ghosties, government conspiracies, witches, mind control, cults, and what not. Apparently the crusade worked well, because it was canceled after a season and laid unspoken of in the BBC vaults all these years.  That's the official version anyway. I happen to think the powers that be did not like the undercurrents of government mind control experiments. The third episode features a backstory of sonic devices for crowd control that we use today.  The crew did fairly well with a desperately low budget. Location shooting in spooky Scotland greatly enhanced the shows. They scattered in some interesting background music. Look out for cuts from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, and a little bit of the obscure Tangerine Dream albumn, Richochet.  Quality of the DVD is good considering the ill treatment of the source material.  There is a commentary track, and a featurette which are nice extras. A good set. Should be a good buy for anyone interested in lesser known works in the genre 
 I have to say this album is the best by Westlife thus far. I'm ashamed to admit that I first thought it would just be "okay" without Bryan (Brian, whatever) McFadden. But they have really proven me wrong. This CD is awesome. I LOVE the covers. That's always been something I like about Westlife. Anyway, here's is the song by song deal.   YOU RAISE ME UP- I liked this song by Westlife, but it's very hard to make a better version than Josh Groban. His voice is amazing.  WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME- I first heard this song on American Idol last season. I think they even released it?? But I do like the song and Diana Ross is a great match for Westlife. AMAZING- I love this song. Mark is great here. THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL FIND LOVE- Great song. I like how Shane sings pretty high in parts.  SHE'S BACK- I had not heard this song before hearing it from Westlife. Regardless, it's a great song. I love the "Tell me why the hell I hear music..." part.  DESPERADO- Before hearing this album, I thought Clint Black had sung the best version. But I now know that Westlife has taken that top spot.  COLOUR MY WORLD- This is my favorite song on the album. I can't even believe Mark's voice. Awesome. And Shane really puts a lot into it, too.  IN THIS LIFE- I had only heard Colin Raye sing this before hearing it here. I have to say I like Colin Raye's just a tad better. But it really was a great choice to put it on this album. HEART WITHOUT A HOME- I loved this song from Nick Carter and I love it from Westlife. HIT YOU WITH THE REAL THING- This song reminds me of "Everyone" from BSB's Black and Blue album. The background does anyway.  CHANGE YOUR MIND- My favorite after Colour My World. I love the upbeat nature. It's one of those songs that puts a smile on your face.  MAYBE TOMORROW- I love this song. I can't believe it's not on some of the other version of FACE TO FACE that have been released.  I definitely recommend buying this album and any by Westlife. I just wish they were as big here in the US as they are worldwide 
 Have you noticed that in spite of great increases in wealth and improvements in technology in the last few decades, people don't seem to be any happier today than they used to be?  Lane tackles this question head on, and finds some interesting answers.  This book modestly blows most of today's conventional economics right out of the water.    Conventional economic wisdom is that increased GDP will solve all problems and make everyone's life better.  Lane shows this isn't so.  For the very poor, increased per capita GDP does indeed make people happier.  Once the necessities of life are satisfied, higher GDP has little or no effect on how content people are with their lives.  When you consider the lengths to which governments go to increase their GDP by a few percentage points, you begin to understand how important this finding is.    In the developed countries, Lane shows that people's overall satisfaction with their lives has been declining steadily in recent years.  Lane finds that a decline in companionship and family life and an increase in television viewing are important factors in this.  People are often not very good judges of what life choices will really make their lives better and happier.  It is easy to fall into a trap of trying to get more money, while sacrificing the time it takes to maintain relationships with friends and family.    Some great quotes from the book: ". . . relieving poverty without creating dependency has proved difficult where it has been seriously tried." "Consequently, it is possible to want to spend more than one earns--a sure prescription for misery, as Micawber once explained to David Copperfield." ". . . that magnificent apparatus of economic analysis might be turned to the purpose of improving well-being."  Lane does miss some things.  I suspect that in the U.S. at least, part of the reason for the decline in happiness relates to the fact that people move around so much, which makes keeping up regular contact with relatives and friends difficult.  The tendency for more people to attend college, and to go to colleges hundreds of miles away from their families, contributes to this rootless trend.  I tend to think that Americans work more hours, and are encouraged to carry more debt, than is really good for society. I also suspect that the spread-out design of American cities, and the resulting huge time costs of commuting, play a role.  For more on this, see Kunstler's book "The Geography of Nowhere."  As to the book itself, the writing is rather stodgy and academic.  Lane hammers on the details of what studies show about life satisfaction and happiness, what the flaws of the various studies are, how the questions were asked, which results are the most robust.  Lane is not trying to write an exciting book, he's trying to prove his points beyond doubt.  I think he succeeds in that.    Lane sometimes seems to be asking more questions than he answers.  There are enough possible topics for further research presented here to keep an army of graduate students busy.  Unlike most economists and political scientists working today, though, I think Lane is asking the right questions.  What kind of future do we really want?  One in which everyone works 70-hour weeks, makes lots of money, and lives miserable and alone in a huge house? Or maybe we can come up with something better?  Given the ecological pressures caused by the current lifestyles in the developed countries, rethinking this may be a matter of the survival of our civilization.  
 This book can truly bring about the kind of healing that our nation so desperately needs.  Though the stories are sometimes painful to read, I think it is necessary for each and every one of us to read about the experiences of others during this tragic time while remembering the way we felt.  The authors have truly done this nation a world of good by getting this project together so quickly.  They must surely have been led by a higher power.  God bless them and God bless America 
 R.R. Windsor is right in saying that the Hebrews were Blacks.  The White Jews are the Pharisees, Sadducees and Gentiles mentioned in the Bible. They later fled back to Europe and joined forces with the Khazars.  The so-called Jews of today are mostly the Khazars.  I also recommend "Retake Your Fame," by Aylmer von Fleischer.  
 Despite the marketing of the book as a "how to" in isolating destructive types conquering your life in which it succeeds..the book itself is also a lucid study in dealing with the questions surrounding human motivation, nature nurture arguements,inflation of ego,the clash between rugged individualism and the common good as well as clarity in outlining the arguments with evolutionary biology and psychology as to the future of mankind and the creation of a just society based on conscience. The idea of conscience as distinct from authority or shame(superego) is where the author treads in difficult waters. What rules the heart or the mind? How does mental health balance the 2 and perhaps dealing with Jung here might have shed some light on her possible inconclusive conclusions. Obviously, the author sympathizes with the heart (her like of Buddhist/Hindu psychology) and emphasis on the responsibility of love as distinct from perhaps a linear view of history whose reliance on strict justice and progression as a divine plan is skirted here as somehow leading to forms of excessive domination and cruelty is a point well taken in a world perennially battling between universalism and nationalism/parochialism. This conflict it seems will always be with us, as Krishnamurti wryly observes and given credence by the author who quotes him. Just where conscience,this vague emotion,fleeting feeling comes from perhaps leads to recognition of a divine soul whose definition can remain in the vogue as something undefineable and undescribeable but as the author points out the meaning of life.   
 I have had this very Bacon Press for many years and I would not trade it for anything.  I have seen others that are "flimsy" in comparison.  I have never used it to cook bacon, though I'm sure it works well.  I use it for "grilling" bagels in my Lodge fry pan.  Heat the pan, melt a "pat" of butter, slice the bagel, put the exposed surfaces of the bagel face down in the pan and set the Bacon Press on top.  You won't believe how quickly and evenly it toasts the bagel surface to perfection, while leaving the rest soft and fresh. Hot, delicious and ready for any toping of your choice.  Now that, my friend, is how to eat a bagel! 
 I'm a senior at FSU, and I read this in order to prepare myself for the creative side of advertising/ portfolio/grad school. It was on the recommended reading for more then one of the top ad schools. Originally, I found it thru the VCU website. I have to say, that as a creative writing student, I barely get any kind of advice on the advertising world. This book, was phenomenal for several reasons. First and foremost,I learned what I consider to be a great deal. Secondly, and most importantly, I laughed the entire time. Luke Sullivan is a fantastic writer, whom I feel lucky to have stumbled upon his book. I believe anyone can benefit from this easy read. It has helped give me a a great overview. On that note, I was wondering if there was a way to contact him? I'd love to pick his brain :). Fantastic book. Wish there were more like it

 As most of the other reviewers, I can only confirm my admiration for this book. As an expat living in Germany (Berlin) I am constantly thinking: "did this really happen in this country?". Probably the greatest lesson in the book is never to take the actual (political, economic,...) situation for granted. This book makes you think. Vol. 2 is already waiting on my shelf, and I've been reading the opening chapter of that one. I can only say this: anyone should read this book, lessons are to be learned. 
 I see that a lot of people who commented on this book did not find it quite up to par with Joust. I certainly disagree, although I must say I am extremely biased toward Lackey books. I think she is a wonderful author and since I expect her books to be great, I usually find that they are. Alta gets more into the descriptions of the city, and the formation of the new dragon riders. There is a bit of romance in this story, as well as tragedy. I personally thought it was a good sequel, and would recommend it to anyone who reads fantasy 
 Overall I enjoyed listening to this book.  However, I felt as though it had a little too many twists and turns.  I agree with another review that it sort of tanked at the end. But, I would still recommend it.  The book takes place in Philadelphia.  Since I am originally from this city and I currently work down there is was pleasant to hear all of the references to Philly's land marks.  Also, there were a lot of Catholic references through out the book.  Considering that is how I was raised, I could relate very much to the main character.   Finally one of reviews on this site mention a lot of foul language.  Give me a break. That is how people talk. Especially when they are going through what all of the characters of this book are dealing with.  It made the dialog more genuine. Get over it. 
 First, before this film I didn't thought that Leonardo DiCaprio is a very good actor. I haven't liked his performance in many of his films. Due of this fact, I watched The Man In The Iron Mask, expecting not to enjoy the film, simply because he basic plays the main character. Needless to say, I was speechless at the end of the film.   The Man In The Iron Mask is stunning and Leonardo's performance - I hate to say - is also stunning. Additionally I have not enjoyed many musketeer films in the past, so obviously I did not expect to enjoy this.   The Man In The Iron Mask is beautiful and memorizing, I have not seen the original version (as this is a remake) nor have I read the book. Therefore I did not know what to expect from this film and the twists really were twist for me.   Film is definitely have to be in Gold Home DVD-Collection. Film deserves 5 
 I usually don't write reviews for the same series (I mean, how often and how many different ways can you say why you like a book series, eh?) but this was a must write review.  Why?  Because around the middle of this series things got a little slow, a little creaky, a little uneven.  Nothing unusual, really, for a series.  Same thing's happened in other series I can think of.  But the Stephanie Plum books have bounced back, folks.  This is a very, very funny book.  That is the first thing that must be said.  They're all funny, of course, even the books that were a little less than great.  But this book is simply brilliant.  No, it is not believable.  For crying out loud, who would think a book about a former lingerie salesperson turned bounty hunter (in Trenton NJ, no less) was going to be believable anyway?  So, yes, this book and the others are over the top.  Way, way over the top.  But brilliantly so.  The pacing, the plot (such as it is), the mystery (such as it is), the characters, the dialogue, the scenes, the scenarios, the adventures, all come together in a brilliant, cannot put down, laugh out loud book.  I don't think I went more than a page or two without laughing at something that was happening.  It is a great Stephanie Plum adventure, typically light on anything that could even vaguely be construed as serious, but hilarious to read.  You can get a sense of the story itself from other reviews.  If you like zany madcap stories that are indeed rather unrealistic, than you should read this series, from the beginning, and as you pass by the middle of the series, keep in mind that the adventures you are reading about (that are still quite good) will get much, much better in later books 
 An excellent writer, Yancey puts together a challenging, informative look at the Old Testament.  The book covers Job, Psalms, Deuteronomy, Ecclesiastes and the Prophets.  Like Yancey's other books, this one delves into the intellectual struggles that Christians have with God and His word, the Bible.  It is obvious that the author has spent incredible time and thought into these "problems" facing Christians and even the credibility of Christianity.  And though these struggles are namely intellectual, rarely do they exclude the emotions as the Old Testament reveals.  Job, like us, didn't understand why he was suffering.  He didn't understand why bad things happen to good people and vice versa.  Certainly a loving, caring God wouldn't allow his children to go through such trials and hardships.  Yancey doesn't offer any hard and fast answers, but does a great job of showing how these struggles are common to even Old Testament heroes, and in the end we need to rest in God's goodness.  God allowed the hardship in Job's life to prove his faith; essentially God was showing Job off.    In the other chapters of the book, Yancey discusses similar issues to those faced in the book of Job.  The last chapter recaps the book and offers a philosophical answer to all the "why" questions that crop up in our faith as Christians, the answer lies in the redeemer of the world, who hasn't yet redeemed this earth completely yet.  Our final answer to life should be the cry of Job, who like us, didn't have a  lot of answers to the tough questions.  This was his cry, "I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the end he will stand on this earth."  Yancey is a great author in many ways, but I especially appreciate his humility and realness in his writing.  He doesn't ever settle for clichés which regularly pepper Christian writing.  He isn't out to make himself the hero of every example and story, and often he does the opposite, he makes himself the goat of his stories.  Also characteristic of Yancey's writing is strict adherence to the Scriptures.  This book especially shows the value the author puts on the authority of God's Word and the importance of using the Bible in life 
 We have been to Sicily three times and find the Rough Guide to be  unerringly on target.  Its assessments of the priority of things to see and  do, its reviews of sights, hotels, restaurants have been the most helpful  of the many guides we used.  Short on color photos but long on info, the  rough guide let us find the beauty quickly to see and taste it for  ourselves, and steered us to many interesting places in Palermo, Patti,  Milazzo, Messina and Syracuse

 If you are a Christian woman in need of a real heroine, who shares your desires, hopes, struggles, and fears, you will find it in Katy, the character of Mrs. Prentiss' book, Stepping Heavenward.  I was so despondent of all the heroines in literature, who seem to have little to no real relationship with Christ.  However, this book answered my plea and then some.  I will read this over and over.  Stepping Heavenward will meet you whereever you are, Christian woman!  If you are sixteen, twenty-five, or eighty.  This book lays the female Christian heart on the line, and does so with stunning accuracy and detail to Biblical doctrine.  You will laugh, cry, be convicted, comforted and reminded over and over and over that we will be in His Kingdom because He died for us, and no other reason!  And that in this present world there is hope, and sanctification will happen because He is so diligent to see to it 
 This is a very specific book design for people who already know how to skate, turn and stop.  A lot of the information are useful in here but beside of this book, I suggest you buy another book that teaches techniques.  Unless you are a very good skater of course 
 This is a true masterpiece from the master of the genre. I would probably rank it alongside the Bourne Identity. This book goes way beyond the usual twists and turns found in a standard Ludlum novel.  The plot involves two principal characters, both at the top of their profession but also sworn enemies. The confrontation scene between Scofield and Talenikov is probably the most dramatic and intense scene among all Ludlum's books.  From that point on the plot unfolds and is logically carried forward to its conclusion. The tension and conflicts between two former enemy spies now working together is brought out very nicely and has a substantial human element to it.  The reader cannot help admiring the two central characters as the book unfolds. The well developed strong central characters and the complexities and tensions associated with working together as brought out in this book are the main reasons why this book is a must read for Ludlum fans 
 always something a little different in a g.p.n. release.  this one doesnt LET UP. must have for your collection.  smooth on I DONT LIVE HERE ANYMORE. KICKIN ON BUNK HOUSE BOOGIE.

 Now featuring a new afterword by author Charles C. Alexander (Professor Emeritus Of History at Ohio University), Ty Cobb is the classic biography of one of baseball's most brilliant, volatile, and intimidating presences. An inset section of black-and-white photographic plates illustrate this chronicle of not only Ty Cobb's robust life, but also the startling transformations taking place during twentieth-century baseball. A fascinating, deftly researched and highly readable "must-have" for fans of baseball legends 
 thank you for a great book 
 I've had the Nova Blue full set for years.  No problems.  And when I break a plate, I can easily find a replacement.  Boot 
 Virginia Woolf is simply a genious. A must-read for anyone who enjoyed any of her earlier works. This is, of course, her last piece of work she wrote before walking into the river in 1941. It really shows how this person has achieved a unique style of writing and her own voice in literature. Very mature, interesting and entertaining for those who are willing to open up their minds 
 Full of great information and very well-written, this book is perfect for those parents who are probably more comfortable fixing a computer or installing stereo equipment. The references to the baby as your "new model" can get a bit stale after awhile, but the overall effect is to take away some of the fear factor for new parents and replace it with a sense of excitement and knowledge 
 It was great to read about Lucien and Nicholas again, and Lucien's wife, Beth was a wonderful and intelligent woman.  I didn't like that Lucien's ex-mistress Blanche was in it so much, and I especially didn't like the way she spoke to Nicholas about his own ex-mistress in front of the sweet Eleanor.  All in all, though, this is a wonderful, wonderful book 
 I am a big reader, but in general, I'm a big reader of short novels. I just don't handle the large ones too well, and that's why I've been slow to get to David Copperfield. I've read a lot of Dickens's other stuff, and I've loved it all. I count Hard Times and A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol and a couple of others among my favorites. I was never able to make myself read David Copperfield though.  Until the last several weeks. I decided that it would be good for me to get through the whole thing, and I must say that it was a rewarding experience.   I particularly enjoyed the comedy of the novel. It has some of Dickens's most humorous moments and characters. Mr. and Mrs. Micawber are the sort of characters you know even before reading the novel, and the novel really starts going once they appear. Mr. [...] and David's aunt provide nice moments, too.  And, of course, there's that Dickensian melodrama that we all love. That's probably why this book has been so popular through the years. David is a likeable character (particularly when he grows up), and his life definitely has its traumas and its highs. David's appealing, and it's pretty easy to become emotionally attached to the fellow as he makes mistakes and experiences triumphs and dark times. That's one thing about a thousand page novel; you get a little of everything.  There's plenty of interesting social commentary, particularly on the role of women. Dickens's philosophy on love it pretty evident, too, in the later stages of the novel, and that's pretty interesting.  So, it's a good book for all those who like the big novel, and for all those who like Dickens, it's, of course, a cannot miss. It's long but worth it 
 "Marketing to Women" isn't just a collection of polls and observations pulled together by someone looking to write a bestseller. There is hard science to back up many of Barletta's assertions about how men and women see the world differently, and why marketers should care.  The main reason why we should care, is $6,144,000,000,000. Yes, that 6 is in the TRILLIONS column. That's how much money American women spend in a year, according to a 2004 "Time" magazine report.   Barletta presents a comprehensive, if often strident, explanation of what business owners stand to lose if their advertising doesn't drop two persistent beliefs about society: that men do the spending, and that youth is all everyone cares about. She gives many examples of companies that have moved beyond those beliefs, and ways that other industries can do the same.   One of her standout case studies is Lowe's Home Improvement Stores. In the "men's world" of home improvement, women actually make most purchases (over 60%) and drive 80% of them. Lowe's noticed that, and their efforts to make their stores physically and psychologically appealing to women have paid off. As she explains, there is more to catching our fancy than producing a line of pink hand tools (that's condescending), but catch it you can (with better lighting and bigger paint departments).  The book does have a shortcoming, though, and it's a big one. Barletta has an axe to grind, and she wants to do it on the forehead of the nearest male. She isn't content to let her large collection of both social and scientific data make her case for marketing to women. Her snide remarks weaken her case on two fronts: by turning off the very people who stand to gain the most from her research, and by damaging her reputation as a leader in her field.   But if you can ignore the sniping-and I strongly suggest that you do-this book may be the single most profitable purchase you're going to make in a long time. 
 The system where I store backups and archives failed. I needed SOME way to access the data on the 300GB drive that was there. Did not have time or inclination to troubleshoot the system, so elected to try Nexstar LX external enclosure. In use for about a week now.   Installation - could not have been easier. Manual is comprehensive and includes photos that could be better, but are adequate. Includes screenshots of software setup with explanation of each screen. Step-by-step was good and complete. Nothing missed, nothing left to question. Space inside the enclosure is TIGHT. But, there is enough room to install the drive and route the cables. One photo illustrates exactly how to fold the data ribbon so it fits snugly and neatly.   Functionality - GOOD thing: Includes a USB 2.0 port so you can use it like a normal USB external drive. Plugged it in, powered it up (ext power supply) using the (another good thing) power switch. Stood right up under WinXP Pro SP2 WITH NTFS formatting. So I was able to grab critical backups and data and temporarily move them to a drive on my system. Beyond Compare (http://www.scootersoftware.com/)was great here. When that was complete, used the tray icon to remove the drive and power down. Removed USB cable and installed network cable. NOTE: While powered down, I made a point of entering the NexStar LX MAC address in my router MAC Address Filter table. This IS NOT covered in the docs. So if you have any peculiar network settings, like this, the docs do not address them.   When I turned on the drive, I followed the instructions to open a web browser page and enter \\storage on the url address line. Opened up the login dialog box for the configuration pages. Not really much to do here. I DID try exiting after I completed to see if it would recognize the NTFS formatting. It would not. So I had to re-enter the NexStar config utility and format the drive. Took a couple of SECONDS for a 300GB drive so guessing it was a "quick" reformat. I used the included SMB Server screen to create folders. Again, could not have been easier. Just to experiment, I password protected one. Still VERY easy.   USE - With folders created I was ready to start using the network to copy/move files to the NexStar LX drive. I set up shares on the systems on my network to use the folders on the NexStar. Easy, worked very well. I used Beyond Compare to copy files from folders on my internal drive over to the Nexstar and to check that everything is the "same".   I'm pretty much ready to settle down to normal use. In fact I manually did weekly backups on a work notebook last night and it was like using a shared drive in my desktop for the backups. The folders were recognized, backups moved along swiftly and everything worked as advertised.   NOTES - When I was using the USB connection, the fan was so loud, I was sure I would need hearing protection to be in the same rooom with it. I'd read about this in other reviews. I removed the cover to see if that would help. It did not. Of course, I had to move the case around to change from USB to Network cables connection. After I did that, it's been whisper quiet. The case is plastic. I was a little leary of this. But it's sturdy and not really "chintsy". VERY nice finish (I have a black case). I wonder if I did not shift something around when I moved the case to unplug USB and connect CatV that may have been rubbing the fan. Now it is no louder than the SimpleTech USB drive next to it.   If it continues to perform as it is now, I'll be very happy with the solution.  Addendum: 03 Nov 06 - I originally wrote this on 26 Aug 06. Since then, the NexStar LX has performed FLAWLESSLY. AND, it's very quiet. I left the default setting to let the drive sleep when not in use. So when I first access the drive there is a momentary delay while it spins up. Once it does, it runs just fine. I am backing up several different categories of files (my shareware library, MP3s, images, etc) almost every night of the week with Cobian. This is the combination I dreamt about. I could not be more pleased. I could not recommend it higher. 
 I looked at each page and checked the ingredients to see if they were the same as what my grandmother and aunts use in their dishes.  I must say, "Without a doubt there are authentic southern dishes in this book!"   
 The author deserves praise for her reasonableness, allowing for a distinction between "methodological" and "philosophical naturalism" (e.g. page 65), according to which many scientists, as she acknowledges, use the methods of science while philosophically theists.  However, one of the stumbling blocks in her and others' arguments, as indicated in my heading, is that "antievolutionists" (or those partly so) are relegated to adherents of a religion. This of course is a factor in court decisions adducing the First Amendment. But in arguments it is a form of the "ad hominem" fallacy, directing debates at the person instead of the subject matter.  Another problem is leaning on language, as in the above "naturalism". A persistent distinction is made between the "natural" and "supernatural", the latter understandably dismissed as not conducive to demonstration. But if theistic issues like purpose in phenomena are considered as part of the world, they become accessible to scrutiny like other worldly matters. Also linguistically, the author strives to distinguish scientific meanings from ordinary ones of words like "facts" and "theories" (p.11 and following). She puts theories on top of the list in scientific importance, and facts on the bottom. She calls facts "confirmed observations", and contends they, and laws, change with new findings. This omits then actualities that are independent of man's determinations, since theories and hypotheses, the other items there named, are likewise admitted to be changeable. Facts and laws of nature are usually considered such independent actualities, and findings that do not comport with them are concluded not to be facts or laws. Ironically, the author mentions (p.241) scientific claims that "Evolution is a FACT!", elevating fact above theory.  The point is that however she tries to give primacy to inconclusive theory, there are conclusive actualities out there regardless of how named. The author calls theories explanations, presumably mainly causal explanations, and that they are not demonstrated even if implying observed realities I pointed out in the review here of "Breaking the Spell". There I also brought up why the principal Darwinian contention that adaptation in organisms results from aimless changes is false, as I fully describe in my book beside its treatment of other questions of knowledge. Let me repeat the here concerned reasoning.  The arguments about whether organisms adapt at random or by purpose have revolved around their functional structure, in likeness to the structure of human artifacts, discussed in the past in support of purposeful design. What both sides of the arguments failed to consider is the difference between life and the lifeless. Organisms are distinguished not only by their structure but also by their activities. And it is these where, unlike in structure alone, the presence of aims is unquestionable. Organisms aim in all their behavior toward preservation of themselves and their species. It is accordingly needless to argue whether or not living things came about by design or by accident. Their individual activities, from indeed coming about to continued goals of sustaining themselves, uncover the disputed goal-directedness or purpose. 
 This is one of the best Beatles picture books I have seen. Most of the pictures are previously unpublished.The postcard format of the pictures is really attractive. The 744 page book literally spans the entire Beatles career from 1963 to 1969. Highly recommended 
 A short and rewarding study, more remarkable as a defense of Art than an analysis of Proust, per se. While Deleuze has many knowing admirers,I have generally found his work difficult and conceptually self-indulgent, despite having some background in post-modernist Fr. thought. This book I found very "approachable" since the Proustian theme grounds Deleuze's discourse. There were still things I didn't understand but for all that, a fascinating commentary on aspects of Proust that is, moreover, perhaps , an excellent introduction to Deleuze. Now I must go back and again try his -- you name it. Not to mention a return to Proust 
 This is definitely one of the 2 best albums I own.  It is so relaxing that I cannot remember the last time I was able to listen to the whole album.  I have had it since 1989 and have worn out at least two copies on cassette.  The only thing better than this album is the video.  You do need to be careful when watching the video if you have vertigo, since Eagles Path is just like being there.  You can almost feel the wind in your hair 
 THE SHIPMENT WAS FAST AND IN GREAT SHAPE! WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR!! 
    John Farrell's brilliant new book is as thoroughgoing a critique of modernism as you will ever see. Farrell illustrates how we have given up on ourselves, and spent 400 years covering up our needless defeat.      The clear first chapter explains the outline of his thinking, the comparison of Gawain and the Green Knight with Don Quixote illustrates the nature of the problem, and from Martin Luther through Rousseau we see how modernism is played out. Now we are living with it.    This should be the book of the year for college faculties. It will not be as popular as Alan Bloom's "Closing of the American Mind," but it is more profound and good for the soul.        
 This book really opened my eyes to the conditions in which animals are being raised. Not only is it inhumane to the animals, but it is contaminating OUR food. It has many pictures, which I like, being a visual  person. Read this book and you will find it very educational 
 `Local Flavors' by leading vegetarian cookbook author and teacher, Deborah Madison is quite a bit different from her most famous and critically successful book, `Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone' which I consider a candidate for top ten positioning in anyone's list of cookbooks and easily near the top of your list of vegetarian cookbooks.  As quite loudly proclaimed by the subtitle, this book is really all about regional, seasonal, and organic produce from farmers' markets. As such, it is very close to Jack Bishop's book, `A Year in the Vegetarian Kitchen', as the primary organization of chapters is a cross between the seasons and types of vegetables. This is not quite as awkward as it may seem, as most members of a particular vegetable class, such as the cabbages and the onions typically come into season at about the same time. The book may be either more or less valuable than Bishop's book, depending on how close you live to either a Farmer's Market or a Community Supported Agriculture cooperative. If either is within an hour's drive, this book will be a great resource in making the best of these organizations.  Part of my modest reaction to this book is based on the fact that I live within 10 to 40 minutes drive of seven different permanent or semi-permanent `farmer's market' organizations, and I believe but three of those seven sites' produce comes primarily from things grown by the chap behind the table, or a close family member of the chap behind the table. And, it is precisely this direct contact with the farmer that Madison believes is so valuable to the Farmer's Market experience. Even with these seven locations, the only produce from all these sites together which is truly local is the corn, the apples, the strawberries, some peaches, and some of the tomatoes. Almost all the other produce comes from Florida, California, or South America, with some summer stone fruits from the Carolinas and Georgia. So, almost everything Madison explains about getting the most out of your Farmer's Market experience is wasted on me.  Madison's most important service in this book aside from the seasonally organized recipes is the clarification of what is the value of our patronizing Farmer's Markets. It is definitely not price. I strongly concur on this, as my local corn farmer's stand charges 50% more than my favorite megamart, in spite of the fact that the stand is a mere 35 yards from the cornfields. The real values are from acquiring exquisitely fresh produce (a REALLY big issue with corn and tomatoes) which is, if so advertised, free of artificial pesticides and free of treatment by herbicides or, with chickens, treatment with growth hormones or antibiotics. Additional values accrue from the fact that while the farmer gets about 9% of the sale of the produce at the megamart, they get 100% of the sale at a Farmer's Market, less the fee to rent the stand and the time required to truck in the goods and set up the stand at some ungodly hour of the morning.  The value is also not in the acquisition of the most attractive produce. I often thought that the poor looking produce at farm stands was due to the absence of artificial fertilizer and pesticides. It turns out that the real reason may be due to the fact that the farmer is selling things at the stands that may fall below the standards of his commercial distributors.  I think Madison's second most important contribution to her readers with this book is the advice to plan to stay a fair length of time at the market to get the lay of the land and talk to the vendors and to fellow customers. I really think this is a pretty good measure of how well the producers know their stuff. Nothing turns me off of a store faster than asking a question of a salesperson and they simply have no clue of what you speak, and volunteer no opportunity to speak to the store owner or some other potential expert. This is clearly a sign that this store is not a store or stand with which I want to do business. And, I am often surprised at how few merchants are aware of this fact. Within a block of one another there are three Italian delis in Little Italy in Manhattan with very similar wares. They even look a lot alike. Two are practically empty of customers. The third, DiPalo's, is crowded enough to require you to take a number when you enter the little store. This is because the DiPalo family members behind the counter really know what they are talking about and go out of their way to be sure you get what you want.  Getting back to the book, I will suggest that you take a by on this one unless you are within acceptable driving distance of a genuine Farmer's Market. Many of the recipes and subjects are covered in much greater detail in `Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone' and, when I went to actually make one of the recipes, I found a fairly serious lapse in the instructions which neglected to tell me how to prep an onion for the cooking. If I would have followed directions literally, I would have put an unpeeled onion in a pot of hot olive oil.  On the positive side, I give Ms. Madison good marks for covering eggs and cheese and poultry in addition to the veggies. The bibliography and sources are slanted toward Farmers' Markets, but there is still a fair overlap to `Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone'.  If you are close to a Farmer's Market and fully intend to spend time there OR if you are an inveterate foodie who must have every title by important cookbook authors, then buy this book.

 In these hurried and stressful times, we may forget the importance of slowing down and taking the time for self-care.   Cheryl Richardson, New York Times bestselling author of Life Makeovers and Take Time For Your Life, has a gorgeous 52-card deck dedicated to self-care.  These inspirational Self-Care Cards will challenge you to take a specific action to improve the quality of your life in some way. Whether you elminate clutter, clarify your priorities, take a leap of courage, or listen to your wise self, you'll experience the power of using small changes to make a big difference in your life.   Each of these vibrant, glossy cards brings a specific aspect of self-care into focus. For example, the PLAYFULNESS card shows a woman enrobed in purple with a sleeping child in the center. The back of this card says Play with a child. Children are your greatest teachers. When we're busy taking care of the bills and a household, one of the first things that seems to get sacrificed is a sense of playfulness. When I look at this card, I'm reminded that we all have an inner child within, and accessing a sense wonderment, curiosity and lightheartedness is one way we can take care of ourselves and neutralize strses.  On the card Time, a cherubic girl in a lavish gold dress looks at us, while gears, planets and stars swirl overhead. Beside her is a table bearing a hourglasss, which is surrounded by several clock faces. The back says Schedule a sacred date with yourself. You deserve time for your life.   Other self-care cards include SILENCE, RELAXATION, FAITH, RELEASE, CHOICE, GUIDANCE and OPPORTUNITY. You can draw a card a day to center in on a specific aspect of self-care, or even shuffle them and pick one when you'd like some insight and guidance into your life. With breath-taking art by Jean-Paul Avisse, Core Wolfe, and Shirley Ann--coupled with the wise words of life coach Cheryl Richardson--Self-Care Cards are a wonderful way to take the time to be mindful of your own needs and wishes.

 This was a gift for my husband and I don't believe I have seen so much nostril in my life, since, of course, his usage of the new nose hair trimmer 
 I liked the mini series. Acting is good. Scenery lovely. Costuming is superb. Gives the viewer a real feel for the place and time.  Unfortunately there are some things I don't care for. Both sides, if there's a character in one family there is another in the other just like that person. Some of the relationships are somewhat stale. The main villein is really two dimensional.   Both the southern main character and his northern counterpart fall in love with women socially unacceptable to their society. The northerner falls in love with and marries an irish catholic lass. The southerner falls in love with a girl who turns out to be the daughter of a harlot and an Octeroon (One african great grandparent). I would have prefurred something more open since history reveals there were quite a few gentle relationships between southern white  men and women of african decent which would spare the audience this soap opera stuff.     Great scenerey. Wonderful scenes. Wonderful authentic costuming. Just pathetic as sopa operas are. 
 Overton tells us in plain language how the working class and the poor are being eliminated from the political process. Interestingly, he is able to cast the old stories of poll taxes and lynchings in a 21st century surround-sound format. Using real-life examples from the lives of real people, Overton illustrates how certain people are stealing the country right from under our own noses.  I certainly believe the Supreme Court could have benefitted greatly from reading his "how to rig an election" chapter before deciding the recent Texas gerrymandering case. Spencer's point ... Voters should choose politicians, politicians should not be choosing the voters!!!!    His parallel of this country's voting system to the "matrix" is also quite brilliant. If some of the new restrictions that Overton warns us about takes place, we will need the powers of the Oracle, Neo, Morpheus, and Trinty just to be able to cast a vote (and more importantly make it count). If you are serious about voting rights or if you just want to be able to predict the outcomes of the 2006 mid term elections, this book is a must read. I highly recommend it to all audiences 
 Honeymooning in Hawaii was my new wife's idea and buying this guide was mine.  Both turned out to be perfect choices.  We stayed at the Mauna Kea which was expensive but we balanced it off by exploring the coast using this guide.  We felt very adventurous going down unpaved roads through lava fields and were rewarded with beautiful blue lagoons and expansive solitary beaches.  We only touched the surface of all the cool places they listed inside.  Until nextime Big Island . . . . 
 I say that because you will never hear this excellent gem of an album on commercial radio. Actually, radio has sucked since the late 80's. Since this is not a review of radio all I can say is follow amazon's reviews by fellow music lovers and trust them. Buy this album and then try Under The Covers with Suzanne Hoffs. And please turn off your radio as it is filled with what the music industry wants you to hear, not this great stuff 
 Neville Marriner's first recording of MESSIAH, recorded in 1976, is without a doubt his best recording of the work.  Marriner recorded Handel's most famous oratorio with his Academy of St. Martin in the Fields for Decca, and it is not to be confused with a later German language version from Munich for EMI, or a 1992 live concert (Philips) with soloists who were not on the level of the 1976 Decca recording.  Marriner takes generally fast, refreshing tempos in the choruses and keeps a light texture, but he knows where to slow down, and the Academy players are so good: in sync with Marriner's every nuance and tempo fluctuation (these are few, but sometimes the music calls for slight changes in tempo or expression.) "For unto us a Child is born" is the most satisfying I've heard, and it really moves, yet never seems rushed.  All the soloists are excellent, and really have an understanding of Handel's style of writing for the voice, the meaning of the text, drawn from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.  They are not operatic voices, but more attuned to the intimate side of late Baroque oratorio.  Keep in mind, though, intimate does not mean "namby pamby" or "wimpy."  The choruses are very hearty indeed, and the heft of the orchestra always appropriate in the big moments, yet never sacrificing grace for a big sound.  This is also a complete MESSIAH, and a bargain on 2 discs.  Ormandy and Bernstein (both Sony) are not complete, but really extended excerpts.  If you must have period instruments, try Hogwood/Academy of Ancient Music (L'Oiseau Lyre, 1980, with a boys/men's choir) or Gardiner/English Baroque soloists (Philips, 1982).  But Marriner in my mind is the best, as he blends both worlds: chamber choir and orchestra, but modern instruments.  Recorded sound is terrific: highest recommendation 
 On Upanishads: Excellent read, puts you new lines, way beyond your day to day thoughts.  Katha upanishad was the most interesting and captivating as I found the narration very good.  On the translation: Translating a centuries old document into English is a challenging task.  A word by word translation would be disastarous.  Search in the web for Upanishads and compare it with the translation by the author - Eknath.  Eknath Eswaran has done a wonderful job  On the commentary: Some of upanishads do not need any comments are they are very self-explanatory (thx to the excellent translation).  But some of the upanishads are very difficult to relate to, and probably needed more commentary.  
 If you have truely studied Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X then you have probably seen pictures of this book next to them on their desks. Don't think for one minute that you understand prejudice without reading  this book first. It explains why prejudice occurs and how it is part of our  basic makeup. Mr. Allport also explains how to change these perceptions  that generate the discrimination. For any Civil Rights Advocate this is a  must read. It puts you inside the mind of those who practice bigotry and  discrimination. If you cannot understand them then how can you defeat them 
 It was, in short, a film about sex and the way that human beings use sex as a refuge, a release, and a weapon... The frank dialog, the nudity, and the simulated sex were not gratuitously employed but were integral to the theme of the film, and if the picture was not totally successful, it was certainly unforgettable...   Marlon Brando appears as a middle-aged American--but not the kind of American in Paris glorified by either George Gershwin or Ernest Hemingway... This is a man tormented by inner conflict... Brando's Paul between self-hatred over his wife's suicide and his feelings for Maria Schneider's Jeanne, she between her adoring documentary filmmaker fiancé (based wittily on Godard) and the taboo-breaking Paul...  The stark, empty flat that is the lovers' retreat from conventional society, and the cold, windy pavement where Paul screams his loathing for the world against the din of a passing train--connects us with the mood of the film...   Eager to escape the oppressive walls of his dark life, Paul embarks on a very complete sexual experience with a willing young woman in which there is no history spoken, no promises of future liaisons, no ties of any kind with the outside...   The two lovers know nothing of each other, not even their names... Their affair is purely physical, and the barren apartment becomes, as Bertolucci intended, a world of debauchery on which is explored a catalog of behavior that seems more childish than kinky...  Jeanne is a child-woman... She asks what she should call Paul, and they proceed to give themselves names brought only out of grunts, growls and screeches... Paul's cruelty is not justified and perhaps this is what attracts the modish girl... Some scenes emotionally are so provocative that you experience a wide range of feelings... Paul never asks Jeanne a direct question, but is constantly framing her for his next experiment, besides he assaults her, humiliates her and pushes her over the edge... There is one great moment for the heroine when she refuses Paul's power play and is equally unimpressed by his new declarations of love... She insists: 'It's over!'   The film is beautifully shot... The cinematography is unique, somber, shadowy and painterly... It presents despair, and the music reinforce the despairing mood... The movie is also intensely erotic, intensely realistic, immensely disturbing... The extreme frankness makes faintly uncomfortable viewing, not only because of its sexual material but because of its exploration of our inner nature with true perspective... Hopefully, younger viewers can turn their minds back to a time when sex was mysterious and beautiful; dangerous and daring; not just easy and transitory... Sex nearly always implies intimacy, but doesn't always provide it...   'Last Tango in Paris' is one of the great explorations of cinema's visual possibilities... Bertolucci camera's movements throughout the film characterize the rights steps of the tango which the two main characters execute at the climax of the film... We feel swept away by the beauty of the tango despite the tragic quality of the acts and events it escorts... The film does prove Bertolucci to be a true filmmaker capable of the audacity of Jean-Luc Godard and the distinctive style of Ingmar Bergman...   
 All of the songs on this album are at least pretty good. On some, though, the lyrics are too precious while on others the lyrics are somewhat opaque and the music is not interesting enough to balance the preciousness or make me want to pay close enough attention to cut through the opacity. On some songs, though, everything comes together and the music and lyrics complement eachother perfectly. 'Kissing the Lipless' and 'Young Pilgrims' are excellent but the real highlight is 'Pink Bullets'. Bittersweet! 
 The Secrets of Facilitation is a great book for facilitators, from those about to facilitate their first session to those of us who have been practicing for over 25 years.  I counted over 200 Post-Its and notes in my copy.  Beyond what we facilitators gain, the "secret" of The Secrets is the value this book will have to those in Executive Suites and serving on Boards.    All leadership teams are searching for new leaps in productivity.  They are lean as can be, yet uncomfortably aware that the majority of ideas delivered by consultants (60%, 75%%, 90%+?) come from their own people.  They need an alternative. Their answer lies in the first secret revealed by Michael Wilkinson, "You can achieve more effective results when solutions are created, understood, and accepted by the people impacted."  The rest of the book reveals how to do so.  Now executives can choose to use in-house facilitators and their own people to develop and deliver the majority of solutions, and outside facilitators and top talent consultants only when truly needed.  Most executives I meet have experienced a session of the caliber delivered by a true Master Facilitator like Michael.  Many can recall exciting, highly successful sessions facilitated by a real professional.  What they've lacked is confidence that similar successes can be repeated consistently.  The Secrets of Facilitation reveals a set of skills that can be learned and can permeate any organization.  Michael's efforts in researching, teaching, and now writing this book will accelerate the adoption of facilitation as a core approach for leaders in any organization.  I only know Michael from participating in sessions he's facilitated, my recent association with the International Association of Facilitators, and through reputation of even some of my own favorite clients who recommend him as "The Best".  Even so, yes, I do have a bias for recommending Michael's book.  First, with the success of his book there will be more business for all facilitators.  Second, our own firm's focus is turning more towards facilitating virtual teams, where getting our clients to understand The Secrets becomes even more important!    Certainly if you can schedule Michael to facilitate a session, grab the opportunity, he is that good.  Better yet, buy copies of his book, give them out to your full leadership team, and embrace facilitation as a way of doing business.    John Carroll CEO Dynamic Directions, Inc. 
 As usual Rick Atkinsons' writing was complete, insightful and poinient. He brought out the questions and problem of an entire generation of soldiers. Anyone in the military during the mid-60's until the late-70's will find this book full of the same questions in our minds as those Mr. Atkinson has written about. I highly recommend this book to all 
 Abetted by his Aunt Nafisa, who he never knew existed, Ashraf el-Mansur comes to the Mediterranean port city of El Iskandryia having escaped from an American prison.  Lady Nafisa explains to her nephew that her brother married American Sally Welham and though divorced five days later, he is a legitimate offspring of an Emir.  Aunt Nafisa introduces Ashraf to her niece nine year old Hani and his future wife Zara daughter of wealth; both hate him because the fuss made over him interferes with their respective lives.  However, before his aunt can complete arrangements for his entrance into the elite of Ottoman society, she is killed.  As a newcomer and the sole heir to her fortune, the police suspect Ashraf murdered his aunt.  Based on his American experience with Chinese employers, Ashraf knows he must prove his innocence or be railroaded into prison or worse.  His only help comes from two females who loath him.  PASHAZADE is a fabulous futuristic amateur sleuth tale built on an alternate historical foundation to include Germany winning World War I and the Ottoman Empire thriving in the early twenty-first century.  The who-done-it is cleverly handled so that mystery buffs have a solid investigative tale with some intriguing police procedural elements.  The cast is terrific.  Ashraf also known as ZeeZee struggles with what he has learned about his patriarchal ancestry (his mother could not provide two consistent responses as her version of the truth kept wavering) and with his aunt's death.  Hani and Zara add depth to Ashraf's character.  However, the star is the city of El Iskandryia where fundamentalist Islamic and western hedonists share a troubled past and shop at Wal-Mart.

 ...by the collected works of Brazilian author Paulo Coelho. He seems to have hit a certain note in his writings that promises to ring true forevermore. His is not a linear style, folks. ELEVEN MINUTES: A NOVEL is not a formulaic novel of "first this happens, then that happens, then something else happens." You can jump into any part of this story and basically live life at its finest. Life at its most complex and inscrutable and pleasurable--the pleasure within the deep pain, do you know what I'm talking about? Coelho writes his meandering tale as the game of life itself generally occurs: it has twists, stops, starts, and all sorts of gaps in between. Things don't stop when they're supposed to stop. Things don't start where they're supposed to start. And matters also don't proceed according to plan. Rarely will you notice that what is supposed to happen, happens. Here's a good analogy: think of how your mind works at the best of times, how it assaults you with mile-a-minute calculations and considerations. Imagine how you run your typical day, and the process via which you go about making decisions.  It's never a straightforward process, is it?  One moment you can be lolling in the doldrums, without a clue, then something can smack you in the face and make you wonder just how deeply you'd managed to slip into that funk of yours, feeling sorry for yourself, imagining where you can take the first exit to Check-Out-of-Life Land, buying yourself a one-way express train ticket to hell...then you suddenly realize it was all a Grand Test, papito. That there was more to it, and the Great One, Whomever It May Be For You, was merely pressing your corporeal buttons, wanting to see how much you can take. To basically see what you're made of. To see if you can walk the walk as well as you tell your friends how godfearing and believing of a person you really are.  There were some of the thoughts that were racing through my mind, Indy500-style, as I blew through page after excellently-translated (from the Portuguese) page of Coelho's latest installment.  Coelho's example in life further indicates to me that some of the best scribes and novellists on this planet are the ones who have stared the face of Hell dead in the eyes, and have lived to tell the tale. The ones who have managed to face down their most dastardly demons, and who have the scars, the tattoos, the breast implants, the Botox, the piercings, and the expensive quick-fixes to show it. Not to mention the thousand and one lovers (paid or otherwise). The ones who have dared to "go there," against all the odds and conventional wisdom...who'd one day decided to cast their lot in with the Fates, not caring for that one very moment whether or not they lived or died or say the next bowl of weeties in the morning.  Because it's there, on the cusp of such indecision, where the fruits of the vine can be deliciously picked. It's there, where you can feel the gusts of hot backwind gushing up from the abyss, drawing you downward with their complex convenction currents, that you--so mortal and so very afraid--are unable to resist its powerful yank, Frank.  Know this, my dear readers...some of the best (and therefore the most successful people, from a lifestyle standpoint, which also generally equates to the "game of life" standpoint) in the world are the one who've faced down such adversity. I'm not surprised that someone like Maria was able to overcome her fears, and overcome her provincial inner-jungle background to achieve the very best of what there was in life in a land where people from the outside are shunned with as much love as a bout of the stomach flu. I believe this is also the dream of many city dwellers, those who were born and raised in large metropolises, to be able to come to the aid of their families...it's a romantic notion indeed. I salute people like Maria.  In fact, the best experience is the one you engage in and create all by yourself, not the one which is handed down to you third-hand. Those are the people we drool over, the ones who populate the pages of some of our best novels, the ones who form the bases of our most memorable fictional characters, the ones who cause films and books to climb to the tops of the bestseller charts.  But where do these people come from? I say to you, friends, that they breathe and live. They TRULY exist.  Rolf is also quite true to form. In our age of rapid advancement, with cheaper airfares, plentiful business opportunities to deceive and be deceived, massive advances in technology which continue to set us apart from one another, the fact that someone can become burned out with life at such an early age (in their 30s) is really possible. Godhonest. That Rolf is looking out for something totally different, and that he finds his passion and solace in Maria...someone so lambasted by the mainstream and the System...we shouldn't be in the least bit alarmed. Artists go looking for their daily inspiration (which for them is their daily bread) in all the so-called darkly mysterious places. They go digging into the muck to pull out the pearls, and sometimes the muck is more than six-feet deep, the metaphor being a significant one, Jack.  I'm sure any one of us who have enjoyed this particular novel have met more than our fair share of Rolfs over this lifetime, have we not? If you haven't, then it's coming, toots. When you meet your potential Rolf, please don't judge him too harshly...  In all--and as I haven't read the other reviews on this site, though I'm sure they're all, for the most part, complimentary to the author (and rightfully so)--I'd have to say that each and every one of us is going to derive something different from our reads. We're going to zero in on the thing which pulled most stridently at our heartstrings, and overemphasize, perhaps, that which others might find somewhat trivial. I can give you examples, but you've got other books to read, have you not?  No matter.  There's enough inside the pages of this book to tease and tickle almost any human...regardless of gender, regardless of nationality.  Coelho does it again, and in this way I feel that he's truly gifted with something that he was born to do. It's such a sweet sensation reading a piece of literature which rolls off the fingertips of the greats.  I can't wait for his next cut.  Hand on the heart, ADM from Prague 
 It is indeed a pity to realize that this marvelous book is now out of print along with its companion CDs. The thoughtfulness and work that this team of scientists put into preserving a "collective voice" in words, pictures, and music of the human species is remarkable. The Voyager Interstellar Record is affixed to one the Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977. The record is attached to the craft in the hopes that -- after its already successful mission of having photographed the inner and outer solar system -- it might have even a remote chance of being intercepted thousands of years in the future by whatever extraterrestrials there may be, if any exist at all. The hope is that "they" might find it and learn something about us long after we are gone. The book is a meticulous description of every stage of putting the record together. I have found the book in libraries and have acquired the CDs through an inter-library loan. But the fact that both the book and CDs are no longer in print, and therefore less available to the public, is a huge shame. I highly recommend this book as a purchase for either an individual or a library. It is a testament both to the scientists who put it together, and to the recognition and preservation of human achievement. Curiously, this was done before the invention of the Compact Disc. An Interstellar "Disc" should be done in the future 
 A quote from Buss which appeared in the New York Times brought me to his book. I've spent years doing divorce work as an attorney. I also spent a considerable amount of my own time studying the elements and mechanics of relationships. This text and the research behind it helped explain many unanswered questions. Thank you for a work well done.

 Hell's Angels is an all-time enduring classic by the late "Gonzo" journalist Hunter S. Thompson. It is a very interactive, very detailed description of one's affiliation with the dreaded motorcycle outlaws known as the Hell's Angels. The writing style is quite fascinating, for if it were not based on actual accounts or the interpretations thereof, it would be a most fascinating series of pulp fiction stories.  The group, Hell's Angels, is described as a group of unhygienic individuals who have no particular goals in life and who know that the roads they travel will lead to no success. They are highlighted as those who know that they are in financial and social oblivion and that their situations are only going to get worse. They are characterized, with the exception of a rare few, as uneducated bums with no purpose in the long run and who choose to live for the moment by going to bars, drinking heavily, engaging in unspeakable sexual acts, and torturing those who "get in their way" psychologically, physically and sexually.  An intermittent account of how the Hell's Angels, especially the lower-ranking members, are portrayed is laden with paradoxes. Comparisons are drawn between their physical attributes and those of the bikes they ride. On the one hand, the Angels are the sloppiest individuals of the worst kind, yet their bikes are lovely, well-maintenanced machines of thoroughly polished chrome and steel. In one recollection, Thompson mentioned that when off their bikes, they appeared as clueless, spastic, inane and inarticulate dolts, but when they got on their bikes, they became transformed into something quite the opposite, which entitled them to being Kings of the Road. For the clumsiness on foot would be more than compensated for by masterful uses of their motorcycles, including an indescribable ability to skillfully and gracefully go around highly dangerous curves at 120 mph. It is at that point that the reader comes to realize that if he/she were on a California highway in the mid-1960's, especially any of those near Oakland or Berdoo, no one messes with the Angels.  The paragraphs above shed light on the Angels in very notorious ways, and rightfully so. Indeed, the Angels could be quite a perplexing group. Despite the nihilistic tendencies of its several members, the Angels consisted of chapters throughout California and various parts all over the U.S. For these multi-faceted groups to be formed and maintained, the presidents had to be highly systematic, highly organized individuals. Hunter Thompson mentioned the Grand Poo-Bah of these chapters, namely Sonny Barger, who primarily ran the Oakland chapter and was a very astute and intelligent individual much attuned to the activities of and policies enacted in California law so as to know that, in order to reduce, if not eradicate, dealings with police and patrolmen, there was a time and place for Angels' "activities" as well as that for "no Angels around".  Even included are unusual accounts where owners whose stores were along highways the Angels would frequent would be intimidated by the Angels and relinquish their businesses to the bikers for a few hours, only to return and find that nothing was stolen and that the shops were in even better shape than they were before the Angels arrived. Not only did Thompson record accounts that some of the Angels could be good storekeepers for the moment, he also made note that after some of their excursions, they would actually leave behind money on the counter for purchases of beer.  Psychologically complex and dysfunctional, yet functional, could the Angels have ever been during Thompson's adventures with them. Thompson acknowledged that the Angels were to be regarded as hippies but not in the fashion attributed to the anti-Vietnam War demonstrators. In fact, Thompson mentioned that by-and-large the Angels did not like this latter bunch. Interestingly enough, Thompson pointed out that the groups were physically similar but were ideologically dissimilar; what was the present (the mid-1960's) was the only tie that would bind these groups. To sum it up, Thompson would cite the peace demonstrators as those who turned against the values instilled by previous generations and were "rebelling against the past", while the Angels, without the education and marketable skills to thrive in a developing, technologically-driven U.S. market, were "rebelling against the future".  All in all, Thompson had his share of interesting experiences. I will not get into the juicy details, but one might as well receive the message that if you were to deal with people like the 1960's Hell's Angels and wanted to survive, you might as well put philosophical themes of ethics on hold, unless if they are equipped with the rationality needed for self-preservation. I conclude with portions of a paragraph regarding the nature of the Hell's Angels: "Despite everything psychiatrists and Freudian castrators have to say about the Angels, they are tough, mean and potentially dangerous as packs of wild boar. The moment a fight begins, any leather fetishes or inadequacy feelings are entirely beside the point, as anyone who has ever tangled with them will sadly testify...[Y]our chances of emerging unmaimed depends on the number of heavy handed allies you can muster in the time it takes to smash a beer bottle. In this league, sportsmanship is for old liberals and young fools. 
 I bought this book yesterday morning and began reading it on my subway ride home.  The people around me probably thought I was crazy because I could not stop laughing.  It was so good that all I did the whole day was read it (even though it's the size of a college text book).  The book is funny, filled with great ideas, and definitely worth the money.  A great gift for anyone who likes to throw parties or cook 
 THE LOST OF ART LISTENING was a book that I read in my college Listening class. The book has a lot of helpful advice and good ideas that if incorporated into people's lives will help them become better listeners. Basically, the book's overall theme is that listening takes work and if we're going to be better listeners, we have to be willing to actually take time to hear people out and understand what they are saying to us, without worrying about what we are going to say next. Though I think the book is worthwhile reading, it is rather repetitive and the author unneedingly repeats himself over and over. Also, though some parts of the book are based off of research and years of experience in counseling, some of the ideas are just the author's own thoughts and opinions and shouldn't be taken for complete truth.  Overall, THE LOST ART OF LISTENING is a good book that can help one find the lost art and bring it into one's life 
 I'll admit I really don't like much of today's country music but Gary Allan has always been the exception.  His music is always gritty and soulful and the lyrics aren't always polished for "tender" radio play.  I've always been a fan of Gary Allan and this one is by far my favorite.  I read that this CD was therapy for Gary after the loss of his wife and personally, this CD has been my therapy as well.  It's helped me come to grips with the loss of a special little girl who thought of me as her uncle.  At my lowest, the song "Life Ain't Always Beautiful" has been the only thing that kept my afloat.  It will become a classic hopefully.  Tremendous work from the most talented man in the young country circles.  
 The best thing I took away from this book is the idea that life actions are much more powerful and effective when they stem from beliefs that you 'have' things rather than from beliefs that you 'want' things. Reaching nirvana is all about believing you already have it.  This book helped me figure out how to spend about 12 hours total over a few days in a heightened state of contented 'having'. It's only fair; the lessons do take commitment from the reader to achieve extended periods of contentedness. Mileage may vary. ;-)  I know I can go back to the book and get there again; it's a pretty good roadmap 
 You think that the children will be better off now that they are in an orphanage. But beware... it only gets worse for the childen that you have learned to care about... thanks to Snicket's great story telling abilities. 
 Today I received the first issue - April 2006 issue. I found it AMAZING and INFORMATIVE resource for body, mind and soul practices toward healthier life..  The most thing I liked about this magazine is that it respects religions. It provides accurate information from various religions to help people of other believes improve their lives. (Relying to what I read until now in this issue

 This is an excellent biography of John Wesley Powell--exlorer, geologist, scientist, writer, and politician.   Anyone who reads this is sure to increase the amount they know about this historic figure, and about the West in general as the stories of each are inextricably tangled.  The book excels at its account of John Wesley Powell's life AFTER his famous trips down the Colorado River, and does a great job of describing Powell's role in the battle against over-populating the West.   If the book has faults though, they lie in that many of Stegner's sources have since been expounded upon or dismissed entirely, and so the facts in this book aren't entirely current.  Also, Stegner dismisses too quickly the merits of the story of James White, a man who very possibly went down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon two years before Powell did. And, it's kind of ridiculous how Stegner criticizes Powell's second expedition's photos as if they were famous works and art: This photo "is marred by too much nondescipt low-water beach in the foreground," and that sort of thing. This is a great book for anyone interested in John Wesley Powell or the Colorado River.  It's possibly Stegner's best nonfiction work, though "Mormon Country" is good as well.   For another great account of John Wesley Powell, read "Down the Great Unknown" by Edward Dolnick. Or, for a half-decent book about Wallace Stegner's peculiarly white view of the American West, read, "'Why I Can't Read Wallace Stegner' and Other Essays" by Elizabeth Cook-Lynn.  That one's kind of interesting.   
 Advanced and practical information on magick, the occult, metaphysics andvisualization. Very well written and easy to do for either the novice orthe advanced student. The author put much effort and caring into writingthis wonderful book. Highly recommended 
 Botti phrases like an accomplished singer.  The melodies are mellow and sound effortless.  Relaxing, romantic and beautiful. I've listened to it over and over 
 Okay,I admit that I didn't really know much about the Israel-Palestine conflict...that is, until I read Jeffrey Goldberg's insightful memoir. Goldberg really explained the roots of the conflict, and how difficult it is to solve. And yet, he offers a bright vision of the future. It is such a good book, I will be reading it again 
 Genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear! An excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather, well worth the money spent. 
 The author himself is renowned in math circles for his various achievements like gold medals at IMO ! and 4 times Putnam fellow !  No wonder this book is such beautiful rarety. I was totally impressed by the handling of the topics and the problem-solving approaches the author has  chosen to explain. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in  accelerating his knowledge in maths for a competitive exam like ARML, USMO.  IMO etc. Definitely not for fire-side reading so it aint worth your time if  you have only casual interest in maths. This book is intended for serious  kids.I'd given it 10 stars for such marvelous insight 
 Beautiful canister.  I purchased one in each of the three sizes.  They look fantastic in my kitchen.  Highly recommend 
 The Body in the Library is an entertaining and easy to read book. Near the end the book rushes to finish as Miss Marple starts jumping to conclusions without sharing most of her insights until the coda chapter. But it's still a fun read 
 Warning: THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER CAPERCAILLIE CD!!!  This is, interestingly enough, the first one I bought, and it's wonderful; it managed to get me hooked on the band.  But as a compilation of soundtracks, many of the tracks are short, transitional music; many are instrumental.  The vocalised songs are nice, but showcase merely Karen's beautiful voice, not necessarily her magnificent talent.  It's a wonderful addition to a complete Capercaillie collection, but not necessarily representative of the band's other offerings 
 This book by Vicente Wolf has inspired me, as an interior design educator, to further my design research and development of my photographic skills. I have always admired his interiors published in various magazines. This book, however, has become the inspiration I use with my students. It has energized my own approach to design with a much more sensitive eye for detail, and has inspired my very soul. His photos are beautiful. His sensitivity to culture and the "crossing of boundaries" in his travels has encouraged me to be more aware when I am traveling. Thanks to Vicente Wolf, my design life has changed 
 but this is really worth reading if you really want to master c++. not terribly easy reading though.. 
 I was happy to see that the DFA released these on a compilation.  I don't think they've released a bad mix yet.  It starts off with Far From Home, which for some reason, reminds me of flying off into space for 10 minutes.  The mix of Shake Your Coconuts manages to make shrieking feedback fit in with Junior Senior.  The mix of Colours is probably the least "DFA-like", and isn't at all danceable, but highly listenable.  She Wants to Move is an excellent take on this, complete with Nintendo-like sounds.  The deep disco groove on The Hand That Feeds is a big surprise, as you wouldn't think Nine Inch Nails could be made this grooved-out (although Reznor's vocals sounds really hoarse when the production's taken away).  The mix of Slide In is fantastic, with a great bass-and-horns line, and excellent use of Alison Goldfrapp's vocals.  The mix of Destination Overdrive is about 5 minutes of danceable noise, and while not bad, isn't particularly memorable.  Last is the mix of In A State, which starts off melancholy, and works it's way into a darker track, and serves as a great way to end the album.  If you like the DFA, you were probably going to get it anyway, but this makes a great pickup for anyone 
 This book provides an excellent overview of Christianity and what it means to be a Christian.  Those who are seeking direction in their lives will find an easy-to-understand, no-nonsense approach to Christianity and what it's all about.  Those already in the faith will find this resource to be a good check-up on where they stand in their faith, helping them to stay focused on the essentials and not get too caught up in non-essentials.  Rich's wit and light, easy style make this book a delight to read and one you'll want to share with family and friends 
 What can I say, except that I absolutely adore this man's music and this particular recording consists of his most beautiful compositions and re-recorded specifically for this one recording. I have played this CD even  more than my other John Barry recordings (which is quite a few). Anyone who  adores and respects this brilliant composer as I do will love this CD!  Mr.  Barry even included 2 compositions never heard before, which are simply  beautiful. I've been a fan of this man's for many, many years & I  usually buy his soundtracks even if I've never even seen the film, as he's  never disappointed me yet!  To me, there is no other soundtrack composer  like John Barry. For those not familiar with his work, this particular CD  would be the one I'd recommend for your first purchase -- you'll be hooked  and want to purchase every soundtrack the man has done.  Thank you, John  Barry 
 LEON RUSSELL AND THE SHELTER PEOPLE is tied with LEON RUSSELL and RETROSPECTIVE for Leon Russell's best album. This CD is a slab of pure, unadulterated Great Plains rock, with a strong gospel flavor. The fact that Russell currently advocates sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, makes LEON RUSSELL AND THE SHELTER PEOPLE an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience 
 I love books about animals.  Love all the little trivia.  Susan is an excellent, engaging writer - nothing boring or pompous about her style.  If I could have another sister, I'd sure pick her.  Obviously, she is strong, independant, positive, caring and her own woman who appears to be hugely happy in living a GOOD LIFE.  Most of all, loved her crazy little footnotes - uplifting and silly - and sometimes passages in the book also shared this humor.  I get tired of stodgy, know-it-all types and Susan surely ISN'T one.  She doesn't come across as the snotty "expert". That is appreciated!  The only downside for me was in not knowing a portion of the animals she was writing about.  Some were pretty obscure for this gal from Kenosha, WI.  Great job to Susan.  You're a credit to YOUR species 
 If you're illiterate about this theme, learn easy, and pick up a new point  of view - better say many points. And a new way of thinking too. If you're  a knower play with these models, join the established community for more  answers, and apply these models to real situations. A very helpful mate for  think tanks, marketing execs as me, engineers, biologists, and anybody who  need new responses for old problems. A funny, serious, and very very  illustrative reading in few pages! 
 Needed a fast AA charger to charge up NiMH batteries for my camera's flash unit, and did a bit of shopping and research.  Found this unit and decided to give it a try.  Comes with 6 AA's and 2 AAA's, so they get you started right off with a few batteries to use, which is nice.  Unpacked everything (the plastic package is difficult to open up, so be careful) and plugged it in.  There is a cooling fan built in which moves air across the batteries during charging, so just make sure you don't rest the charger where the airflow is blocked (e.g. on carpet).  Within the stated 15 minutes, the batteries were done and tested out at 1.2 volts on my voltmeter.  Put the batteries in my flash and took several dozen pictures that night without any problems.  Have yet to really give them an extreme durability test, but overall seems like it's working fine so far.  Some additional comments - if you're looking to buy this charger to charge existing NiMH batteries you may already own, be aware that the charger has some "intelligence" - that is, if the battery is "bad", the charger will not charge these batteries.  The light will turn on, then start flashing indicating that there is a problem and that the batteries are not charging.  Out of 4 existing older NiMH batteries I own, only 2 of them can be charged by this charger.  I suspect that brand new batteries will not have this problem.  It charged my old batteries also within 15 minutes, and these old batts tested out at 1.2 volts again with my voltmeter.  Based on this trial, it does not appear that you need to use IC3 batteries to get ~15 minute charge times.  The package does not indicate this requirement, either.  I did note that other competing chargers on the market will only give you 15 min charge times if you use special IC3 batteries.  Non-IC3 batts supposedly give you 30+ min charge times.  Not so with this charger, in my experience so far.  Nowhere on the package does it tell you what input voltages the charger supports, so I flipped it over and read the label on the unit.  It requires 100 to 120 volt input, so if you plan on using this overseas, you should bring along a voltage converter with you.  US voltage input only.  The unit is a little bulky, so if you are going on vacation, you'll probably have to pack it in your luggage, not in your camera case (my existing 14 hour overnight charger is small enough to be toted in my camera case today).  It comes with a cable to plug into a wall socket or an adapter for car use.  The instructions do say that if you charge batteries from a car, it will take longer than 15 minutes.  I have not tried this yet and don't know exactly how long it will take.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase and would recommend this unit to anyone looking to turn AA charge times around quickly, particularly any professional photographers who use these in their external flash units 
 there are some great songs and some terrible songs from Ludacris but overall it is pretty good. there are some songs like "Whats your fantasy" and "Southern Hospitality". It has great production from Chaka Zulu. Ludacris isn't a great lyricist but knows some good comedy 
 Have had the camera a short time and have grown to love its features and capabilities. Do purchase the 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens; for the price it is a nice lens.  I tried the image stabilizer by shooting a picture of the air conditioner on my neighbor's roof using 200 mm telephoto.  When you enlarge the image you can read the label for the brand name!  Without the image stabilizer, it is a blur.  I did the same for a book about 100 ft away and using 200 mm setting. Without image stabilizer the title is blurred; with the image stabilizer it is sharp. A very nice feature is you can take an image and then enlarge a portion of it and save, or use filters to make them BW, soft, more bright, or with different color tones.    People report that under tungsten light the auto setting gives a yellow tone without flash.  This is true.  However, you can use the P mode, which is like an auto mode, reset white balance easily to tungsten light and the picture comes out nice!.  Great low light capabilities with image stabilizer.  If you are into action photography, this may not be the camera for you.  It has limited ability to store a sequence of photos without a delay.  Other camers react faster and have larger capacity.    Do reset default from bright to natural tone.  You can do this in some modes, but not all.  Read the manual, it really will empower you with many nice capabilities.  Newer lenses are light and small and interface with image stabilization system automatically 
 While this book might not appeal to one looking for a more serious approach to Buddhism, Mr. Metcalf always conveys the information in a profound, simple, moving, insightful, witting, and fascinating way.  His aim in writing the book was to enable to reader to discover his or her own inner Buddha, to get more in touch with it, and to ultimately be guided through life by it.  Essentially, one must become one's own teacher.  The questions range from profound ones such as "What would Buddha do when doubting his spiritual path?" and "What would Buddha do when doctrine and reason collide?," to ones everyone has, such as "What would Buddha do about adultery?" and "What would Buddha do when feeling frustrated?," and to modern-day issues such as "What would Buddha do if his credit cards are maxed out?" and "What would Buddha do about road rage?"  Whatever one's problem or question, the answer is sure to be found here, along with some issues that perhaps one hadn't thought of before.  The quotes, lessons, and stories that start off each of the 101 answers are mostly drawn from traditional classic Buddhist texts such as the Dhammapada, the Buddhacharita, and the Sutta Nipata.  The advice is short but sweet, always making it seem relevant for the modern reader instead of very heavily theological or the product of another time.  Along the way the reader learns some fascinating things about Buddha himself, such as how he taught that one can completely follow all of his teachings from within any religion and need not be a Buddhist to do so, that he was a feminist (long before it had a name), that he was an environmentalist, that he was anti-war, that he endorsed what we today call interventions for those who are abusing substances or exhibiting troubling behavior, and that he attained enlightenment shortly after he stopped his intense fasting and began to love himself and his body again.  Far from coming across like some serious old man who was a recluse and only thinking of matters spiritual, he comes across as a vibrant person who'd seem right at home in the modern era, what with all of his downright liberal beliefs.  This is a book like the Tao Te Ching or the Dhammapada, that doesn't have to be read cover to cover or all at once.  One can go to whatever part of it one needs when one needs it, or can just open to a random page or pages for spiritual help with a pressing problem.  The publishing company will also give one a WWBD bracelet if one writes to them and sends a small fee, in response to the popularity of the WWJD bracelets.  How awesome is that? 
 This is an excellent vocabulary book which will help all the way through high school. Although dull, I would highly reccommend this book to any eighth or ninth grader who plans to excel in their high school year 
 Instead of discussing how super hedge funds like those operated by Buffet, Soros, Tudor profit big, it is dedicated to uncommon means/stratgies (I cant agree with the author that 1) the ideas were new, 2) his adoption of the term hedge fund to simply all funds covered) including PIPE (private investment in public equities, reverse merger, IPOs - SPAC (the speciality acquisitions corp), Dutch (IPO) Auctions, closed end fund arbritrage, following Billionaires' micro-cap portfolio, activism, stocks just kicked out from indexes for "seasonal" factors, coins, paintings, NY taxi medallions and even delinquent credit card debt etc etc. Okay as a supplementary reading for ideas, but definitely not to be taken as a main course. For those who wanna read to learn more on hedge fund, "Hedgehogging" by Barton Biggs (2006) is a much suitable choice.   For those who have not read the author's first book "Trade like a Hedge Fund: 20 Successful Uncorrelated Strategies & Techniques to Winning Profits" yet, I strongly recommend you to read that first. Your liking of that is a strong indicator of your preference to this. In case you dislike that one, please give this a pass. 
 Although I don't have this collection, this collection is a must have if  you have "12 Greatest Hits" in your collection, but if you have  "Patsy Cline Story," I'd recommend "A Portrait of Patsy  Cline," which has some of the same songs as this collection.  Her  interpretations of standards are very well her own and because of her  voice, they are made like they were just written for her to begin with.   Lots of her interpretations of standards such as "Heartaches,"  "Always," "I Love You So Much It Hurts," "Half As  Much," "Crazy Arms," and "Have You Ever Been  Lonely."  Minor charted hits such as "When I Get Thru With  You," and "He Called Me Baby," are also included.  As I said  before but I'll say again, this is a must have if you have "12  Greatest Hits" but want more and not for those with "Patsy Cline  Story" and want more as there is "A Portrait of Patsy Cline"  that serves the same purpose for those with "Story.&quot 
 At last the real reason we went from Bauhaus to barnyard virtually overnight.  Should be required reading for everyone over 35.  In a free society it is OK to be looney, but obligatory to know why 
 Any book or author that introduces a concept that becomes part of everyone's handicapping arsenal deserves recognition for their genius.  Davidowitz was the first to really publish insights into track bias and it's power.  Other than that concept, this book is full of good ideas across the board.  The revised edition's treatment of pace is good stuff even for those who approach pace more technically like Brohammer.  Davidowitz's work on charts and how to use them to find key races and trip overlays is more gold for serious players. Years after I first read this, I have realized how great this book is for horseplayers.  Davidowitz has covered a difficult array of factors with provoking insight into each and has done a masterful job of explaining how to incoporate into the handicapping puzzle.  
 Syd Field is absolutely, without a doubt the best!  In this book, he lets us know why Hollywood chooses one script over another.  After years of perfecting your craft, you really deserve to know what Syd does.  I thought I knew, but boy was I wrong!  Syd, however, showed me the way.  This is the  best book on selling a screenplay ever written.  Buy Screenplay and learn  your craft.  Then buy Selling a Screenplay and you'll be well on your way  to success.  My students are 
 "Stare. It is the way to educate your eye, and more. Stare, pry, listen, eavesdrop. Die knowing something. You are not here long." -- Walker Evans, c. 1960, from the afterword.  Thank God for Jeff L. Rosenheim, associate curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Due to his prodigious efforts, no less than five volumes of Walker Evans' best work -- much of it neglected, or previously unpublished -- have been published under Rosenheim's editorship in a little over a decade. The most notable of these have been: A thorough omnibus of Evans's photographs, with essays by current critics and scholars published by the Metropolitan; a collection of Evans' writings, translations and correspondence, and; a collection of Evans' Polaroid photographs, which he produced in the early 1970s, shortly before his death in 1975.  "Many Are Called" is the first book Rosenheim edited that is a reissue of a previously released book. Originally released in 1966, this collection of 89 photographs taken by Evans in New York City's subways between 1938 and 1941 marks the return of this seminal work in its entirety after many decades out of print.  Along with James Agee's original introduction is a newly written preface by Luc Sante, which basically says in more updated and professorial language what Agee said.  Rosenheim penned an afterword for this new edition, which relates the history of this work's genesis and its quarter-century dormancy before its first publication in 1966.  New plates have been engraved from scans made from Walker Evans' original negatives. They are attractively printed in duotone. Although the printing is considerably better in tonality than the original, halftone screening and slight pixilization resultant from digital scanning is evident to the careful eye.  Many readers will already be familiar with many of the plates herein, published in previous collections such as the one cited above and also prominently featured in Gilles Mora's "Walker Evans: The Hungry Eye."   Upon first seeing these photographs, I was struck by how these were a departure from Evans' earlier work, most notably his "American Photographs." Because of its surreptitious nature (Evans kept a Contax folding camera hidden in his overcoat), the look of his subway portraits is stripped down to its bare elements: Slightly out of focus, grainy because it was in 35mm rather than large format, and somewhat off-kilter framing (Evans never looked through a viewfinder, using a cable release hidden up his sleeve to trip the shutter). Many subway riders have been framed in a subtle halo of light, resulting from the naked incandescent bulbs in train stations refracting through the camera's lens, accidentally giving his subjects an angelic aura.  Yet, because of this anonymous shooting method, Evans was able to keep capture his subjects totally unawares. To Evans, this represented portraiture in its purest, unadulterated and totally ingenuous state. Because of their anonymity, his subjects have been unmasked, and are simply in transit between work and home, on their way to the movies, reading the paper in their hands (always a tabloid, never a gatefold -- fitting, for the tabloid was invented to accomodate the confines of the packed subway car). Some were caught staring up. (At toothpaste ads? At a pretty girl's lithe arm hanging from an overhead strap? Who knows?)  My favorite print is probably the most famous, of a comely Jewish girl, magazine in hand, her head topped by a hat's wide, round, brim, her shoulders elegantly wrapped in a voluminous fur.  Others, though, are more comical, iconic or ironic: Plate 5 shows an older gentleman, grimacing, his eye's closed; a pair of old ladies gab in profile (plate 27); a blue collar guy gets caught up, ethusiastically reading his Daily Mirror (31); a prim and properly dressed elderly woman finds something on the train quite un-prim and improper to laugh out loud at (34); a man yawns, his mouth wide open (44); a pin-up girl on the Chesterfield cigarette placard slyly peers over a sailor's shoulder, betraying him as more lonely than alone (83); an accordion player ambles between the rows of passengers, singing his song, his eyes closed and oblivious to the passengers' aloofness (89).  In 2002, the great landscape photographer Ansel Adams had his birthday celebrated from beyond his grave by all sorts of his hangers-on, the usual crowds from the Sierra Club, the Yosemite workshops and PBS. It was a fitting tribute, a larger-than-life gushing forth of accolades and genuflection that would have pleased the professional publicity seeking cameraman.  The next year, however, marked the centenary of another great photographer, Walker Evans. Yet, there was little fanfare. This was also quite fitting, in its own way. Nonetheless, this quiet and fastidious man has probably had an influence greater than any other on the photography of the past 50 years.  In contrast to the bigger-than-a-breadbox boxed edition of "Ansel Adams at 100," there was no "Walker Evans at 100" released in 2003. However, this belated volume is a most fitting volume to the greatest photographic collector of prosaic American ephemera. In 89 plates, Evans created a revolution in documentary photography. Seeking not to convince, interpret, preach or incite. Rather, he  achieves that rarest and most precious of photographic aspirations: He permits the world to simply see the world as he has seen it through his own eyes.   There's nothing necessarily novel about that in itself. Yet, what makes this work so singular and powerful is that we not only see through Evans' eyes, we like what we see, are moved by it and what we've seen is indelibly imprinted within our minds' eyes.  Anybody can make such miracles of nature as Momument Valley, the Grand Tetons or Half-dome at Yosemite beautiful. Walker Evans, though, took the ordinary and common, and raised it to something unique and profound through his taste, imagination and artistic passion 
 I honestly wasn't expecting too much from this book when I originally looked at it. I was expecting the caliber of the not-so-"Complete" series... Boy, did that get shot in the foot. This is probably one of the best supplements released in the past three years. It's very comprehensive with very little useless, extraneous information and is organized well. The sections written to be helpful to the DM are actually helpful to the DM- not just a bunch of 'no duh,' common sense information like many of the other new supplements. The new classes are actually interesting- not merely spinoffs or mixes of other classes, and the Taint tables offer a really interesting new idea. The new creatures are also very intriguing, again, not just spinoffs. Take the Grey Jester: a humanoid that basically eats the laughter and happiness out of peoples (and PCs) to create mindless drones to do its bidding. There is also a little speckling of possible mini-adventures that help you get an idea of how to employ the concepts introduced into a campaign. While the book is really designed for a horror-oriented campaign, it would be very easy to adapt some of these ideas into a brief adventure, even just one dungeon. Pages and pages aren't wasted on new magic items or overly extensive info on adaptation into Ebberon, Faerun, etc. There's just the right about of info on both.  It would be worth the money for a one-shot Halloween adventure. It's very original, very creative, and a great buy. It would be a perfect match for anyone intending to run a Ravenloft campaign 
 I love granola and cereal in general, but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had. The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love, and which is on the back of every bag: "we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce." Although I do eat processed food, I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods, and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste.  Like most granola, it is high in calories and fat, but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil), and it has no trans fat, and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. This cereal is softer than most granola, though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed, for optimal nutritional and digestive health.   The six-pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive), so as a value proposition, I think this is not only a great product, but a great buy.  Delicious and nutritious: a great combination that I recommend highly 
 This was my first Queen album.  As soon as the radio started playing We Will Rock You, I needed this album.  I am still (30 yrs later) amazed at the sound on this recording.  Brian, Freddie and the guys really showed the world that rock was NOT DEAD!  If you look at the time (1977) we needed to be rocked, and that's what we got 
 Engelbert Humperdinck has been around for almost 40 years delighting his fans the globe over. And now with this his new cd, he has hit another home run. Laid back and fully in charge, Engelbert shows us why he is the King of Romance with this Jazz/Pop infused album. Several songs will become classics, such as "Love Songs" just beautiful, "There's No Good In Goodbye" a gem of a song, "My Confession" a new Enge classic, "With You I'm Born Again" an excellent song that will surely become a staple of Engelbert's concerts. Every song is performed with simple yet beautiful arrangements. A little Jazz mixed with Pop, this is a bold new step for Engelbert, and a good choice. Hopefully it will find a new public. I highly recommend this start of a new Engelbert era! 
    I have come across a number of introductions to Buddhism and this book alone seems to provide the necessary depth and clarity to a religion that may seem confusing to a novice (such as myself). I feel as though I have gained the proper groundwork to look deeper into paths that I seem to connect with.    The book is split into two sections ("The Wheel of the Dharma" and "The Wheel Rolls West"). The first sections reads well and is thoroughly interesting. THe second, however, reads more like an 8th grade social studies textbook. The amount of information is much more overwhelming and, in my opinion, less fullfilling.      Great book, great read, great beginning... 
 In a sense, this book is a mirror to the problems covered in Wittgenstein's "Philosophical Investigations"--albeit with tighter arguments and far less meandering than Wittgenstein's groundbreaking work (this was published three years before Wittgenstein's posthumous PI). Both men were dedicated to freeing philosophy from what Ryle terms "category errors"--misapplications of the ordinary referential scope of a given term ("mind" as a  concept which must necessarily oppose "substance" for instance--this duality forces us to ascribe and essentialize qualities to the incorporeal along the same lines as that of substance, by giving it attributes on the linguistic model of physical objects) These misapplications have led philosophers into vast problems which, by their very nature as linguistic misuses, are unsolvable (but not dis-solvable). Parts of it will provoke cries of "behaviorism!", but Ryle included a chapter near the end distancing his stance from Skinner et al. (how well he manages in this is debatable!) Brilliant, straightforward, and elegant, this is one the best works of 20th-century philosophy 
 I really enjoyed this book.  The ideas aren't necessarily original compared to other household organizing books, but it was more enjoyable to read than most.  I enjoyed the author's anecdotes and personal remarks throughout.  It made it more fun to read something that was already full of good advice.  I'd love a new and updated version that brings us more up to date with the technology that is omnipresent today, but even though this is dated, it doesn't feel that way.  Instead I'd call it "timeless".  I will keep this and enjoy reading it and referring to certain sections over and over again.  A great household resource 
  "The Time Traveler's Wife" is the best book I've read this year.    Niffenegger masterfully weaves together a time travel story with a romance. Her two lead characters, Henry and Clare are two of the most beautiful, realistic HUMAN characters I have ever read. They show the reader the true definition of unconditional love. They're accepting of eachother and their relationship is loving and complex. Their romance is moving in the same way as the two lovers is "The Notebook" (the movie, not the book).    Despite the unchronological ordering of the scenes throughout the novel, The Time Traveler's Wife is a continous mystery and it unravels sensibly and beautifully.  Read this book! 
 Interesting book but it tries to cover too much material some of which cannot be adequately grasped without the maths (though some of the explanatory notes help). It also ends with some worn out admonitions about the future of humanity and such stuff which plagues science popularization books 
 I had never read Mari Sandoz so I can't compare this to her other books.  The writing style is unique and pleasant.  It is a very interesting, and unfortunately sad story about Indian life on the great plains.  The book seems very well researched and therefore more interesting to read since it is about history.  The Indians suffered strategically from a lack of organization, but their whole life style was about independence and in fact a much more pure form of democracy in selecting and de-selecting their leaders.  In reading the story with regard to the lies and deceipt of the white men it reminded me that world politics and war is no different today than then.  Crazy Horse had attributes that leaders should aspire to, he wanted to help his people and he was not vain about himself as leader.  In the end he was tricked into surrender by his own people.  I thought it was one of the best books of Indian life and history that I have read 
 Season 1 and 2 of "Once and again" were simply fabulous and great. And I was looking forward to getting Season 3 on DVD when it was announced for January 2006. Now it is suddenly pulled from the release schedule. Why??? I sincerely hope that all "Once and again"-fans stand up for this and urge Buena Vista to release Season 3 as soon as possible!! 
 I think this is a great book for the kosher cook, and the price is fantastic - the lowest I've seen. The recipes are great, and the book is really beautiful. Would make a great gift for anyone who keeps kosher.  
 Jess Aarons, a ten year old boy, wanted to be the fastest kid in the fifth grade.  He practiced every morning during his summer break.  Jess loved to draw, although he realized that many people did not consider drawing a masculine trait.  When Jess met his new neighbor, an odd looking little girl named Leslie Burke, his life changed.  They became friends and shared a secret place, Terabithia.  Jess had to cope with the death of his friend.  It was a wonderful book that shows the importance of friendship.  I enjoyed the way the characters had real emotions.  The end of the book brought tears to my eyes. 
 I begged my job to let me leave and get this CD signed at the CD signing last year in NYC.  I mostly did this for my father who is a great Bobby Darin Fan.  But when I returned to work my co-workers mouths dropped as a played Kevin Spacey signing.  It was surprisingly well done.  The music is exciting, enjoyable and lifts the spirit.    With the release of this CD I was able to connect with my father like I had never done before.  We shared the promotional events  for this CD and the movie together.  We shared the concerts, movie and music.  This help him and I laugh, share, bond and enjoy each others company before it became to late.  My father loved sharing his Bobby Darin days and I have been a long time supporter of Mr. Spacey.  This created magic that allowed us to share stories of our love of each performer.  My father told me the story of how he would ride in his convertible with the top down blasting Darin music.  I never knew he was so cool.  I will always remember this experience with my dad and thank Mr. Spacey for helping me get to know my father better.   Oh and Mr. Spacey you hit another generation, my 10 year old nephew now has stated that SPLISH SPLASH is his new favorite song.     And a Grammy nomination too!!!  Congratulations.  I feel strongly that work that not only entertains but takes the art of entertaining a few steps further and brightens our lives should be recognized more.  
 Although this Cd was short, almost too short, I still enjoyed it. Here's how I would rate each song:  1. Perfectly: 4/5  2. Nothing's Wrong with me: 3/5 This song got old after a few days 3. Notice Me: 4/5 4. Get Real: 5/5 This was probably my fave song! 5. When the Rain Falls: 4/5 This was a sad song, but touching. 6. If You Wanna Rock: 4/5 Lalaine has a good voice! 7. Don't Even Try It: 2/5 THis song sounded too much like the boring whiney pop of some bands today. Unfortunately the chorus got stuck in my head! 8. Tru Blu: 5/5 This was my second favorite song!  If you like Radio Disney's pop bands, you'll like the CD. If not, don't bother. See ya 
 When thoroughly digested and fully comprehended, the principles and their practical application of James Allen's classic will Change Your Life...and more importantly the way you think about it, instantaneously 
 Some may find this terse, warmly witty, and tidy treatise about "whither literature in the world of CyberSpace" as just too esoteric to read.  Stop.  This is not a book grieving over the lost art of words and writing that nurtures the lives of all readers.  This wise book is a guide to the possibilites that elude pessimists wary of the ultimate effects of the computer on this century.  Relax, discover the possibilites about which you've never dreamed, and let Murray tell you some stories in the mode of the future.  For writers, for teachers....but also for the committed readers. Enjoy 
 There is not an extraneous reference, glance or heartbeat in I'M NOT SCARED. Economical is not the word ... more like urgent.  I'm tempted to compare it to Alice Sebold's THE LOVELY BONES, but that's rather easy. Jonathon Hunt's translation brings the 9 yr-old narrator's voice to life in a way that prompts flashbacks of MEMBER OF THE WEDDING or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Not for nothing does I'M NOT SCARED take place in southern Italy - there is a languid southern heartbeat here that American readers should recognize. Very easy to imagine an American film based on this story. Classic storytelling, but contemporary, with a quick, breathtaking finale.   Terrific. Worthwhile -- even if readable on a single Sunday 
 The Blossoming Lotus in Kauai was the best vegan cuisine I had ever eaten in a resteraunt.  We bought the cookbook so we could have more of there yummy food! The cookbook is great and the directions are consise. The recipes are easy and the ingredients are mostly natural. They have GREAT dressing recipes too. It also teaches you how to cook veggies the healthy and correct way.  I give it a 10 out of 10 
 Nazareth in the mid-70's was as ballsy and blusey as Grand Funk, the Rolling Stones and Bad Company, but with more "attitude". Loud 'n' Proud starts off with 5 "in your face" rockers with Dan McCafferty belting out the lyrics in his most distinctive voice. His voice is very high pitched and extremely rough, but I like it. The cover of Joni Mitchell's "This Flight Tonight" is good. "Child in the Sun" is a decent ballad but nothing extraordinary. Then comes "Ballad of Hollis Brown", Bob Dylan cover. What were they thinking? This creepy thing is about a guy who lives on a farm with his wife and five kids and is down on his luck. He kills all of them before killing himself. It's not the story that's bad. This thing drones on for over 9 minutes with nary a change in tempo or chording. It's like listening to someone drag their fingernails across a blackboard. The band themselves admit it was a poor choice for the album. And to top it off, the remastered edition gives us another shortened version of this 'song'. It's easy to program around but my complaint is that it takes up space that two good songs could have used. Except for this one blemish, this is a ballsy, gritty rock album 
      A very fine book, a must for those who seriously want to achieve their goals. Only with comitment goals can be conquered 
 L'edition francaise est plus complete et le packaging est en carton du plus bel effet.Sinon les bonus et langues sont identique 
 This is one of the best rubber stamping technique books I have come across.  Unlike many other technique books, Nancy sticks primarily to dimensional and textural effects that can be created with stamps and ink on paper.  There are a couple of projects devoted to stamping on other surfaces such as acetate or shrink plastic, but these are in the minority.  For those of you who are interested in broadening your techniques for rubber stamp art you use to create cards, you will not be disappointed with this book.  Nancy uses materials that are common to any stamper's stash--ink, stamps, watercolor crayons, glue gun, etc.  You won't have to go searching for exotic, hard-to-find or expensive materials to complete the projects.  I LOVE how the photos provide very clear step-by-step directions for each technique.  I don't know if Nancy is the model for the photos, but I sure smiled when I saw how each stamp was heavily ink-stained and obviously well-loved and used 
 I remember watching this show when I was 10 years old, and I have never forgotten it. I have about 24 of these episodes on tape, but didn't have "Spewey and Me" or "Girlfriend 2000," so these tapes go  great with my collection. I do, however, wish that they would have added  more than 2 episodes per tape. I also would like to see "Zoo Animals  on Wheels" and "Chris's Brain."  (The one where Chris learns  to spell because of Toxic Waste.) These are 2 awesome episodes, that I do  not have, and would love to see a great quality copy of either of these 2  episodes. Hopefully these 2 volumes will sell well, and encourage Rhino to  release more tapes. They should read these reviews to get an idea as to  what to put on the next volumes. Anyways, I'm just glad I got to see  "Spewey and Me" again 
 I grew up reading Pauline Kael's reviews, mostly by walking to the public library in the small town where I grew up -- I'd snag the New Yorker off the shelf and immerse myself in what she had to say about movies, many of which would never come to my town.  But I was enthralled.    I love her reviews now for the same reason I loved them then -- she makes me want to see the movies she writes about.  And more than that, she makes me want to see movies, period.  Her passion for the medium -- even when she doesn't like a film -- is contagious, and she expresses it beautifully.    Surprisingly to me, in these early reviews she frequently quotes the reviews of other critics and then mercilessly takes apart what they have said.  She particularly has it in for the New York Times' Bosley Crowther, but she doesn't let others off the hook easily, either.    Kael is fun to read, even if you haven't seen the movie she is talking about.  I've never seen "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone", though I have seen "Suddenly Last Summer" -- both based on works of Tennessee Williams.  But Kael's 1961 review of "Mrs. Stone" is a hilarious read.  In one part, she says:    "The men who filmed 'The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone' seem to think the idea of an aging woman seeking companionship and love so daring and unusual that they fumble around with it almost as much as the doctor in the screen version of 'Suddenly, Last Summer', who couldn't seem to cope with the simple facts of Sebastian's homosexuality and kept saying, 'You DON'T mean THAT?'-- 'No, it CAN'T be THAT?' -- 'WHAT are you saying?' -- 'What do you MEAN?'  I assumed the youngest child in the audience would get the point before he did.  By trying so diligently to make Mrs. Stone so sympathetic and understandable the director and writer, Jose Quintero and Gavin Lambert, kill all interest in her.  We could accept a woman buying love, but why make her haggle over it?"    Kael is hilarious, maddening, and most of all, thought-provoking.  And if you love movies, she'll make you love them more.  
 We were reluctant to buy this product because of some bad reviews we read about it, but we are really glad we decided to buy it!  So far we have not seen one single bug or rodent or spider around!  And believe me, we live in a "mountainy" area so we used to see them around all the time in our garage.  I have not seen them ever since we bought this product.  It is working for us 
 How do you plan to finance your retirement?  1. Savings 2. Social Security 3. Sale of kidneys  You need to be honest in your answer. If you lie, you'll only  be lying to yourself. And, according to advice given in DAVE BARRY'S MONEY SECRETS (from which this question was taken), "The place to lie in on your federal tax return."  This is a very funny guide that spoofs much of the personal financial advice that can be found in other books, TV shows and online . . . save your money on them; buy this one  instead . . . you may not get rich if you do, but you will certainly laugh a lot.  Barry has previously written on such other topics as politics, fitness and parenting . . . I enjoyed those, but this latest one may well be his very best--especially because it will make you wonder why  people behave the way they do when it comes to money.  For example, in the above quiz, he states, "That if your answers are all threes [on all the questions], be advised that we're having a minor technical problem calculating your score because of  Nigerian red tape. To smooth things out, we need you to send us an 'advance fee' of $5,000, which you will get back many times over."  The amazing thing is that many people do just that!  There were many other hilarious tidbits; among them: * Many children learn about money by starting their own businesses, the classic example being the sidewalk lemonade stand. This is an opportunity to teach your child fundamental economic principles. I'm not suggesting that you encourage your child to have a lemonade stand; that's WAY too much work. I'm suggesting that you explain to your child that if he buys lemonade from some other kid's stand, and then happens to choke on a lemon seed, they you would be in a position to sue the other kid's parents for thousands of dollars. That is what I mean by "fundamental economic principles."  * One way to take money is in the form of traveler's checks. The way these work is, you give a traveler's check company a bunch of money, and the traveler's check company gives you some checks. You cash some of these checks on your trip, and when you get home you put the rest of them in the back of your sock drawer for safekeeping, and then you forget all about them. Eventually you die, and the traveler's check company gets to keep the money you paid for the uncashed checks forever.  And this final one that--while presented in a humorous fashion--makes much sense at least to me:  *Presidential Election Campaign Fund checkoff box: If you check this box, $3 of your taxes will be earmarked for a special fund to pay for presidential campaigns. Notice that the government does not permit you to earmark money for poor people, or sick people, or national defense. No, the government permits you to earmark money only  for the purpose of enabling politicians to produce TV commercials designed to appeal to voters who have the IQ of a Vienna sausage. To make matters worse, some of this federal campaign money goes to candidates who have about as much chance of getting elected president as SpongeBob SquarePants. In 2004, of example, more than $800,000 of earmarked U.S. taxpayer dollars went to Lyndon LaRouche, a convicted felon and complete space loon who has been running for president since 1980, and who has claimed, among other things, that Walter Mondale was a Soviet agent and Queen Elizabeth II is a drug dealer. If you check the Presidential Election Campaign Fund box, it won't affect the amount of tax you owe, but I will lose all respect for you.  
 This is easily the best of the Celtic Woman releases. It is nice to see where all those soprano vocals originated from that now seem to be everywhere. There is no sense of the synthetic vocal sound that is now favored by these Celtic Divas. Meav sounds natural and sweet as Irish honey on this recording, and the choir, well, the choir is Anuna! Thank you for putting this gem on the market. I couldn't wait to unpack my copy 
 Emmylou has always had an edge to her. Hell, it's not like she had her career handed to her on a silver platter(though a certain friendship with Gram Parsons didn't hurt). And, in her older age, she shows off a contemplative, brooding and experimental side. On this album, she shows that she not only sings classic country. Modern folk is well within grasp. The fingerprints of Daniel Lanois are all over this album as well. It's got the 'atmosphere' sound and pulsing beat that distinguishes his sound. This may not be for the Emmylou purist, however, it stands as one of the best albums of all time.  
 Great Music. I'm not sure how I missed an artist as good as her for so long 
 I found this book to be extremely helpful for diagnosing problematic behavior and sound advice as to methods of correcting it.  I have shared this book with many of my managers and they are converts 
 This show as it was said in the first post is not for everyone and that was made abundantly clear by the mixed reviews that followed. For instance I personally loved Bizzaro, while I thought Stimutax was a little dark, not really the same line of humour as the other episodes. This of course is the exact opposite to the opinions of another reviewer. If you love the strange always twisted sence of humour of the adult swim line-up then you'll love this.   These first two seasons are a little tamer and not as zany (is that a word) as the later ones, and that will be very hard to belive from watching these. Captain Hazel 'Hank' Murphy (rest in peace Harry Goz) carries episodes not so well recieved by other reviewers such as Fuzebox and makes them great and as said in the first post the satirical elements wonderfully subtle in these first seasons (not so in the later ones) that are littered throughout each episode will keep you watching the episodes over and over again 
 My husband and I, being new boaters, stumbled upon the Isle of Shoals.  I looked the Isles up on-line after our trip and somehow came across the book title and ordered it.  I read it in one day, only leaving the couch to pee.  I loved the alternate story style and each time It switched, I was left with wondering what was happening in the other story.  One would have to see this island to imagine who could live there for 5 years without being driven to insanity.  It was all very real for me and I agree that the author probably nailed the murders on the head as they actually happened.  
 There is one huge problem with this cookbook,it is so wonderful, so full of outrageously delcious receipes that the binding just does not hold up to hard use.  I want a hard back copy and it simply is not available.  If you love to serve elegant delcious fare, then this is one of THE MUST HAVE, MUST USE cookbooks.  I am ordering my 4th copy as the others have all fallen apart due to over use.  This book will become a dependable "kitchen friend". I've even taken to keeping an extra copy on hand to gift to friends.  It is a rarity to find a cookbook where every receipe is foolproof, elegant, and delicious 
 One of the things I love about Shortcut is that it gives young children a chance to be scared/tense (like adults enjoying John Grisham or a suspenseful movie) in a way that isn't like to keep them awake later!  I used to teach four-year-olds, and, if read with expression, this book keeps them on the edge of their seats!  Donald Crews' relating of an actual childhood experience is powerful -- they decided to take the shortcut home -- over the train tracks. What happens when they realize a train is coming 
 WOW!  I couldn't put this book down ... Ginger Garrett easily led me into the life and times of Esther, from her life in the village to the time in the king's harem, all the way to becoming queen.  It  truly brought to life a story I didn't know much about, and kept me turning page after page to find out more!  Can't wait for her next book ... Ginger Garrett is now one of my favorite Christian authors ... right up there with Terri Blackstock, Janette Oke, and Lori Wick.  (Written by Anthony's wife Terryl 
 As I was reading The Shining Company I was thinking this is the best adventure book I ever read. I also couldn't keep my eyes off it and a number of times my teacher kept telling me to put the book down and pay attention. At first I didn't want to read it but I did and it got better and better until I couldn't stop reading it. It's also the first Rosemary Sutcliff I've ever read and I will probably read more 
 Ive had this book for many years, and keep going back to it.  There are exercises in the book to help you make the aspirations concrete by writing it out in addition to the visualizations.    Whenever I have a money issue, I randomly pick a page and see what message it has for me at this point in time.  Unlike some other new age postive thinking books, the downside of things is not ignored. This is well rounded inspiration that shows you how to deal with the kinks as well.   The author even says that you must get practical knowledge to compliment the metaphysical awareness.  From my point of view, you must have both, for there to be a balance. It is whole brain thinking.  
 True Believer has to be one of the best movies ever made. The evidence I introduce to support my case is I have watched it 7-8 times without becoming remotely tired of it. (Raiders of the Lost Ark, another favorite of mine, got a little tedious after 3 viewings). True Believer is James Woods at his very best. The story is very plausible and the clues unravel at a perfect pace throughout the film. In fact, the movie gives you the opportunity to piece the puzzle together as the characters do. Robert Downey Jr., is the perfect naive "sidekick" to James Woods cynical been-through-the-grinder attorney. Kurtwood Smith is perfect as the district attorney. If you are a James Woods fan and haven't seen this movie you are in for a treat. Buy it 
 This book is about the author, a Mid westerner, travelling  to Mississippi to learn more about the state where his people came from.  It is extremely well done.  The author travels around the state, interviews many prominent and not-as-prominent Mississippians about problems, solutions, and opportunites for the state to move beyond its history of severe racial problems. In the process he summarizes a lot of history, and introduces many insights about how Mississippi got where it is and what it needs to do to move on.  One thing I, as a white Mississippian with a somewhat liberal bent, found refreshing was his not falling into the trap that many of us Mississippians do of saying that all of that stuff is old news and we have moved beyond it.  Things are undoubtedly better now than before, but while segregation may not be legal it is still very alive in the hearts and minds of the residents, both black and white If books like Walton's cause us to reexamine some of our "truths" about the state, it will have served an extremely useful purpose.  At any rate, for one wanting to understand more about Mississippi, reading this book is a good way to do it. 
 I've never really been a big fan of Lucinda but wanted to give this Fillmore release a chance.  Glad I did.    She delivers each song from the soul and she's surrounded by a great band.  I won't say this is a lot of fun to listen to - you sort of go through experiences with her - but she may be one of the best story tellers out there and each of these performances tells us a little more about this fantastic singer.  And for those who haven't listened to much of her music this isn't straight country.  There are jazz and rock sounds going on here.  This is a nice release that's well worth the money 
 I got this TV to use in an art studio for some training videos, DVDs and connection to cable TV. It works great, the picture is excellent. No issues at all 
 1971....such a long time ago.  Yes, this book has outdated references regarding clothing and gender subservience....but that doesn't negate the value of the sensuality exercises!  An excellent book to read in bed aloud  to your mate to drive him nuts....especially the sexual techniques  section...great source of sweet and wonderful fantasies to play out.. 
 Very informative data. A must read for those who want to figure out why they can not lose weight.Dr.Scott Connelly reveals foods that affect your metabolism. Focusing on "Fructose" that switches your metabolism from fat burning to fat storage. Great illustrations and diet plans. Substantiated resource, coming from a Harvard graduate, researcher and renowned athetic trainer 
 de Becker does a good job at putting the risks of terrorism into perspective with other risks we face everyday.  Also, de Becker encourages the reader to be informed and aware of situations that could be indicators of trouble.  Well worth the read. 
 I actually bought this book hardback, at full price (unusual for me!) I couldn't put this book down, and neglected all motherly and household duties to finish it in a day. Now I'm sad that I read it so quickly.   
 No wonder Zach Braff used this moving wonderful album piece, "Let Go" for Garden State.  The moving lyrics and soulful music touch my heart. Will be buying this one!!! 
 David Rusk, former mayor of Albuquerque, NM, puts his experience and research to work in this compelling report.  In it, he connects the economic and practical success of America's urban centers with the degree  of socioeconomic and racial segregation present in each.   The result is a  blueprint that local, state and federal officials can use to reverse the  troubling trends in our cities.  Specifically, he calls for metro-wide  planning councils, city-county consolidation, aggressive annexation by  older central cities, and changes to state and federal laws to create   unified cities without suburbs. The text also includes numerous interesting  case studies that demonstrate what, when practiced, his ideas are capable  of. Easy-to-read, fascinating, and enlightening.  David Rusk is talking.   Are America's city officials listening 
 Schreiner does a wonderful job of taking any student of biblical exegesis through the process of developing an accurate exegesis of any Pauline Epistle. His reliance on grammar clues and diagramming make this an extremely helpful book for theologians who wish to allow Scripture to speak for itself. If you are seeking to better understand Scripture...this book is a MUST 
 If you live in a city without English in its bookstores, what do you read? Well, odds are you encounter a Westerner from time to time and exchange books you've read for books you haven't. You never know what you'll wind up with. It's Book Crossing, taken to a much higher level.   And so it was that I found myself looking at a battered copy of MORGAN'S PASSING, with no memory of who gave it to me or what book(s) I gave up in return. Pages brown and falling out, cover falling off, blurbs that make it sound like something I didn't want to read. But, a desperate junkie in need of my reading fix, I gave it a shot.   And, at last, the review. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story of how I obtained it is much like the character of Morgan himself. He just kind of appears -- you don't know why -- but you're glad you met the memorable eccentric. This book is witty, original, and well worth reading. Ignore the [...] on the cover about "the love story." The book has one, but it's incidental. Some marketing bozo didn't know how to describe true creativity.   Okay, time to go broke ordering more Anne Tyler books from Amazon. All the way from China. There's even a Putlizer Prize winner in there. 
 In reading and reviewing two of Bernard Lewis's recent books (What Went Wrong? Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response 2002 and The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Holy Terror 2003) I was favorably impressed with not only his obvious erudition, but with his reasoned tone and his realistic perceptions.  However, in this volume, which is a collection of some of his writings going back to the 1950s, I found myself a bit mystified.  On the one hand there is the brilliance and eloquence for which the venerable historian is well known.  On the other hand, there are some strange and unsettled statements which lead me to wonder if Professor Lewis has not lost some of his fabled acuity.  First, there is the inclusion of a very short piece entitled "We Must Be Clear" that he wrote for the Washington Post a few days after September 11, 2001 in which he is anything but.  Apparently Lewis wants the US to be clear about its intentions in the Middle East in light of the terrorist attacks on 9/11.  He concludes that "What is needed is clarity in recognizing issues and alignments, firmness and determination in defining and applying policy." (p. 370)  What this vague and essentially empty pronouncement follows is Lewis's apprehension that some states are "friends" on two levels, one "a deep mutual commitment" and the other "based on a perception of shared interests." (p. 369-370)  One will permit me a "You don't say?" here.  In this same piece Lewis mentions that Saddam Hussein "has made war against three of his neighbors..." and that the other states in the Middle East "are neither forgetful of the past nor confident of the future."  What Saddam Hussein (and what his neighbors think about him) has to do with 9/11 is unclear.  It's as if Lewis had something he wanted to say, some connection he wanted to draw, but was unable to be clear about it, perhaps for political reasons or because he thought he knew something he wasn't at liberty to share.  At any rate, even more disconcerting is the article entitled "A Time for Toppling" from the Wall Street Journal a year later (September 26, 2002) in which he seems to be a stalking horse for Bush's desire to invade Iraq.  He doesn't however argue so much that Saddam Hussein is a danger to the US, but instead makes the claim that in order to solve the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, it is first necessary to deal with Saddam.  There is some legitimacy to this argument, and Lewis recalls Saddam's policy of rewarding the families of Palestinian suicide bombers with stipends of $10,000 to $25,000.  However what is grievously wrongheaded about this "toppling" that Lewis seems unaware of--as was Bush and the neocons in the White House--is that in invading Iraq, the US would create massively more problems than it would solve, and would only exacerbate the predicament of the Israeli and Palestinian people, since the Arab and Muslim world would rally around a kindred Muslim nation invaded by a foreign power even if it was the fiefdom of a hated dictator.  I am surprised that the usually wise and learned Professor Lewis could write so nakedly in favor of the foolishly aggressive policy of the Bush administration.  Personally, I think Lewis revealed here the true heart of the historian: such a person may be incredibly wise and reasonable when he has time to think and rethink an issue and has the benefit of his research and a considerable experience; however when he is called upon to make a quick judgment on events still warm in the doing, his judgment may suffer.  So let me recall the Bernard Lewis of the volumes mentioned above and let me quote from a couple of places in this collection in order to balance what would be, on the basis of these two articles, a misconception of the man.  Consider, for example, this statement on the three Abrahamic religions of the Middle East: "If we look at them in a wider global perspective, Judaism, Christianity and Islam are different branches of the same religion....Compared with the religions of India, of China and of other places, they are as alike as peas in a pod."  Lewis goes on to make the point that when Muslim and Christian say to one another, "'You are an infidel and you will burn in hell,' they understand each other perfectly."  However "Such an argument between a Christian or a Muslim on the one side and a Buddhist or a Hindu on the other" would have been "impossible" because "They would not have known what they were talking about." (pp. 200-201)  This insight is from his essay "A Taxonomy of Group Hatred" which originally appeared in the Viennese review Transit in 1998-1999.  This is a particularly good essay (published in English here for the first time) in which Lewis doesn't mince words about the human failing called hatred and gives a most interesting psychological and historical take on this most destructive emotion which he allies lamentably with the very essence of the human process of self-identity.  He notes, "Loyalty to the tribe, however defined, and hatred of other tribes are at the very core of identity." (p. 203)  There are 51 essays arranged in three parts, "Past History," "Current History," and "About History."  There are pieces on such diverse subjects as money, travel and food in addition to the usual political concerns of historians.  Particularly good, because of the insight it affords us into the life of Bernard Lewis, is the Introduction in which he outlines his career as a Middle Eastern historian.  I recommend this book for readers who want to increase their knowledge of the Middle East.  Here is Lewis's own justification for such a study: "The history of Islam is a vital and essential part of human history without which even 'our' own history is not fully intelligible." (p. 412 
 Authors Brian E. Becker, Mark A. Huselid and Dave Ulrich teach human resources (HR) executives that everything their departments do can influence their companies' profits - but not just in terms of their administrative actions. HR can have a meaningful impact on the corporation by developing employees' in-depth awareness of the business, studying the drivers that generate the employee behaviors that move the company's strategy forward and establishing a new core competency model for HR professionals. We strongly recommend this book as essential for HR executives - and as an illuminating text for other corporate leaders, right up to CEOs. While your company's HR department may already measure performance, chances are those measurements don't evaluate the real dollars-and-cents impact on the bottom line. In fact, this book shows how to determine what to measure with your HR Scorecard, how to measure it and how to report back in fiscal terms that upper management can appreciate. This is an affirmation and a roadmap for everyone who ever wanted to prove that HR, strategically deployed, can significantly influence a company's performance and profitability 
 Col. Hammes has taken the original thesis of "we make war the way we make money" presented by the Toffler's in "War and Anti-War" and fleshed it out with real examples. He provides a useful background of he various "generations" of war or the evolutions that war has made as economy and cultures have changed, moves on to a description of Fourth Generation warfare (4GW) and then provides detailed examples including present date. It's important to understand that although this book is about 4GW or insurgency warfare, it is also about the direction warfare is taking. The United States must be ready for conflicts that span the spectrum from 2GW to what will become 5GW. 4GW is like any insurgency...it requires lots of human skill, good communications, and interagency support...and something that Americans are not known for....patience. If you are a soldier interested in insurgency and how it is evolving this is a MUST READ book. If you are a civilian you'd better read this book if you want to understand how the world is unfolding around you. This book gets Mike Barr's 6 Star Rating

 I am a huge fan of alt-country, roots rock, Americana or whatever you wanna call it.  This is a classic in the genre.  Here are some lesser known albums in the genre that are fantastic. 1) End Of The Day by The Reivers  2) Idiots by Frog Holler 3) Banjos and Sunshine by Sixty Acres 
 Having spent 32 years in Information Technology, I find this book right on the mark.  It is a must read for ALL CEOs and their I/T executive that may be contemplating a major change in their orgainzation or heading into to a project of any type or size.  The authors use more than a half century of experience to describe how any major project, with or without an I/T component, will fail if proper management techniques and practices are not understood and followed.  You may even think this book is about you and if you don't read it carefully and heed the advise, it may well be in the future 
 Arthur Danto raises many interesting points to help understand art today. In many cases his ideas are very insightful. It made me wonder about what  came first, Danto's ideas, or the artist's ideas as revealed in their work 
 I hate to admit it...especially because all the other reviewers have raved about it...but I find Truth and Method to be a real slog. Yes -- there is some good stuff here. But be warned - you will really, really have to work to get through this book!   Now at this point you may be thinking "well, you are probably lazy or were unprepared." But the thing is - I was neither. I have read Being and Time (which I think is an easier - yes easier - book) and have done much prepatory work for T & M including Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics by Jean Grondin -- which I highly recommend).  This book is brilliant. But I think it is very interesting that all the reviewers have such high praise for a text that is so very difficult. Great ideas do not need to be inaccessible. Don't believe me? Look at Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche.... 
 I loved my 8 inch Global chef knife so much I ordered this veggie knife.  Oh wow, this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies.  It also fits in your hand extremely well. If you are going to cut up a potato, it is hard to beat the chef's knife.  However, for cutting up a tomato, carrot, etc. this thing is the best tool I have ever used.  Just wonderful 
 To play Gershwin accurately demands from the player, the absolute domain of an invisible taste, unsaid in the score. Few pianists (and Bernstein is among them) were able to convey the listener, this savoir vivre, humor, elegance, that idiomatic atmosphere that plainly justifies your effort.  To my mind, there just have been five pianists who have surmounted this peak: Oscar Levant, Jesus Maria Sanroma, Eugene List, Earl Wild and Leonard Bernstein.    So, under any pretext you should miss this invaluable musical gem. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This author has remarkable talent. This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read.  The main character, Nikki, lost her waitress job (which she hated, anyway) due to a whiny customer. She then, fortunately, snagged a much better job at a winery. However, things didn't go too smoothly for her at first. After having to put up with crazy people in her boss's family and finding dead bodies . . .   She did her own detective work to find the killer. And the same time, she and her boss were falling for each other romantically.  The atmosphere of this book is very cozy. I loved both the atmosphere and the mystery part.  This book has recipes to go with the wines. They do sound good. Especially the very last one, "After Hours Pasta", sounds so easy to make, and also sounds good.  The first two books of this wine series ("Murder Uncorked" and "Murder by the Glass") are absolutely wonderful and entertaining. I can't wait to read the third one. 
 The Loyalty Effect is an analysis of the effects of loyalty.  The author, Frederick F. Reichheld, takes a rigorous looks at a variety of successful companies and finds that those "that earned superior levels of customer loyalty and retention also earned consistently higher profits" and sustainable levels of growth.  The examples and data shown in this book give a clear picture of how loyalty can be earned through strong value creation and why this leads to long-term profitability and growth.  Beyond customer loyalty, the author also looks at how the right employees, the right investors and the right partnerships can add to the overall strength of a company.  The evidence that Reichheld presents in support of loyalty-based management is thought provoking and compelling.  While the author himself doesn't proclaim this that style of management is a magic "cure all", Reichheld's argument is extremely convincing and the research supporting his claim is clear: loyalty makes good economic sense.  People running businesses, big and small, can benefit from the ideas presented in The Loyalty Effect.  I highly recommend this book. 
 The audio CD version of Dubois' "Souls of Black Folks" is horrible. The reader makes mistake after mistake. He mispronounces words, makes breaks where none were to be taken, and his reading in general is poor. He has made a vibrant and enjoyable read a boring and atrocious listening experience. I guess I'll have to find something else to listen to on those long drives. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT Purchase this rendering of "Souls" 
 God bless Lilias Folan. Over 30 years after she first inspired my life. This is her best book- a reflection of her life long persuit of self knowledge and the best layman's guide to Eastern philosophy I've ever read. Complete with understandable definitions of sanskrit terms.   Finally, a book that helps you to develop your own home practice. Thank you-again- Lilias. Thank you I so love this book.

 I have learned more about Linear Algebra from this single book than all my other assorted (and fairly expensive!) texbooks combined; and, for that matter, more than my college class on the subject too. I'm now studying Differential Geometry and I always have this book nearby (in addition to two other Shaum's Outlines: that of Vector Analysis and Differential Geometry). Every textbook has something to offer - at least I usually give them the benefit of the doubt ;-). But for gaining a "working knowledge" of abstract mathematical concepts, there's nothing so enlightening than studying the details of problem solving performed with delightful clarity by an expert in the field. In this book you can become the apprentice to Seymour Lipschutz as he reveals the mysteries that often form clouds in the minds of students of Linear Algebra.  Frequently, when working in this text, I would suddenly understand something that seemed so complex or obscure in my other LA texts. Actually, I could then see what those other texts were attempting to convey but because of their particular styles, they were just a bit "pedagogically challenged" :-)  Anyway, for me, this book is worth more than any pricey textbook on the subject. Just buy it and use it! You'll begin to see how cool Linear Algebra really is. Beware - mathematics at this level and beyond can be very addictive!  DH 
 To review this book at length would ignore its lessons. My only advice is to read it and discover the Dogen for yourself.  You might come away thinking he's an idiot. He'd say he'd succeeded mightily in your education.  
 Leopold von Sacher-Masoch manages to illustrate a deep sexual fantasy and moralize at the same time.  The author artfully shows the reader the pain endured by Severin, the main character, and the twisted pleasure obtained from it.  The obsession over furs is just one aspect of his pain-pleasure complex.  It seems that von Sacher-Masoch, like Sade,oversimplifies complex feelings through autobiographical characters.  However, unlike Sade's de Franval, the main character seems open to the possibility that this "deviant behavior" isn't perfection, but the manifestation of a personal problem dealt with in an unhealthy way. He seems to have enough of an open mind to "learn."  I highly recommend this novella and think any reader interested in Erotica at all will enjoy it. 
 J.D. Robb's futuristic series starring Eve Dallas, edgy investigator, gets better with each outing. This one brings back all my favorite characters - foremost Peabody - with a riveting mystery involving DNA and cloning and all things related that linger on the horizon. I absorbed every page and, as always, eagerly await the next one 
 The shipping was fast and the book was in excellent condition! Thank yo
