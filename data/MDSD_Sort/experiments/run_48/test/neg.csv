 I bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats.  I like the scalloped edges, the pillow and the colorful pictures, but I am disappointed in the playmat overall.  The pat mat leaks so bad that I can't use it. The playmat is cute, but it isn't functional, not to mention, WAY OVERPRICED.  The arches have netting which I think freaks my son out.  He has never liked this playmat.  I have a square one that he seems to enjoy more 
 I ordered this thinking it was a Magazine, it is more like a newspaper. It has good information, but it was not what I thought it would be.  
 If you adore the intellect and see in it the only way to the highest, purest, and most divine knowledge, than this is your book--but it isn't mine.  Page after page of speculation about the higher realms open only to  a mind freed from the crude considerations of the flesh....I kept hoping  that Plotinus would realize his vision and disappear before finishing, but  it didn't happen 
 I was very dissapointed with my purchase, as the citrus taste of the water was absolutely terrible and I just could not drink it, so there's a whole case sitting unused on my porch.  Waste of money 
 A lot of hype and nonsense showing how feminists extremists view the night life scene in Bangkok.  From their fanatical point of view only.  And of course when one of their own disagrees with them, such as, Cleo Oldzer, rather than question themselves, they dump on her.  These people remind me of the academics in the play Equus, who had no hope of enjoying life.  A very boring book in which they love to babble about "tropes."  Well, sweetiepies, trope THIS 
 This book was ok but not near as good as until the twelfth of never. that book really gives you more of an inside look into the life of Dan and Betty Broderick. This book is a quick read if you are looking for a light read on the story and not a lot of details 
 Road Trip - USA returns you a time when America was much, much slower paced. I purchased this book because I am interested in motorcycling some of these roads in the near future. Preferable, U.S.-50. A well written book that touches on the main points of interest across, and up and down America.I am looking forward to traveling some of these roads 
 Just look at the cover and you know what you're getting into.  The author of this book is probably a bigger horror film fan than ghost hunter. You don't go writing a book about ghost hunter guessing your way though the facts and then even worse.... giving your opinions instead of facts.  This is by far not an exact science and it should not be treated as one especially if your as opinionated as this wanna be who wrote this book.   Burn it! 
 Hello - My wife and I are big Rachael Ray fans, and since I love to cook she bought this item for me. We thought it was a neat idea, because I had been using 2 cutting boards and this might eliminate the need for both. I used a thick wooden one for most stuff, and a thinner plastic one for raw meats. The plastic one was always hard to wash and store, and if you cook 2 or 3 days in a row was hard to always get in the dishwasher and be available.  When we first started using this it was great, I actually gave away my other 2 cutting boards! Now keep in mind this was a Christmas gift Dec 2006. Today is Jan 30 2007, and the board has "bowed" across the middle. Kind of like someone grabbed each side and bent it up a little, it looks almost warped. Also, a large crack has developed that spans the length of the board. I have taken pictures of this and plan to submit them to the manufacturer to see if they would like to do anything about it.  We never put it in the dishwasher, and didnt treat it any differently than the other wooden cutting board we had for the last 4 years, right now we are very dissapointed with it. I decided to give it 2 stars instead of 1, because the idea is a good one, and for the first month we thought we had a very cool and functional product.  We will update this post when we hear back from the manufacturer.  (Note: We did not purchase this board from Amazon, although I wish we had. They are awesome at making their customers happy, and have great customer service!! 
 I have to wonder what world, what physical plane, what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on? Or maybe they are Full Moon employees LOL...First of all, the movie, especially one of the earlier scenes, was identical to the 80's flick "The Unnamable", which is also and HP Lovecraft based flick. The castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit. When he breaks out his cell, well this was just hilarious, it reminded me of the incredible hulk. Yes, Jeffrey Combs is in it. But his acting is cheesy as it can be. Hunt down The Unnamable instead, a much better movie 
 As an alum of a top 20 B-School, I thought this would be a perfect fit.  However the book is just a colledtion of examples which offer no practical advice.  One would be much better off consulting the book "Discovering Your Career in Business"  by Butler and Waldroop of HBS 
 I resent the comment of the reviewer who said this is the worst film in 100 years.  I make it 200.  The other reviewers have noted the idiotic factual mistakes that makes this such a howler.  I just loved the U.S Air Force personnel with Scottish and English accents.  They must have overrun the $500 budget at that point.  
 Madame Lenard's book is really quite a charmer, and it is her simple adventures that outweigh her rather amateurish writing. Regardless of the imperfections of the book, it is still delightful and interesting. She writes from her heart and you can feel her love for her village stretch from the pages. Some may find the author a bit pretentious and full of herself, but I dismiss that as just part of being French. (She is much more French than American, having been born and raised in France.) Enjoy this book for its content and the author's affections and just dismiss the lack of writing prowess 
 This is the most misinformed intolerant religious right wing propaganda I have ever read.  The author obviously took many assumptions about paganism and stereotyped the entire group.  His arguments against it hold as little logic as he claims the pagan community uses in their own beliefs.  I would strongly recommend not purchasing this book of intolerance and social hatred 
 3 of my friends' sons have had this tractor. All 3 have complained of the tires popping right off, exposing the wire that connects the 2 together. I figured maybe it was because they bought them from another retailer or something, maybe rough housing? Though our sons are 2, they're truly not rough with these much cherished Cars toys! :)  Anyway, bought mine from the Disney store for [...] 2 days later, after watching my son simply watch the movie w/the tractor, play randomly w/it- nothing crazy- the tire popped right off. Thank God I noticed before my other son, who is 15 months old!  Good luck with this one- I'm on my way to write the company on this disastrous & dangerous product- don't purchase is my advice, unless you want a sort of rental toy (it WILL break within days 
 I had to buy this book for a class; if you're interested in a historical perspective on instructional technology, you might find this interesting.  I didn't 
 I traded my girlfriend my Nickelback CD for Joss Stone. Now I kinda wished I had kept my Nickelback CD. She hates the Nickelback CD and I hate the Joss Stone CD, but she also hates the Joss Stone CD. If I kinda liked the Nickelback CD better I would of kept it because I kinda knew I wasn't going to be into the Joss Stone CD. But I just kind of figured the Joss Stone CD would be a little bit better than the Nickelback CD and my girlfriend was completely thinking that the Nickelback CD was gonna be a LOT better than the Joss Stone CD, but man was she let down completely. And for as much as I really don't want the Nickelback CD back at this point I just assume let her keep it and I'll get by with the Joss Stone CD. I mean I guess what I am trying to say is that I sorta liked the Nickleback CD in the beginning, but once my girlfriend said she hated it I figured I got the better end of the bargain by trading her for the Joss Stone CD which at first seemed like a much better CD to have than Nickelback. I think my girlfriend wants to trade back again and if we do then I guess I just have to live with the Nickelback CD, but I'll prolly never play it again if she gives it back to me. BLEH!!  Matthew 
 I liked CIDE a lot, so I looked forward to the American version with CD-Rom.  More than half of CIDE was removed, though.  The definitions and usages are clear, so I would recommend this book for anyone seeking a small  dictionary.  For those searching for more, either get CIDE (Cambridge Int  Dict of English) or Merriam Webster Tenth Collegiate.  The CD-Rom is a  simple compilation of the text, with a word lookup.  No frills at all.  The  Random House 2nd CD is much superior, as is the MW 10C CD 
 Employment Law for Business, 2nd Edition, is a text that covers legal topics such as; The Employer-employee Relationship, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Affirmative Action, Employment Discrimination, Sexual  Harassment, Job Performance and Behavior, Rights of Privacy, Protection of  Employee Safety, Income, Retirement, and Health.  This is a good tool for  managers 
 The most disappointing thing about The News from Paraguay is the beginning, and not precisely because is a bad one, but because in the first chapters of Lily Tuck National Prize awarded novel,  there's a hint that  could have been better than it turn out to be. So I confess that  for a few pages (those that engage a reader with a book) I found  charming the decimononic  story of Ella Lynch, a beautiful widow living in Paris well beyond her means. That even when  Ella decided to follow hairy Franco -a paraguayan stud- not because his looks, not even for this foolish thing called love, but because  he smelled like luxury and power in a faraway land; I still found it a joyable read,  but right when she arrived to her privileged life of  "querida"  of the most powerful man in Paraguay and began to have one baby after another in tumultuous times,  The News from Paraguay became boring and I began to skip entire paragraphes until I got to a previsible end. Based on true facts, the life of a Paraguayan dictator and his irish  mistress; Tuck, who confessed that she never went and wasn't interested in ever going to Paraguay (i think she finally did) can't even get the spanish names right: Mauel, instead of Manuel, Rosaria, instead of Rosario; Iez, instead o Ins. What's the deal with the ? Maybe I lost something in my not so good english, but I still can't get why,  a so so novel like The news from Paraguay, can win a National Prize 
 The only misstep so far in a wonderful series.  I was so eager for the book, I got a copy of the British edition, before it got to the US.  But I was disappointed.  Somehow this just just doesn't get off the ground.  Could Davis be tiring of Falco?  It seems to me that she is.  Maybe it's time to DO something, Lindsey!  Make some real changes in tbe characters' situations or kill them off.  Real dullness in the supporting cast and plot, and the main characters (besides Falso, who always has a life of his own) pall 
 I saw him live in 1987 when he was hot and hoped this would be a great reminder of his hilarious sense of humor and delivery but it was far too short (only 45 minutes) and only had a couple of good routines.  My hopes were higher than what this delivered!  The bonus material was taken from Vegas when he was near the end and it really was not very funny.  I would recommend looking at another DVD of his rather than purhcase this one 
 I bought this curling iron impulsively, as I perused through the "gold box" items some time ago.  When I first received the it, I was amazed at how well it worked; it heated up quickly, and did a wonderful job on my hair.  After a couple months, I turned it on, left the room for a minute, and came back to find the tip melted off, hanging from a strand of what little plastic was still attached.  I thought about returning it, but decided (rather stupidly, in retrospect) to continue to use it...BIG MISTAKE.  It heated up way beyond what it should have, even when I put it at a "low" setting of 5.  When I attempted to use it, the sizzling sound indicated to me that I had, indeed, made a mistake.  The next day, coworkers were commenting on my lovely new SHORT haircut.  If you're really interested in purchasing this item, please learn from my mistake, and if the tip melts off, take that as a sign that it will also melt your hair 
 Mr. Newell uses an entertaining style to make his points, and the overriding philosophy he espouses hasn't changed, but strategies and tactics have!  He doesn't seem to have recent real-life experience with  data analysis or online efforts. The biggest successes are derived from a  combination of academics and street-wise, hands-on tactics 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 After seeing some of the other Amazon reviews of this movie, and the fact that Jason Swartzman was in it (after having seen him for the first time in "Rushmore" - a wonderful film), I had to purchase a copy of this DVD for myself to view.  It's got a wonderful cast of fine actors, but I found this movie really dumb.  One critic on the DVD box claimed this was "Laugh Out Loud Funny."  Really?  What movie was he watching?  I strained a chuckle here and there, but that was about it for me.  The Lily Tomlin & Dustin Hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script.  I know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie, but I didn't find much to snicker about.  
 I had hoped for much more from my first Cherry Adair book - the recommendations had been so good.  But the writing is simplistic, the characters lack dimension, the "suspense" is convuluted and not even remotely realistic, and the sex is formulaic.  Silly me, to want a little romance in my romance novels!  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it, but I'll stick to Susan Andersen, Linda Howard and Karen Robards for my romantic thrillers from now on 
 This book provides an intriguing look back at a time when the Dot Com Boom was at its zenith, shortly before the crash. Interestingly, there is no sense of the impending doom that lies just over the horizon.  Lewis' "Liar's Poker" was extremely enjoyable, particularly because of the flash and personality of the central players. In this book, Lewis seems to have lost his way as he tries to wring interest from a much less compelling or likable chief character. The tone of the book is further weakened by the constant labels applied to Clark's disciples as the "smartest," "best," "greatest," and "most ingenious," individuals in their various fields.  What strains credibility, however, is the attribution of all Clark's successes to his incredible intelligence and foresight, while the fault of his failures is cast on the incompetent actions and short-sighted beliefs of others. History will probably not judge Clark as charitably as Lewis -- especially since most of the Clark's companies have either failed outright or remain but shells of their Dot Com era glory (most notably SGI, Netscape, and Healtheon).  Throughout the book, Jim Clark is touted for wealth that amounts to between $3 and $4 billion. The list of 2004 Forbes 400 Richest in America shows Jim Clark with an approximated net worth of $700 million. For a man who brags he will quit making money when his fortune eclipses that of Oracle's Larry Ellison, today Clark probably most regrets the loss of his favorite designation: billionaire.  
 This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it 
 Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking.  This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.  Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.    The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias.   
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 Not a bad book if you looking at the areas of Northern Baja and the Cabo San Lucas area. Out of 258 pages about 130 pages cover these area while only 58 cover the remainder. There are much better books out there 
 I agree with the comment below.  Boring.  I also have read all the books in the series and look forward to each new one.   This one was not up to the standard I expected with the In Death Series. By the end of the first chapter you knew the killer and why.  The conflict with Mira didn't fit either. Maybe the next one will be better 
 In this book you'll read about a love story. Pathetic but at least a love story. You'll read about New Orleans, a nurses's life, a hit man that blunders once and again. But what about the main plot? Why everybody was interested in Karen's life? Why, you'd read about that at the last 50 pages or so. So if you only read the last pages you'll save a lot of time.  I think LH can write better than this. 
 A friend recommended this book to me, so I picked it up.  From the start, I had to force myself to keep going.  I read the whole book, but I wouldn't recommend it 
 I bought this book because I wanted to learn something new about bandsaws.  Mind you, I have been using bandsaws for years, but this book told me absolutely NOTHING new.  A good book on bandsaws would include other uses for the saws than just cutting wood and such.  For instance, in my years of using bandsaws I have found that bandsaws are good for cutting large pieces of meat, even frozen (except sometimes it breaks the bandsaw and once I hurt myself quite badly).  No mention of that in the book!  Bandsaw blades make excellent plates at "MANLY" dinner parties (again, one injury once) but NO mention of the book.  Plus the book fails to mention any novel bandsaw techniques, even for wood.  No mention of the "zen fruit" technique a lot of builders are using now, and scarcely a nod to the "all thumbs" method pioneered by sweedish bandsaw enthusiasts 
 I love The Great Gatsby, so I have high standards when it comes to its films. The 1974 version was adequate at best. It looks very dated now-- like it was the 1970s trying to be in the 1920s. Not very modern in the filmmaking sense.   This production is just bad. The acting is basically horrid, especially on Mira Sorvino's part. Sorvino was badly miscast as Daisy. She didn't have the right voice, look, or mannerisms that the WASP-y Daisy Buchanan has. In fact, Sorvino is Italian. So why on earth is she playing a 20s socialite WASP? She really butchered the role. Toby Stephens, while not exactly the definitive Gatsby, doesn't do a bad job. He's got the stellar smile down pat and he's very suave. I don't think it was a case of bad acting with Stephens, I just think he concentrated too much on Gatsby's phoniness and not enough on the redeeming qualities in the character. And despite what people say, I thought Paul Rudd was good as Carraway. At least he did a fine job of narrating.   The cinematography and all that wasn't bad, but not enough research went into the costumes and makeup. Daisy's hair was not period-appropriate at all. Hello, bob and finger waves! Where are you? And her clothing wasn't right either.     So, if you want to see a decent production of The Great American Novel watch the 1974 version, but if you want to see a definitive production of The Great Gatsby, you'll have to keep waiting... 
 This book disappoints.  I mean really, really disappoints.  NOTHING happens for half the book, and then, she slips in a little bit of plot and a neat conclusion.  Really, why read a whole book for a half-books worth of story?  This book has two acts.  Act I: What Fitz does when he isn't doing anything interesting.  Act II: A short plot, which is extended to fill half the book.  Basically, if you LOVE Fitz, you will LOVE the book.  Of course, I don't LOVE Fitz or even the Fool (since his personality and demeanor change all the time).    While Robin can come up with interesting magical details about the worlds she writes about, her characters are unrealistic.  They behave like real people, but they don't behave like "assassins" or "royalty" should.  They behave like regular people.  Surely, assassins would not share a similar mindset to say, your little brother.  But yet, in Robin Hobb's world, her characters are designed to create that empathetic response in their behavior, and her plots spin and twist to avoid their character having to do something that most people would hate to do, say like kill some innocent guy in his sleep like an assassin would.  In her world, royalty has no advisors, and no other assassins.  And they take advice from assassins, and chum around with assassins, finding them nice people.  Because, they are nice guys!  Her books are popular, because she creates likeable characters and put them into interesting situations that people can relate to.  And then she adds a few fantasy elements, and kabam!  You got a story.  Not a really coherent plausible story, but people stop paying attention to the details because they LOVE the characters!  That is the ONLY way she could have gotten away with a book that talks about a lonely guy and his dog (sorry wolf) raising chickens in the middle of nowhere for hundreds of pages!  Oh, and it is TOTALLY logical to adopt a son?  A single parent with no job adopting a son?  Try something else, please 
 John Ames, the preacher-protagonist of Marilynne Robinson's Gilead, remarks at one point that in all his reading, what he has learned most is that "some very tedious gentlemen have written books." Indeed.   Unlike the deliberately slow-paced narrative of Housekeeping, the epistolary Gilead drags in other, less successful ways. As the aging Ames writes to his son, he attempts to chronicle his own life and gives us glimpses of his father's and grandfather's, both preachers in their own right. But as the elderly do, he tells the story haphazardly, the first hundred pages consisting almost solely of discontinuous ponderings and pithy religious truths. Ames admits, "I sometimes almost forget my purpose in writing this," and the reader grudgingly agrees, starting to wonder if even Robinson believes it when Ames says, "it is hard to make people care about old things."  Not that he doesn't try. For a pastor--and the book is pastoral in more ways than one--Ames can sound obnoxiously self-important ("Often when someone saw the light burning in my study long into the night, it only meant I had fallen asleep in my chair"). His efforts at conjuring religious imagery are riddled with mixed metaphors that often fall short ("Mary Magdelene probably made an occasional casserole, whatever the ancient equivalent may have been. A mess of pottage, I suppose"). Though exceedingly eloquent throughout, he also cops out in his most revelatory moments ("If only I had the words to tell you"), leaving the reader unfulfilled. Like the mysteries of godliness, the book simply leaves us to wonder, if only on something far less significant.  Still, there is balm in Gilead. Though Ames' antagonist (and namesake) doesn't appear until ninety pages into the book, this plotline's parallels with the prodigal son work better than others, and his appearance gives the book a direction that allows it to explore its more successful themes of home and healing. Somehow despite his meanderings, Ames finally brings us to a place where we sympathize with his plight and want to hear his life lessons as much as he needs to share them. If only he had gotten us there sooner 
 I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.    I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.    That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you.  
   The only problem is even though it's only a penny you'd still have to pay $2-$3 shipping. Not worth it! Funny book written by a sweaty little fat kid with crazy Christian conservative parents. Hearing a 14 year old virgin boy's opinion on abortion is great. And it's all yours for only one penny 
 I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor 
 This is a great magazine, but don't order it through Amazon.  They go through a third party (Snapse Magazine)that has terrible customer service.  I ordered this magazine in January and SIX months later... still no magazine.  I called Snapse twice and was told they had no record of the order (even though I received an email confirmation from Amazon and I have a 17 digit confirmation number).  They said they would research it and get back to me.  No one called or emailed me the status, so two weeks later I called them again.  They acted as if I had just placed the order and told me it takes 6 to 8 weeks to receive the first issue. I won't get my first issue until August.  Buyer beware... it could take SEVEN MONTHS before you receive your FIRST ISSUE.  
 I received emails about delaying my order three times. Since it showed that the product was available, I didn't understand why I had to wait less than two months to get my order. I was so disappointed by the Amazon this time! Doing business like that, I am not sure how long you will survive 
 I had high hopes for this book. I was sorely disappointed. The author kept going on and on with his theories about why the Roman Empire collapsed. Every time I thought he was about to get around to some IRISH history, he went back to Rome, or some other culture. I can understand setting the stage, but this was ridiculous. Halfway through, I gave up, skimmed the rest of the book, and decided it wasn't worth the time 
 The title of this book caught my attention, and the first couple of chapters made sense. However, I found that most of the advice offered boils down to imposing limits with the knowledged that teens are going to do whatever they want. His general approach seems to be for parents to accept what their children do instead of insisting on good behavior. His dialog is engaging and even funny at times. He doesn't offer much hope or constructive problem solving though. The cursing in the book was offensive to me as well, and that type of language would never be tolerated in our home. Acceptance of it as inevitable is unacceptable to me. 
 I purchased these in lieu of running a new phone jack to a bedroom.  It refused to work unless I was within 15 feet of the other unit.  The plug I needed to use is 60 feet away.  These units are a joke.  Netgear's technical support people are totally incompetent.  So, don't expect any help there.  I called, and the technician didn't even know they made this product.  Caveat Emptor 
 Grant's Dissector leaves much to be desired.  The dissection instructions are not all that clear nor are the drawings that great.  It seems to skip around a lot with the dissection.  It also mentions a lot of structures to look for which aren't in the drawings.  I would recommend the authors reconsider their layout.  I would also consider looking at other dissectors if you are looking to buy one 
 But after ordering it twice from Amazon, and having both arrive either defective or damaged, I give up on this stroller. First one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky - one side longer than the other - therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly. So we returned it to Amazon and were sent a new one. It arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway...put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it. Veered to the right, and after close inspection, once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up, probably during shipping. Also my 2 1/2 year old's head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is VERY heavy and hard to turn. (yes I knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn, etc.) Too bad, I really wanted to like this stroller, but I just don't have much faith in the company anymore 
 After reading about 130 pages I began to feel like I had already read this.  It reminds me a lot of The Corrections, though not as depressing or interesting...or good.  The parents--the children and their individual perspectives and lives and then a lesbian affair.  It's all been done before in The Corrections (and various other novels, come to think of it).  It's boring, really.  I didn't care for any of the characters, and even though I'm nearly finished with the book I still feel that they are two-dimensional.  The Thea and Anne affair was so predictable--a sure sign of a mediocre book.  I am only bothering because I have book group next Tuesday.  I wouldn't bother if you really enjoy a well constructed novel 
 I haven't read a Picoult book in a while because her formula was bothering me but I saw this in the airport and decided it would be a easy yet entertaining read for the tedious 3 hour journey.  It was entertaining to the extent that I finished it. Unfortunately - it was still formulaic and completely predictable.  Elements that I liked:   - Rape is very rarely easy to sort out and date rape cases involving drugs, ex-boyfriends and alcohol are especially difficult. The confusion and obfuscation that Picoult writes (whether that was her intention or just poor writing) surrounding the issue can be representative of an actual rape.    - Teenagers are notoriously melodramatic and self pitying and Trixie, though a little over the top, seemed like a typical teenager... the reaction of other students at her school to the rape and Trixie also seem plausible.   - I liked the graphic novel. The melodramatic aspects are typical of the genre and it was a great way to try and illustrate Daniel. The hidden word bit - hokey.   - I liked learning about the native cultures in Alaska. I would like to read a whole book that takes place there and explores the themes though maybe not by Picoult.   - I liked the idiot's guide to Dante that was incorporated into the book.  Things I didn't like:   - Picoult tries to incorporate too much into this book and thus wasn't able to fully develop it all. Though I liked the native Alaskan bit, it was too jumbled and it didn't really add to the plot. Like another reviewer I wasn't left with the impression that Daniel's haunted past resurfaced. I was expecting a lot more. Murder? That's too much to add to this already overburdened plot.   We lose threads here and there like Daniel's career and the wife's affair - he just disappears after his admission. Cutting is a very real phenomena for many young women and Jodi doesn't explain or develop it.  I don't know that it was at all believable. Could the myopic Trixie have had the wherewithal to make it to Alaska when she could barely see beyond her own break-up and tried to commit suicide multiple times?  The cop, the DNA analyst, the lawyers, the parents, the twist - I've seen them all before in Jodi's other books... it's part of her formula.  I wonder what would happen if Jodi spent maybe three or four years researching a novel and devoting time to its plot. She could excel in character development and careful analysis of difficult topics. I feel like this novel writing machine is doing herself, her readers and literature a disservice 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 Absolutely nothing new here.  And some points that made my eyebrows go up, to say the least.  Also, my copy had editorial problems in the Vitamins and Supplements section.  I've written to the editor to see if he'll send me a complete copy (I had paragraphs of text just missing).  But in terms of content, it was just old and tired and dull.  The book itself was a tough read and the tone, overall, was as if Clark were writing to the average walker trying to finish her first marathon.  There's nothing here you can't find at Runner's World or a million other magazines/web sites.  And I tend to think you can do better elsewhere.  I would not recommend it. 
 Flowery. Verbose. Rambling. Compound sentence upon compound sentence. This book was unreadable for me. I quit 
    A Virtuous Woman is a book by Kaye Gibbons and is about a woman named Ruby Pitt who meets a guy named Jack Stokes one day when he spots her sitting at a picnic table. She was much younger than he was and was raised much differently than he was.Ruby was a widow but ends up married to jack.Jack was so in love with his wife through everything they went through even when she was diagnosed with cancer.They were opposites and when Ruby dies Jack is lost without her.They seemed to have an unusual relationship in my opinion. It was actually really hard for me to keep reading each page as i went on.It just wasnt a story that kept me wanting more!and that is why i gave it only 2 stars. i didnt even want to finish the book and that is why i think it took me so long to read it.It really dissapointed me seeing as how i loved Kaye Gibbons first novel, ELLEN FOSTER.i think that another reason i didnt enjoy the book is that there were too many characters to keep track of and it made the book a bit confusing.i really didnt like the transition of chapters either. it was a bit unorganized.There was no action in this novel and i'm sad to say that i dont reccommend it to anyone really 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 The first Big Valley DVD collected every first season episode of one of the all-time best TV westerns. Unfortunately what we have here is only the first half of the second season, at the same price as the entire first season box set. There are, BTW, absolutely no "extras" included in this set to justify the much higher per-episode cost.  As huge a Big Valley fan as I am - it was my favorite TV western growing up, and still plays amazingly well for me today - I'd suggest holding off on buying Season 2, Volume 1. For one thing, I suspect we just may being seeing a complete Season 2 box set in the near future, especially if sales on this half-effort are poor enough. For another, Fox needs to get the message that such blatant money grubbing schemes will not work, we're too smart for that. Support such greedy efforts by buying this set, I can pretty much guarantee we'll be seeing more such from Fox, quite possibly with the entirety of the rest of Big Valley. Send the message we won't fall for it - and all they'll really understand is the bottom line - and it'll stop 
 The "ology" series started out as very fun and unique publications. This particular book and model set has little to offer comparatively.  Rather disappointing.. 
 Was really disappointed with this album. He needs to find something new that has the zip of Vincent, Crying  & American Pie. Old artists may need to just fade away if they are just a bunch of old men strumming boring new stuff. Bought this album because of the 3 songs that I mentioned. None of the rest made me want to listen more than once. 
 Back in 93 when this album dropped, people were saying that this album is a classic. I think the Source gave them a 4 or 4.5 for Buhloone Mindstate. Somebody please explain this record, 12 years later and I still dont get it. Anyways, top joints are Ego trippin and Breakdawn 
 I'm afraid not. I really don't like posting reviews like this, particularly because I am empathetic toward authors; however, I'm so disappointed in this purchase that I feel I owe it to others like myself who like the premise of a book about the friendship/s between women, and fall for cover endorsements that read: "Witty, pacy and immediately engaging." My opinion is the opposite. The opening is slow, confusing, crowded and dull. The writing style is not in the least bit engaging, but instead, challenging. It wasn't until page 30 that anything about the story or the characters caught my interest--and that, unfortunately, was short-lived.  American readers who read a lot of British literature are not lost or uncomfortable with British dialect. This was not the problem. The problem I had was with the one American character, Freddie, who even as a first year student in Oxford, didn't exhibit American vernacular. It was more believable 20 years down the road (when she makes the comment: "bloody hell, I really am English . . .") that you forgive her, but it bothered me enough to think the novel wasn't ringing true. The characters simply don't flesh out and extract sympathy or empathy from the reader.  I found this reading to be a waste of time. Sorry, cannot recommend 
 I really was interested in the topic of Arab history but found the writing so boring I had a hard time staying awake.  I finally gave up.  I would look for another book on this subject 
 After reading several books about the Founding Fathers and other Presidents, I was excited to read about Teddy.  Now in most books they discuss personalities, events, and impacts of decisions.  This book read like a cheesy novel with unncessary flowery language.  There are lines that were shown as dialogue, when the information was probably gleened from several correspondence.  He writes about facial expressions during conversations.  Morris even wrote about what they thought during events.  Most writers would state, "He would recall later..."  If I had wanted to read a novel, I would have.  I was disappointed not with the subject, just the way it was written.   
 This game is one hot mess.  I bought it for my Mom for Christmas.  We decided to play the 2 player game thinking it would be fun.  Well, the word my Mother used to describe it is "EXCRUCIATING".  This was the slowest and most boring thing I've ever played.  There is at least a 10 second pause between EACH function (choosing a case, opening the case, Howie giving you directions, taking turns, looking at your opened case. . .you name it).  Each time you switch back to the other player, THE SCREEN LITERALLY GOES BLACK!  You only see the suitcase girls in the beginning and the end.  When a case is opened, you only see two arms, breasts and the case!  When it is your turn to pick a case, there is COMPLETE SILENCE as you scroll - and I use the term loosely - up and down to pick a number.  For a "video game" which you assume to move quickly, you'd better set aside at lease an hour to play it.  You will be exhausted when you're through.  We suggest they go back to the drawing board and stop with all the pauses, play some theme music when you are choosing your case, show the girl who opens your case, have the audience clap - ANYTHING!!!!!!!!  If you buy this game, you only have yourself to blame. P.S.  I won $750,000 and didn't even care, I was just glad it was over 
 I've very disappointed with the game since I installed it yesterday.  It looks nice but the FPS portion is VERY poorly done.  You can sneak up behind an enemy, be 5 feet away, and still bloody well miss with your M1!  I don't think so.  Aiming down the sights is even worse, the weapon will bounce all over the place even at rest and crouching.  Like a previous gentleman, I own an M1 and M1 carbine.  They are VERY accurate.  The weapons in this game are poory modeling and it makes for a very frustrating experience.  The one good aspect of the game is the squad interaction.  The mouse point and click interface is much better than MOH: Pacific Assault's limited instructions.  I've also run into a few game glitches even with the latest patches.  Troops have disappeared from the play area even though the pictures are there and you can hear them acknowledge commands.  Again, frustrating.  I doubt I will even finish it now that I am past D-Day.  Overall, don't waste your money and wait until COD2 comes out.  
 Yes, some of us can remember the generation in Germany that stood up to those Jews, Czechs, and others.  But we can also remember that this generation accomplished little of value.  And that win or lose, they wouldn't have improved the quality of life for many folks.  Now there is a generation of Arabs that is willing to stand up to the Jews.  And maybe to others as well.  And once again, I can't see how this attitude is going to help anyone, win or lose.  While this book purports to see the Arab war against Israel from both sides, it basically faults Israel for not recognizing the suffering of the Arabs.  And I think this misses the point.  Even if the charges made against Israel were true, I think Israeli confessions would do little to make life better for Arabs.  The authors seem to praise (and boast about) racist Arab aggression against Israel.  And they say that sympathy for the Jews after World War Two is responsible for Israel's existence.  They thus imply that Israel's very right to exist is dubious.  But they do not point out that had there been no second World War (or at least, no slaughter of millions of Jewish civilians), Israel would still exist, and be quite a bit stronger (and very likely larger).  The authors dismiss the Six Day War as only having a price of seven hundred Israeli dead.  Well, they are right about the casualty figures.  They are some of the lowest in Jewish history.  They might want to look at Jewish casualties at other times when Jews were attacked in the past few centuries.  Do you suppose the authors would be so dismissive of an Arab victory if there were relatively few Arab casualties?  Rabinowitz and Abu-Baker say that Israelis are too self-righteous.  But even if they are, shouldn't the authors worry about the Arabs too?  Doesn't it matter how much Arabs value truth, justice, human rights, peace, or prosperity?  Or, for that matter, their own Arab Empire?  It seems to me that if the authors get their way, Israel will become just one more Arab state that discriminates against non-Muslims.  That's nothing to cheer about 
 First the bad news -- the Amazon product description is misleading. Well, flat-out wrong, in fact. This coffeemaker doesn't come with a thermal carafe. In reality, the carafe is very thin aluminum, like lightweight metal cookware that you buy for backpacking. So -- not just not thermal, but this sucker gets HOT when it's full of fresh coffee.  Also, it doesn't have a "permanent filter." It has a standard plastic swing-out filter basket, and comes with a reusable nylon filter. Nothing wrong with that (it's nice to get one packaged with the machine, actually) but the above description of a "permanent stainless-steel filter basket" isn't accurate.  The water tank maxes out at 28 oz., which is enough for two big (16 oz.) mugs at my house. Since I'm the only coffee drinker, this is fine.   On the other hand, it was as inexpensive as it is cheaply made. Despite the ridiculous, deliberately misleading retail price listed (as of March '07 as I write this, it says it retails for $85.99!) I got it for ten bucks plus shipping, and it's worth about that. Add shipping cost, and it was under $20, and it's programmable. It's worth noting that the programmable function turns off the hot plate after two hours, but if you use the coffeemaker manually you have to remember to turn it off yourself so that you don't, I assume, melt the cheap metal carafe.  It looks nice on the counter. It makes coffee. For me, it's a perfectly acceptable replacement coffeemaker that I bought on the spur of the moment when my previous machine broke -- but that's all it is, a temporary replacement. In this case, you get what you pay for, and I'm saving my pennies to get a better coffeemaker in a couple of months 
 While my tears flowed in several places throughout Souls Raised from the Dead, I found myself dry-eyed and skeptical at the end. Betts' novel of a girl on the cusp of adolescence diagnosed with kidney disease and  surrounded by a myriad of colorful adult figures could have been so much  more than the plot-driven surface treatment she gave the characters. Mary  Grace Thompson suffers from kidney failure, but Betts never tells the  reader what that involves. Only as the reader turns the pages do the stages  of dietary restrictions, dialysis, increased medications, and hope for a  donor become clear as the next steps. Betts' implied medical horror is only  a shadow compared to the black and white truth of medical reality. I would  have been happier knowing the clinical details; however, the in's and out's  of kidney failure were not the focus of this book. And therein lies my  biggest disappointment with Souls Raised from the Dead. The book's focus  was the cliched characters and their relationships--stoic father and  prickly, loving, daughter; selfish irresponsible ex-wife and two current  girl-friends with different needs and wants; self-righteous grandparents  and "white trash" grandparents who have a good heart where Mary  is concerned. Betts did not delve into their personalities enough to make  me emphathize with them. The dialogue was stilted, though some of the  one-sentence descriptions were poigniant. Betts describes Mary Thompson's  thoughts through the stages of her illness with clarity, though Betts never  shows how Mary's feelings of isolation, denial and detachedness affect her  relationships with her father or grandparents. Betts also delved into the  character of Tacey Thompson, Mary's paternal grandmother, and her struggle  with a faith contradicted by reality. Initially, I was prepared for a  wrenching story, but by the end of the book, I was annoyed with the  predictable plot and could easily visualize this as a made-for-TV movie 
 I've read 300 of the 362 pages and I can't be bothered to finish.  Not particularly well written.  The secondary characters are un-developed and annoying... in fact, the same can be said for the main characters.    I don't care what happens to them.  I don't care about finding out what the "mystery" is.  I can't figure out how they could possibly have fallen in love.  The author just springs it on you.  It's a bit insulting to the reader, in fact.    The heroine is passive and whiny... "[spies (or whatever) are following me and I'm going to do nothing about it except wait for them to spring on me at every tourist site and "ruin" the tourist experience for me.]"  This is my first book by this author, and unless I forget her name (it's a very bland, forgettable name) and accidentally buy something by her again, it is the last.  I'm really glad I only paid a buck for it 
 While some of his reviews are descriptive, some of the ratings he gives are freakin rediculous. This guy only gives Duvel 2.9, but gives Heineken a 3.4....what the? Duvel is regarded by many to be one of the best Belgian strong pale ales in the world, while quite the opposite could be said of Heineken.  I bought this book for 25 cents from the library, but it wouldn't be worth any more than that. You're better off spending your money on anything written by Michael Jackson 
 I work out 5 days a week so I would consider myself advanced.  This workout is definitely too easy for someone who is advanced.  There were a number of parts where I thought I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit.  It was very cheesy and the other girls in the video look like robots.  My DVD did not come with a band, which I thought was a real bummer.  The set and the music are boring.  I normally love Denise Austin, but this video was very disappointing.  I would instead recommend Shrink Your Female Fat Zones 
 We received our Kinyo UV-230C 2-way VHS rewinder/cleaner yesterday and tried it out today. The very first tape that we rewound (a much-loved Disney video) slammed against the beginning of the tape so hard that when we pulled the tape out it was hanging out of the cassette housing, crinkled. I'm afraid that repeated rewindings of a given tape could break the tape.  I had a blank T-120 tape so I put that in and fast-forwarded to the other end to see if it would happen in that direction. It did. I rewound that tape to the beginning and this time it ended properly, so this problem is not consistent.   The tape that was rewound initially was not a full 120-minute tape (the movie is 77 minutes long). I suspect that the sensors on the unit are calibrated for 120-minute tapes and will not necessarily treat shorter tapes as gently. (More tape = more weight = slower overall motor speed?) But I'm not going to experiment with tapes we want to keep! This unit will be returned ASAP. I may exchange it for another in hopes that this particular unit is out of whack. 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 I picked up this book expecting a nice, enjoyable historical fiction- what a dissapointment! If I had such a depraved mind I would certainly not advertise it.  This book is certainly not one to keep around if you have young children who are readers 
 My son was recently diagnosed, so I'm cruising and buying a lot of books ... and this one was recommended by the team that did my son's diagnosis.  But it was published in 1989!   There is so much new and evolving  information about autism that I would be very cautious about buying a book  even a few years old, let alone one that's over a decade out of date.. 
 I grabbed this volume from an airport bookshop hoping, as always, for a good read, but as well to learn a bit about a period of Chinese history that I have not read deeply in. Alas, Man's book fails on both levels.  Halfway through and the Mongols are conquering Asia. This part of the book is well written. Exactly why Genghis is the leader and why the Mongols are following him is left unclear. Indeed, after a rough childhood, being kidnapped and escaping Genghis emerges as head of the Mongols? Why? I do not know. The historical record here is probably sparse, but that is no excuse to skip over these years. They are pivotal to explaining why the Mongols emereged. Would the Mongols have emereged under another leader? Or, was it just Genghis?  The final third of the book is spent in Man's quest to find Genghis grave. The lack of any maps to go with the travelogue leaves this section quite confused. Then again, is Genghis's resurrection only to be seen in Man's hiking about the Mongolian woods?  Somewhere there is a good biography of Genghis and the Mongols, but this is certainly not it 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 This book is a very difficult book to use.  No index, bad alphabetizing of lists, no cross referencing.  It lists mostly high-end bottles, and ignores others.  It has pages of useless content. e.g. bottle club listings, bottle dealers, etc - all things that are out of date a month after publication and best found other ways.  That space could have been used for something useful, like an index.  I recommend this to no one 
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 I can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If you want a real rap CD then get one of the following. NWA - Straight Outta Compton Ice Cube - Amerikka's Most Wanted Dr Dre - The Chronic Snoop Doggy Dogg - Doggystyle Nas - Illmatic Tha Dogg Pound - Dogg Food Tupac - Me Against The World Tupac - All Eyez On me Tupac - Greatest Hits 50 Cent - Power Of The Dollar Biggie - Life After Death You get the picture 
 Rushkoff perused sfraves *the internet based mailing list* for about a year, hung out on hyperreal.org, read one too many copies of wired mag, and decided to string together a silly theory of "techno shamans".   while there may be some legitimacy, at least conceptually, to the merger of  technology, electronic music, and counter culture, it this book does not  reflect it.  this book felt like some rich, fat, publishing company sent  the youngest ad exec with 'kewl clothes' to check out 'the rave scene and  bbs's' and reported back what he found.   what he found were people like  him : poseurs trying to cash in on the next big thing.  too bad he was 2  years too late.  next time try reading 'altered states', or 'generation  ectasy' 
 As many other reviewers note, Shoumatoff's powerful writing and great  notes of research are really derailed in many parts here, beset with  numerous inaccuracies -- the parts on the Sonoran Desert and the O'odham  people, for example, as well as the Tarahumara and the Sierra Madre, beg  for a local copy editor. It's really a shame; there's a lot to like in this  book, and I would suggest reading it...but the usually astute Shoumatoff  has set himself up as a typical, loose cannon travel writer, coming to some  dubious conclusions about places he only knows as a short-sided visitor 
 Product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web. In addition, no "all region code" supportted! I will return it ASAP. 
 I am sorry to say, my expectations for this book were rather high I guess.  There just isn't much content in this book.  The number of illustrations are quite few and rather poorly drawn.  The text is as expected, mostly sarcastic and full of quip and clever rhetoric, however it comes a bit light when the authors attempt to grapple with the technical in describing the various bits.   Was expecting more.  Disappointed.  (the book didn't even talk about the Japanese submarine aircraft carrier, and that project actually did see the light of day 
 I felt the sample of this book was not a good indication of it's contents.  Most of the built-ins shown in the book are from a Room-View with the built in partially obstructed and with little detail shown.  I wasn't looking for plans to build, but I would have expected more.  If you like the details level shown on the cover of the book, then this will be right up your alley, other wise, the book will probably fall short of your expectations 
 I confess I bought this for 2 reasons, I treasure my copy of Damon Knight's proto-bio of Fort from the 70's, and wanting to see a contemporary re-examination of Fort's life & work; and the chance to read some new John Keel writing with the foreword.  I had then 2 realizations, Damon Knight's bio still stands as the only legitimate bio on Fort (who is worthy of far better than this mishmash) and a paragraph by Keel is often more insightful than entire books by others.  I'd read Bennett's "Looking for Orthon" and enjoyed it, an adept descriptive travelog of the saucer mania in the 1950's.  But this alleged study of the life, work & ideas on Fort is a travesty.  This book is more about Bennett's fortean awakening, his political education and his various axes he wishes to grind in public.  All in all, it's more about the author and less about Fort.  My conclusion- don't bother.  Get Knight's book through inter-library loan or out of print book services 
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 this is one of the most dissappointing items i ever bought for my son.  we set up the tank and nothing grew.  called the company for money back and they did nothing save your money because you might as well throw it down the toilet if you buy this item.  hope i have helped. 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 Many of the chapters seem to me to be written more to promote recall of isolated facts rather than understanding of the overall processes.  One of out medical school pathways uses this book and the students seem to lack the ability to synthesize informaiton.  I suggest the authors get help from someone with a real degree in physiology 
 I began my study of political philosophy with the best - namely Plato - so I suppose that when I began reading Aristotle's The Politics, I was optimistic.  That optimism didn't last.  I find that Aristotle takes many arguments for granted and ignores entirely others that would call into question some of his premises.  Often while reading The Politics, I found his analysis entirely lackluster, and his criticisms of The Republic, Gorgias and Laws (all by Plato) flawed or at least overly simplistic.  It's not that I'm incapable of appreciating the brand of philosophy Aristotle uses, after all I do consider myself more or less a realist.  But rather I did find it lacking of vision and insight.  Aristotle focuses on such parochial matters such as classifications of constitutions and mastery over slaves in the household versus statesmanship in the nation, that it never moved me or left me in deeply pensive state.  Ultimately, if you want to be truly inspired - read Plato, not Aristotle 
 Yet another example of someone invoking Christanity in order to sell a sub-par effort. This is the second time I have bought a book with Christian reference and the second time I have been ripped off. While this book has a catchy title, it is not worth opening. The title can be read for free. I highly suggest you stop there and save your money! 
 I bought this expecting it to be made of canvas, as in tent canvas.  This is more like the texture of a bed sheet.  It collapses if you barely touch it 
 I agree with an earlier review of this book. Nothing new here! Although the layout of this "Dummies" book, follows in the basic outline of all in this series, that is about the extent of the helpful content. It is obvious that the author is organized - as she practically refers back to her own talent in that area frequently. She must not have anyone in her life close to her that is of a different thought process. Namely - the unorganized. I don't believe that she undersands our mindset one bit.  If you want real help, keep looking 
 Harriet Lerner is an icon of self-help, something like Ann Landers.  Like Ann Landers most of her advice is just a recycled response applied to a different dilemma.  This book, like others of hers, strikes me as a repackaged version of her previous books.  Same anecdotes, same message, different title.    
 Did any of the 5-star reviewers actually listen to this? I suspect that Dane cook himself is the author of 75% of these positive reviews. This one stinks to high heaven! Avoid the noid 
 I bought this product based on independent reviews by consumer and PC magazines.  The product's performance was OK, but customer service was a headache.  The serial number on the CD that was shipped to me came up as "invalid" when I tried to install the software.  I had to call customer service, who gave me two more serial numbers before the software would accept one as valid.  Now, one year later I want to upgrade my software to the current version (to save $$ over a new purchase) and guess what?  My serial number is invalid and in order to upgrade via the Trend site I will have to pay more than what Amazon would charge me for a brand new CD.  I will most likely switch to ZoneAlarm because of the hassles involved in registering and upgrading this product 
 Apparently Martin Luther King disagreed...Yawn...Another tiresome politically correct diatribe written by someone who has clearly exhausted the possibilities inherent in writing essays on the homoerotic aspects of Gilligan's Island and the feminist subtext of Bewitched. Like most diatribes of it's kind, it hinges its indictment of Star Trek's racism on the most petty and ridiculous things and has no connection to reality but to the author's black and white version of reality. Star Trek fans should avoid this nonesense like the plague, while fans of academic essays on the Brady Bunch as a metaphor for Apartheid and the end of American nationalism will lap it up like spoiled chili 
 The pants are not Juniors', they are Women's pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them 
 As others note, Doudera is more concerned with clam festivals and kayaking than the nuts and bolts of everyday living.  The book is not impartial in the slightest; not one interviewee mentions any dissatisfaction in their Maine experience in a state where griping is the prime pastime.    I, alas, am not impartial either, having moved to Maine from Montana a year and a half ago to my deep regret.  If YOU must persist, however, I can provide some words of caution Doudera leaves unsaid.    The omission of two particular subjects is especially heinous.  First, though Doudera mentions that "on a map, the state appears to be sinking" from all the lakes and does recommend a home inspection, she completely elides the threat of flood or water damage.  This should be your top priority in a home search; any Mainer will tell you that nearly no house is without at least occasional water in the basement, and persistent water problems can rot support beams, unseat the foundation, and threaten the long-term stability of a home  -  not to mention make the basement unusable and foster mold.  Depending on the season, though, such problems might not be immediately apparent.  Check the road drainage; ask multiple neighbors; have your inspector take a second look.  FEMA flood zones are NOT a reliable guide.  Do not trust your realtor to the extent Doudera recommends; as Maine has nearly no consumer-protection laws, agents have no motivation to disclose such issues.    Secondly, if you venture off 95 or Rt. 1, you'll find that the roads are in a dangerous degree of disrepair, with asphalt like peanut brittle that's been cracked with a hammer.  This is due to a combination of wet soil refreezing and unfreezing during winter ("frost heave") and plain neglect.  There are also a great number of roads that turn to rutted, nearly untraversable dirt without warning.  Your car will see great wear and tear; you will go through at least one pair of struts per year (and I have heard of two or three).  Until you acclimate, drive VERY carefully to avoid serious damage.    Maine is also an extraordinarily fractious state.  There is no sense of unity on the state or county or even town-to-town level; the radio and even TV ads are rife with competition in trying to tear down neighboring locales as "trailer trash".  It's every man (and town) for himself, and this is a source of endless problems.  Rampant corruption and waste in state government goes unchecked, as there is no one city press strong enough to expose or counter it.  Taxes are extraordinarily high, as each individual village must provide near-completely for its own welfare and cannot take advantage of economies of scale.  Utilities are provided unreliably and at great cost, like teenagers performing chores poorly and with great folderol to impress upon us their displeasure at such unreasonable requests.  There are few charities or other means of community support; basic public goods like sidewalks or parks are relatively rare.  It is hard to make friends due to the lack of community functions.  If, like me, you took the concept of community for granted before, you won't after a year in Maine.  Other points:  - Maine's economy is tanking.  Few Mainers will dispute this.  In 2005, only Katrina-ravaged Louisiana had a worse outlook, a fact raised relentlessly by all sides in the 2006 elections.  Doudera cites the wealth of small businesses, but the vast majority are at-home side ventures.  For 40-hour-workweek employment, the average worker will have no choices beyond convenience stores and Wal-Mart.  - Many businesses  -  general stores and supermarkets, not just restaurants  -  cannot sustain year-round operations and are therefore "closed for the season", the "season" ranging from winter only to everything except summer.  This practice is not at all confined to resort towns.  A seemingly lively community in summer might get much less so at other times.  - Doudera expends a lot of space on puffins and moose.  The former are restricted to a few isolated islands.  The latter will not be seen unless you hunt up north; the highway signs are there solely for the tourists.  (Deer, as Doudera mentions, are a legitimate concern; take care when driving on densely wooded highways.)  - I cannot speak for health insurance, but my auto policy is relatively low.  Generally, though, prices are on par with Massachusetts (or, as Doudera mentions, California), particularly for food and health care.  (A recent eye exam cost me $170.)  - This might seem silly, but do not underestimate the effect the weather can have on your disposition.  If you come from a sunny state, Maine's chronic overcast will be a big adjustment.  - Winters in Maine are perhaps not living heck, though I have stayed for two exceptionally light seasons.  Listening to everyone TALK about it, however, going on and on in defeatist tones with gleeful hand-wringing at forthcoming divine meterological punishment, is plain unendurable.   - All but a few beaches are chopped up and privately owned.  Don't expect a community waterfront.  - Pollution is rampant from paper mills and factories.  The rivers are the color of used toilet water.      I complain, I know.  I wish, though, that someone had told ME these things before I moved.  I'll let you in on something positive  -  the absolute best fish in Maine is served at The Shed in Cornville, 10 minutes north of Skowhegan, where Rt. 150 meets Rt. 43.  Unfortunately, it might no longer be available by the time you read this; the proprietors are selling, for a new garbage incinerator is slated to be built just 5 minutes away.  You see what I mean 
 WARNING ... Watch these discs as soon as you get them so you can return them if they are bad. Don't trust that they have no visible scratches, I have discs that look perfect but when played have about 15 minutes that are unviewable on BOTH sides of the disc. Double sided discs are terrible quality, I don't think we have the technology to do this yet properly. The policy of a time limit at AMAZON.COM means you need to watch ALL the discs before I got a chance to watch more than the pilot episode, so when you order be sure you have about 22 hours to kill 
 Last year I used only this book to test out of AP physics B. I got a 5 on the test, so clearly the book did a great job. However, this year in physics C, I am finding that this book is awful, particularly for electromagnetism. It gives no examples using ampere's law and its covering of induced emf is absolutely awful. The circuit examples it gives are too simple and the practice questions never require the calculus derivations (such as ones using Gauss's law) that are covered on the C test. I would use it again any time for physics B, but am truly dissapointed that it is also advertised as a book for physics C 
 I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows.  I'm not, so I couldn't tell you.  Mediocre at best.  "This is Spinal Tap" was better 
 I'm with the reviewers who thought this book was ruined by the ending. I'm all for twists, but this was completely ridiculous and incongruous and dumb.  The book tells the tale of Hamptons small-time lawyer Tom, who had a brief career as a professional ball player. Apparently sometime in his youth, he dumped the woman he truly loved, Kate, who became a hard career lawyer in NYC. We know she's hard because she smokes, and has no friends, but in the end, they band together and find true love while defending a young black ball player from a multiple murder death-penalty charge.  It's twisting and turning and super derivative, but mostly it's satisfying. Until the last few chapters, when the writers throw in a major monkey wrench that turns the books into a joke.   I felt as if the entire reading experience was false, and a waste of time. Badly done. Cheap.   Patterson's books may not be the best, but they ususally don't make you feel this cheated 
 I expected much more from this book. I'm not really sure why, though, because we formerly used the Gallup test to select our  sales people. This could have been a good book. But the authors seriously miss the mark. They are clearly more interested in selling their own version of a sales test than giving sales people useful information. Most of the information they do share is not new. It's the same old stuff you get in Marcus Buckingham's Gallup sales brouchure also marketed as a book. The biggest problem with Benson and Rutigliano's book is the airy fairy untested psycho fluff they're trying to float as established scientific discoveries. The two authors are both Gallup's hired hands. They say successful salespeople are successful because they share one common trait. They "use their strongest aptitudes" to succeed in their work. "Strongest aptitudes?" Where haven't we heard that one before? What about intelligence and motivation and values and skill development? This book reads smoothly but won't work in practice. I know because we used to use the principles marketed in this book. But the selection mistakes proved too costly as we found out they also did for other users. Forget about the strenthfinder test this book touts. The book is an undisguised phising expedition for more people to take their sales test. But who cares? Does anyone still think you can trust surveys collected on the web? There are plenty of excellent books out there for sales people. Miller and Heiman, Tony Parinello, Spin Selling (one of my favorites), Dudley and Goodson (another favorite), Zig Ziglar, Huthwaite, these are the books salespeople should be reading 
 This book was not quite up to my expectations.  It was interesting but I felt the writer wasn't being totally honest about his rate of recovery since it conflicted heavily with his wife's view.  I actually liked his wifes diaries, they were very helpful in what the actual recovery process was.  I wouldn't highly recommend paying the money for this book 
 this book is a waste. the few simple recipes can be found in any monthly food magizine for alot less money. at best they are not even correct. example pg, 128 has you soaking dried cod for 1 hour. I can make many italian jokes about the procedure in the book. but cod, normally is soaked three days. unless you like a mouth full of pure salt with cardboard. of the more then 300 books I own this is the worst 
 Placed the order on 11/20, delivery was supposed to be by 12/9. On about 12/1 I contacted the company that Amazon said was the provider, Unbeatable Sale, Inc. to verify that they did have the order. Unbeatable said that it was an Amazon order, period, and gave me a number at Amazon to contact. Amazon said that Unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first.  Cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at Walmart. 
 I have three of her books and find the best one to be the backyard book and this one is good for the teaching and to get kids into of the cooking but some of them are a little hard for some if you don't bring all that you need to cook and she does repeet her shelf like she is looking for ideas or new food. In all I say its not bad for getting a dead line done 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 I ordered this CD after reading the two other reviews and was extremely disappointed; difficult to explain but it sounds like this guitarist doesn't really know what he wants to play, not improvising but hesitating  all the time and it's quite annoying; the guitar technique is not really  there either and on top of that the recording quality is awful. I must add  that I'm rarely negative; sorry this time 
 The first item I received was highly dented.  This is because the packaging is so inadequate for this type of item.  Since it was to be used outside, I sucked it up, figuring it was was easier than returning the unit.  Then the item dod not work, so i had to return it.  The next refrigerator I received was damamged again, but much less than the first one...and it worked...so, i kept it.  I read other complaints about the packaging of this item, but purchased anyway thinking it was over-stated...it's not.  Sanyo really needs to work this out as I am sure 90% of the refrigerators that are sent out become dented if they are all packaged the way mine were.  The fridge works fine...but does need frequent defrosting 
 obviously colin wishing(but not being) that he was an outsider. he has know idea what he is talking about.    he also thinks he has a right to say what is indifferent in scociety and what isn't. the truth of the matter is that the reason someone is an outsider is that the magority of people think the minority is strange. and it makes the magority mad at the minority because the minority doesn't or likes that the magority is mad at them.     so unless you want a good laugh dont by this assuption built upon assumption 
 This attempt at capturing the life of the Buddha missed the mark in my opinion.  While it is well researched and is most likely a sincere attempt of capturing the life of one of the most influential religious figures of all times, I don't think Karen Armstrong has a strong enough understanding of Buddhism from the inside to pull this off.  I found myself being annoyed at various points in the text, especially when she was commenting on the teachings of the Buddha.  This is because I don't think she really understands what Buddhism is about and she certainly doesn't come across as a Buddhist scholar.  I think the best short book on the life of Buddha that does convey the history and spirit of his message is Huston Smith's book on Buddhism.  You can also purchase a copy of the WORLD'S RELIGIONS by the same other and get this information and a whole lot more for about the same money.  There are many good biographers who have written about the life of the Buddha.  However, I can't say that Karen Armstrong belongs in this group.  I know she has written other good books, but I think she this was too ambitious for her and she was too far removed from the essence of the Buddha's teaching and culture to do it justice 
 After reading the reviews and synopsis here on Amazon (which is the same as on the back of the DVD), I thought that this looked like it would be a very good movie with a promising plot.  Within the first fifteen minutes, however, it was not at all as I expected.  First, the summary stated that Anna Manni (a police investigator played by Asia Argento, daughter of the director and one of the only redeeming features of this movie) was hot on the trail of a serial killer/rapist and would be captured because of an attack of the Stendhal Syndrome.  This is misleading because this actually happens early on in the movie (before any of her tracking him down is shown).  In other words, if you are expecting to see a movie about a beautiful, strong-willed police detective that is trying to capture a serial killer, this is NOT the movie for you.  Instead it is [mostly] a journey into the mind of a greatly disturbed (possibly psychotic) rape victim.  The overall quality of this movie is also not nearly as great as it's director's reputation.  This is my first Dario Argento movie, and it is a grave disappointment.  After hearing of the "Argento Genius," I really expected a movie with great editing, dialogue and at least a decent horror movie style soundtrack.  This movie instead is the opposite on all counts.  Finally, the style presented leaves a lot to be desired.  It is basically a mashing together of sci-fi, horror, drama, and even romance that doesn't quite work (some parts are so outlandish I could not help but laugh).  In short, save your money for a worthier movie that does not follow a flawed script to begin with, and that is not an attempt at such "stylistic" filmmaking. 
 Boy I had high hopes for this one. Coming off their best album, Shot, and produced by Gang of Four's Andy Gill, I was expecting a masterpiece. The opening track isn't half bad, but the rest is throw-away. Doesn't even  sound like Jesus Lizard. Go get Down or Shot instead 
 Ok, this was a kind of nice little book. But not really. The information inside of this book was VERY basic. It never went into details about betta housing (just kept on referring to betta bowls, tiny little bowls in which a betta WOULD NOT be happy in). So thats what took away some starts, was the lack of useful information.  This book had a lot of pictures. Pictures are all well and good, but not in this book. Most of the pictures were of older, boring 'veil tail' finned bettas. Those are bettas of the past. Now we have half moons, and crowntails, so much better. But there was one image of a half moon, and one or two of delta tailed bettas. So the betta community was not represented in the least by this book. Just old veil tails.   Overall, not a good book. 
 Many years ago I enjoyed reading Ivins' columns but unforunately her brand of independent liberalism has turned into just another mainstream media voice parroting the Democrats. Her personal hatred of George Bush has become distracting and embarrasing. Strangely enough she reminds me of Rush Limbaugh. When he began doing political commentary on the radio Limbaugh was an independent with a conservative streak and was comfortable attacking Republicans. Similarly Ivins was originally an independent with a liberal streak who was comfortable attacking Democrats. Now Limbaugh is as firmly ensconced in the Republican camp as Ivins is in the Democratic camp.  What a shame 
 Unlike other reviewers, I found this book to be muddled and the metaphors to be over-used to the point of uselessness. At one point, the author compares early human migrations to "...squeezing toothpaste from the tube, where climate is both the carrot and the stick in the scenario." I'm not kidding. These two completely different analogies in a single sentence exemplify the superfluous use of metaphors that bogs down the text. Wells would have done better to spend more time on explaining genetics and human prehistory directly, rather than using metaphors to excess. I also question whether this book is truly accessible to the average science reader. I have a doctorate in molecular biology, and I sometimes had to fill in gaps with knowledge from my own education.  From a scientific perspective, Wells includes genetic results from studies of both the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, as well as anthropological findings. This is important, as no single angle will tell the complete story of human evolution. He seems to forget this, however, when he claims that the Y chromosome provides a more accurate view of human migration and evolution. This really only holds true for human males, despite what he says about "sexual politics".  I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone. Nevertheless, the use of genetics in understanding human prehistory remains a fascinating topic, and if you are interested, I would refer you to the many works of Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Brian Sykes 
 I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys.  Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly.  As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as "Curtis."  As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies.  This was very distracting.  I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book.  The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful.  Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics.  Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF.  This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman.  
 On the Far Side of the Mountain is about Sam Gribley, who lives on the Catskill Mountains. He eventually is also burdened with his sister living there, and must leave the safety of the mountain to save her with his friend Bando.  This book has some action and adventure, but not enough for my taste. I didn't appeal to that or the characters. It was basically about outdoor survival, which is much better done in other books, like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.  I would recommend reading other, more exciting books, like Hatchet,instead of this one. 
 This is a must read for every teacher of young children! Paula Polk Lillard is right on target on her observations of children and how the teacher can assist them be the best they can be 
 If this had been a movie, it is my belief it would have gone straight to video.  It only came out in hardcover because the publishers knew Ms. McDarmid's name would sell, no matter how very awful the book is.  It's hard to believe that the author who wrote A Place of Execution, a truly brilliant mystery novel, could also produce such drivel as Killing the Shadows.  Cliched (this is the break we've been waiting for!) and cluttered with poorly written "romance", this book is the written equivalent of a teenage slasher flick.  Serial killer running around and all the potential victims acting as stupid as humanly possible 
 I purchased this book with good intentions and have never written a negative review on a book, but I had to go out of my way to make note on this book. Although I can see how others could find value in the book, the author lost his credibility with me after two chapters of me underlining statements he was making that he stated as fact when they were just his opinion. I won't get into every detail, but for example he classifies real estate investors as short-term, mid-term, or long term and then states "the long term investor won't care about purchase price" (what is he talking about?) and then fails to understand the fact a long term investor can capture appreciated gains through monetizing the asset (i.e. the house) through additional equity lines or refinances, rather than state this simple fact which is very important as it would allow a long term investor to avoid transaction costs and tax implications but still receive cash from the appreciation he states the long term investor will hold the home not very leveraged; that is totally untrue many long term investors are highly leveraged and continually borrow against their properties and appreciation. Anyway, not a big deal but atleast he didn't call his book the "Bible to Real Estate Finance" or something like that because it is not. It is a great subject matter and topic and he stated he may be one of the few people to have written a book on this narrow topic for a lay person, but the book lacks a professional polished work; take it for what you can get out of it and question things 
 It seems that these recipes were written by either mothers of college kids or 70 year old sophomores. Two recipes for LIVER? Come onnnn. Most of the recipes have 6 - 9, even 14 ingredients. A coed is never going to buy so many ingredients called for in this book, let alone a guy. I bought this for my niece and I decided to give it to her as a gag gift, writing my own takes on some recipes. They may taste delicious (except the liver) but even I don't want to take the time 
 Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless.  Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates.  So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt.  If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use.  The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine.  
 This item was purchased as a gift and I was very unhappy when I received the item. The box it came in was very bent up and the top of the box would not even close properly. The flashlight was missing the cord to hang it from and it was hard to get to work after following the directions. I would not buy this product again 
 Bought this for daughter for Christmas, and when I opened the box and saw the cardboard backing, debated on returning it. But they love the Pegasus Barbies, so figured okay, let's try it out! Is really beautiful when all put together, and my daughter LOVES it! But, that stupid cardboard backing. Nope, no way does it stay on at all. Am going to tape it to the wall behind the playset, and it will be fine. Right now is just standing up behind the set. Really, couldn't they have made a plastic piece with a big sticker with clouds/pegasus horses on it that attached to the back?   When assembled, the whole thing will fall apart if you literally move it a couple inches.  My 3-year old daughter understands this, not to move it, and so far she has been fine with it. I showed her myself moving it and it falling apart, and said see, don't move it, okay!?   But when it comes apart, is very easy to pop the sections back together - which in my house, the kids play with toys for a while, and then I like to put things away in the closet for a bit - which this I can easily break down some of it to store, and then in seconds have it snapped back together again to play with. Yes, durability-wise is a piece of junk - but a beautiful piece of junk, and is worth it if your child loves the Pegasus Barbies 
 Despite what the tag line promises, this is not an epic story of WW II's most dramatic mission.  It is ridicuous to even suggest such a thing.  At best this is a superficial recounting of a late war mission which turned out not to be not nearly as dangerous as it could have been.  The bravery of the men who took part in the raid cannot be questioned.  However, there are countless other tales of WW II that recount much more horrificly dangerous events than the one depicted here.  The book simply fails to deliver.  If you are looking for a gripping tale of the horror and heroism that defined WW II this is not the one 
 I am writing this over a year after actually seeing CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE, because it was the first time I could stomach to remember it.  I am a hard core indie-scifi freak (well any good scifi really) and I must say this movie was a train wreck.  I couldn't believe the film makers sheer lack of understanding as to what made the original CUBE great- all white rooms, street clothes, time traveling canabal, I'm saying.  I considered CUBE to be up there with the greats (Donnie Darko, Dark City, blah blah blah), CUBE 2 just cheapened it.  If you really need more Cubedom see CUBE ZERO the prequel tney recently made, it's at least decent.  But to this monstrousity just say no 
 My seven year old nephew could have done a better editing job. If the text weren't such a compilation of useless nonsense, I'd say the Paladin editor (if there actually is one)owes Mr. Benson an apology. This book was so horribly put together (misplaced paragraphs, missing words, sentence fragments, etc.) I almost want to believe that this was a vanity printing. If so, I hope the author didn't pay too much 
 As a writer for Collector's Weekly magazine, Molly is being exposed to all kinds of new art.  This particular day, she is accompanying her mother to a kiln opening for a Southern potter.  While her mother gives her tips on what to expect, super collector George-Bradley Straunton arrives.  George-Bradley is hated by all the pottery collectors in the region for his lack of regard for anyone else.  So when he drops dead, it's hardly a surprise.  The police quickly rule it natural causes, but Molly isn't so sure.  Poking around, she finds plenty of motives and proof that it was murder.  But who had the opportunity to commit the crime?  The book is a fast read because it's only 200 pages.  That's the only positive as far as I'm concerned.  The plot moves along sluggishly with frequent interruptions to talk about the antiques.  And don't get me started on the climax.  I absolutely hated it.  The most interesting character was the stereotypical gay guy.  The rest left much to be desired.  The writing needed some polish as well.  I recently read another book by this author and enjoyed it.  And many others here seem to have enjoyed this one.  I don't recommend it, however 
 Heard a lot about the movie and was looking forward to seeing it. Then I got the dvd...could not play in my dvd player...Not sure why, so I watched it on my computer.  Only to find someone had taken out all the nasty or blurred it out.  I would of liked the movie much better if I could of seen it without the cuts and it would have been nice to see it on my tv.. 
 This video is so not worth the price! It is stills or ONE george book being read by a narrator and some other non Curious george stories as well. Buy you child the Movie they just made and the Zoo DVD which is what runs on PBS. I'm sure there will be more George on DVD in the furture 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 Don't buy this book, please! The man is a complete fake. He's degrees are totally worthless. He is making money off of people looking for help and tricked into believing his marketing hype. Just do some research on Google and you'll discover the truth about him 
 If you're really hard-up for a laugh, you might like this flick. But you'll also have to be happy with the following qualities: Slapstick, stupid, forced humor, poor acting, mediocre dialog. It's obviously low budget. And it just isn't funny, which is bad since it's suppose to be a romatic comedy. Don't buy it. And don't waste your time renting it. Try Mambo Italiano instead 
 This one got way too much attention from NPR. I loved the interview there with the author, but, quite frankly, his entire story was told in that very sitting. This "book" is really an "essay" that doesn't deserve all the paper it's printed on; I would've been much more appreciative of this author's sentiments had it been marketed more appropriately 
 I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short. Did I learn my lesson? Oh, no! I went ahead and purchased another Clapper some months later. The night before last, the lamp I connected this one to started blinking. I checked the lightbulb and it was OK. It was only went I got down close to the Clapper plugged into the outlet that I heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity. Once again the Clapper crapped out, this time in a different lamp, different outlet. Will I never learn? Thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device. Can you say "housefire"? Again, how dumb am I? Is the unit UL-approved and, if so, have any other complaints been lodged about it? How does one find this out? I like my gadgets, but "buyer beware" on this one 
 This is the worst remake i have ever seen hands down. Woefully miscast with none of the creepy atmosphere and classiness of the original, this film belongs in the scrap heap 
 I am an avid reader, and I will finish a book no matter how difficult it is, or how boring it is, and I couldn't finish this one. It was so dry - and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I was really disappointed 
 I purchased this book after finding out they were tied to a large company that provide detailed plans as well.  Later, I find that the plans you are sent for the ADDITIONAL $75.00 are complete junk.  The company the book also refers to, is out of business, and all the out of spec/code/date plans are from another company.  The book is absolutely USELESS to anyone that wants to look and pick out building plans.  It belongs in the recycle bucket 
 How could a great director like Tim Burton take a concept that is slam dunk good and change it so much as to kill it this bad. While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest. Talking humans did in the series and this movie as well. The apes come across as just cruel hunting and killing speaking animals and this sinks this turkey fast. A real let down and waste of tim 
 This movie isnt worth the time to read this review. It sucks and I'm a big Trinity fan. My advice is keep searchin 
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 not what I was expecting from him. Everyone out there knows Boney is a fantastic saxophonist. However, this album left much to be desired. I wonder why he left Paul Brown, his former producer. He released some excellent albums with Paul brown. I don't think he's doing well enough on his own. I did not find any track particularly mind-blowing. If anyone that really knows boney doubts this, perhaps you ought to listen to "seduction" and "sweet thing" before making any comments. This latest album is nothing compared to those two. woork harder boney. I would not advise anyone new to Jazz to buy this album. 
 I'm reading some of the recent reviews and most of them are 5 star reviews. I wonder if they ever sat down and listened to the album or are they aware if Jay-Z is capable of much more.  Anyway Jay-Z's fourth album Vol.3: Life And Times Of Shawn Carter is a semi-decent album at best. In 1999, Jay-Z was possibly enjoying the mainstream status of his career, to the point that he has been lacking on the microphone. He hasn't improved since Vol.2: Hard Knock Life. His rhymes seemed to be slapped together, as shown in the second track "So Ghetto" with rhymes like "Jigga man, Volume 3/I'm back looking like me/stop the presses/ladies drop your dresses." Some tracks just fall flat on the ground like the Mariah Carey assisted "Things That You Do", and and the weak hook on "S. Carter". Awkward moments are on this album like Dr. Dre appearing on the song "Watch Me" as Jigga doesn't shine lyrically on the track. "Come And Get Me" could have been shortened and condenced to three verses, since I've ever heard Jigga do a solo song lasting longer than 4 and a half minutes. Amil, Beanie Sigel, and Memphis Bleek colab with Jay for "Pop 4 Roc" and that fails causing me to loose my attention towards it.  Now there are some good songs on this album though. The first single "Do It Again (Put Ya Hands Up)" was probably a club banger back in late '99/early 2000 with the help of Beanie Sigel. "It's Hot (Some Like It Hot)" Jay turns to his lyrical side and it works somewhat on the better side on this track with rhymes like "I'm about a dollar, what the f*** is 50 Cents" (a response to 50's "How To Rob"). UGK hooks up with Jay on the hit single "Big Pimpin" that is one of the standout tracks (If you remember when it was on the radio/television, Jay had an extra verse, that is not on the album). Mostly the production on this CD saves it from being a failure. "Snoop Track" featuring Juvenile is one of those tracks that carries a good beat.  The bonus tracks "Jigga My N****" appeared on the Ruff Ryders first comp album and "Girls Best Friend" appeared on the Blue Streak Sndtrk. A couple of bonus songs that are better than the ones on the album.  As I said before Jay-Z is capable of doing much better. Many Jigga fans want to hear the same man that was on Reasonable Doubt, and this album is far from what that is. The production saves this from being a complete failure in my opinion. Luckly Jigga stepped his rhymes back up on future albums. If you want to hear more Jay-Z or you have never bought this album and are curious, I recommend this to you. Otherwise pick up other Jigga albums.

 This book is one big regurgitation of tired feminist anti-man dogma from an author who apparently has not the first clue about his subject.  I'm sure it will be well received by pseudo intellectual feminists wanting affirmation of their own misandrist prejudice, but anyone else would be wasting their time.  In a footnote to the prelude the author thanks "especially women" for providing him with information about dominant men.  He extensively cites folk customs of a particular subdivision of Algerian people and extrapolates that into a general condemnation of men and western society in general. On every page are unsupported misandrist assertions and prejudicial rhetoric.  It reads like a poorly written parody of a KKK lecture on relations between blacks and whites, except its about men and women, and he's serious.  The author beats around the bushes filling the book with page after page of common feminist hate propaganda, and then finally gets around to his real message in the Appendix, which is about "the gay and lesbian movement."  Not that he hasn't used a lot previous references to gay sexual domination though, it's in every chapter.  Apparently a gay author, he finally reveals why he has no experience or understanding of normal relationships between men and women, and why he's willing to publish anti-male dogma that promotes disharmony between women and men. If it belongs on a bookshelf so does the testimony of the Aryan Nations, the KKK and the National Socialist party.  Misandrist feminists will all like the book and vote "not helpful" to this review 
 Very cheaply made.MY children broke it after only four months.The back wall broke off along with the top roof.The furniture also broke.The people's hair came off.This house was a big mistake.I wish I had purchased a different one.This house is very cute,but not sturdy enough for preschoolers 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long.

 Don't buy this piece of junk! Thier voices are computerized and they wern't supposed to become a real group! Cheetah Sisters is really annoying,Cinderella is awful with those "OOOHHHHS" over and over!Play is better at this song! Girl Power gets really old and boring with the video being played over and over on Disney.Together We Can,even 7 year olds skip it. C'mon,No, No, No not rap!!!! Sonic Chaeos are more annoying then the Cheetah Girls, I give 1 star because of Hope 7's "Breakthrough" is kind of rock.End Of The Line is too sad and 1 minute long. Girlfriend is just too awful to mention!The Special edtion with the remixes is more fun and makes the Ep better.So if you really want to listin to these girls buy the special edtion and skip the first 8 songs 
 If you're familiar with Gerald May, you know he's spent the past couple of decades searching through the world's different spiritualities to find "authenticity" for life, so it's not surprising he's finally stumbled upon Catholic mystics. And it's also not surprising that he's worked hard to recast John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila in his own image, removing the most important aspects of their lives, which is Jesus crucified (he's called "John of the Cross" for a reason, you know).  This is not a book that portrays these two mystics accurately, nor does it put forth any form of orthodox Christianity, but is just one of the many dumbed down versions of New Age Christianity out there claiming that "God is nada, no-thing" (page 179) and that John of the Cross was not seeking "any specific image of God" for "It is neither the name (God, Allah, or Krishna) or the man (Jesus or Buddha) that is the final object of [man's] loving desire." (ibid)  And he concludes with the unhelpful advice "that's the devil of it; there is no way to know for sure. All we can do is hope for the dawn." In reality, John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila both knew for sure, even in their darkest nights - they couldn't see it, they couldn't experience it, they couldn't feel it, but they knew, and in faith continued on anyway.  Anyone really interested in these two saints' thoughts and experiences would be better off getting the Kavanaugh or the Peers translations of their works (available for free online or in cheap paperback editions) and working through them personally. 
 I feel like maybe I missed something, given all the hype that surrounded this book. But I found that it didn't seem to add much to the subject matter: it seemed like a rather weak summary of the explorers journals. I keep feeling like I would have been better reading the primary source material or a different survey of that material. I like Ambrose's other works and am a avid history reader, but this one really feel short. The subject matter may simply not as suited to Ambrose's style. Someone like Robert Kaplan (Balkan Ghosts), Rebecca West (Black Lamb and Grey Falcon) or William Dalrymple (From the Holy Mountain) would have done a much better job of weaving in what Lewis and Clark were seeing and experiencing within the context of their times and pulled in additional material to illuminate the subject matter. 
 I owned the original VHS version...I quickly gave it to a friend of mine, free of charge.  Eric Johnson may be considered a guitar great (I don't get it), but he has the personailty of a shoelace and it is aptly demonstrated in this instructional video. Some people just aren't good teachers, no matter how great a guitarist they are.   As an added bonus, his guitar is drenched in reverb throught the entire video, even during specific examples & demos! Say what?  Finally, the length of the video was way too long (or at least it felt that way. It took repeated viewings for me to get therough from start to finish).  Throw in a mind-numbing finale/lecture about patch cables, cable length, pick gauge, strings, theories on physics and you get Eric Johnson: Total Electric Guitar - Agonizing to watch & absolutely God-awful.   Stick w/ Brian Setzer (THE rockabilly instructional bible), James Burton (Hello.....Elvis' guitarist!), Yngwie J.(THE only instructional video you need for precision shredding), Danny Gatton (1 & 2: encyclopidias of all styles) or B.B. King: Bluesmaster (extremely in-depth analysis/demos of B.B.'s style by B.B.) Instructional videos/DVDs. Even if it's not your style, these are highly informative, educational & entertaining. I highly recommend these 
 If it were really serious postmo scholarship, it would be a bit more honest about its starting points and sources (namely, Deleuze, Guattari, Baudrillard, Lyotard). Certainly an edition edited for America should have more bibliographic information. On the other hand, this book should prove largely inaccessible to the bestselling audience who have bought it and tried to read it (Michael Moore this isn't). That's because they will lack the background in philosophy and the 'superstructuralist' approach to social theory. To conclude, at least I'm honest enough about the book and with myself: having waded the whole way through the book, I'm still reluctant to give it a great review simply because I feel proud about getting through it. It actually made me, after a 20 year hiatus, want to start reading long works of fiction again.  I think Negri might be a highly original thinker--back in the 1970s. I also think he is simply wrong in most of his analysis and predictions. In short, because the book 'Empire' really doesn't deal well with US hegemony, I don't see it as a very serious academic book nor can I take it as a 'how to' manual for living a 'radical' life. Finally, much has been made of its pedantry, obscurantism and academic style. Please note however, that it is not really in the sort of academic style expected in American scholarship. If you have read in the so-called 'continental' traditions in philosophy and social thought, the book is not really that pedantic or obscurtantist. It's still mostly wrong in its analysis, however interesting a certain American readership might have found it, even though they do not usually read European thought in any systematic way.       
 i ordered this necklace thinking that it would be small and dainty.  it is actually quite large and cheap looking.  i was really disappointe 
 I picked this set up despite reservations (reservations being Luke Perry and the guy from the Cosby Show) because of the creator J. Michael Straczynski. Unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff.   It's really nothing more then a C average show. Normally that's not a big deal but when you consider this is on a premium channel (Showtime) and costs over $70.00 on DVD it's just not good enough.   Specific problems I had with the show include a lot of filler episodes. The season is only 18 episodes long and at least half are stand alones that contribute nothing to the overall story line. The show would have been better off with only 12 episodes all geared towards a single over riding story (this is the model that HBO uses).   Production value is also sorely lacking. Once again I'm going to compare to HBO (I feel this is fair since these are both pay to view networks). The HBO series Carnivale has unbelievable production value, the set's, locations, costumes and visual effects are all motion picture quality (the same can be said for Deadwood and Rome but Carnival makes for a better comparison). But Jeremiah all looks the same. You can tell the show was all shot in the same location, every back road and town look like they are in the same county.  The biggest problem however is just the premise. A post genocidal virus world populated by orphaned children seems like a good idea but in practice it get's tired fast. I had to force myself through the last 9 episodes. Luke Perry's quest to find Valhalla sector fails to add any intrigue or mystery. Simon's quest to rebuild civilization also comes up flat and any moral or social lessons conveyed are thinly veiled. So basically it is neither exciting nor intelligent. Plus if you need any other reason to dislike this show then know that Jason Presley makes a guest appearance (just what this show needed a 90210 reunion).  If you're looking for a great show this is not it. If you can watch it cheap give a whirl but don't waste any hard earned cash on this one 
 I was very excited about 'Victim in Victoria Station' and could not wait to get started.  However, I was soon disappointed.  The reason for Alan not being there was very contrived and I cannot imagine anyone rushing off to  keep an appointment after her experience on the train. There were too many  characters in the office to keep track of, especially since they were not  very relevant to the story.  The murders and motives are never explained,  yet we are taken ad nauseam through endless (fruitless?) late night  searches.  Not one of the best in the series. Missed the hats as well,  although I did enjoy the red one near the beginning 
 The basic information in this book is invaluable, but the Author's style resembles that of high school student. The book is written in a classic outline style (I'm going to talk about this now), it's impersonal and has cold examples. Dr. Tannen doesn't seem to give much if any of her own realizations, instead she consistantly refers to other experts. I constantly felt as though I was reading a report written for a social psychology class 
 Yesterday, i was in a DVD store when i ran into this. As i had enjoyed the first movie quite a lot (and despite the second one which was awful) i decided to buy Cruel Intentions 3. Back home, i sat on my coach and started to watch... After 5 minutes, i was already wondering why on earth i had spent money on such rubbish. This movie has nothing in common with the first one or the second one. It's the story of Katherine Merteuil's cousin, Cassidy (which doesn't have the class of Katherine and dresses more like a hooker), and of a friend of hers, Jason (played by Kerr Smith, seen in Dawson's Creek). Bye bye the luxurious mansions and appartments in New York and the picnics in Central Park... The story is here set in California, under the palm trees. The characters are sticky, insipid and unclassy. The movie goes in every direction. There are no surprises at all, everything is clear from the beginning. It's the very first time i'm so disapointed by a DVD i buy (and i have quite a lot...). Do NOT buy this ! It's worth nothing !!!! 
 I have listened to this cd many times and every time I listen to the single it just makes me mad.  The album version is a lot better and I wonder why Moby would want join forces with Gwen.  The cd's version is unbelievable and I was happy to hear it become a single.  I did not like Moby teaming with Gwen.  Buy the cd and see how much better Moby as an artist.  The music is much better and worth the money 
 I'd love to be able to give this book a five star rating, since conceptually it is just what so many parents need to fortify their children's education.    But anyone who would call Elizabeth I "England's Greatest Queen" has a decidedly Protestant, "Whig" view of history.  Christian readers should know that "Good Queen Bess" formalized her father Henry VIII's violent separation of England from its historic ties to Christianity and made martyrs and outlaws of the realm's leading intellectual lights, e.g., Edmund Campion, William Allen, etc.  It kills me to give a project with such a noble ambition a paltry two stars, but the last thing we need is another set of history books lionizing one of history's great despots 
 I like the style of shoes but It really troublesome for me. It get dirty so quick and hard to clean it. If I knew about it, I wouldn't buy it. the color of black trim will come out so easyly when it touch with water. After that, it makes the leather dirty and so hard to clean it.  Just dont wear it when it is raining. Any way, I hate to clean it everytime 
 I really liked 'True to Yourself'. Not the most original material, but the guy's got at least the pretense of a stile of his own. It had great guitar and good singing. So I was really disappointed with this album. It's not just more of the same -- it's difficult to distinguish most of the songs on this record from each other, and they're all sticky from the clichés. The real problem though is that his singing style is brought to an extreme here. He's become a parody of himself. To the point that I get annoyed listening to some of the songs (I can't listen through the whole of "I'm on my way"). His guitar playing is still awesome, though 
 This is a terrible, terrible film.  It's incredibly boring, lame, tedious, filled with bad acting, bad direction, etc., etc..  I know it was very popular at the time, but it still is really awful.  I had a difficult time sitting through the whole thing, and it was rather sleep inducing.  I wanted to see at least one of the Friday the 13th films, so I watched this one.  Many of the murders were ripped off from Mario Bava's superior Twitch of the Death Nerve (aka Bay of Blood), so the film wasn't even that original.  As we know, there were roughly around 1000 sequels, 500 TV shows, Jason dolls, Jason's official murder tools, Jason's hockey mask, etc., etc..  The film was one of the biggest hits of 1980, the year Hollywood started to decline.  Coincidence?  Who knows?  I just know I wasted 90 minutes of my time...

 Certainly a nice looking book.  From what I understand, Marvels launched the careers of its two principle creators, and it's definitely not a bad place to start.  Alex Ross's work is nothing short of spectacular.  His art is the closest comics will ever come to fine art, and demands respect.  However, I cannot give this book a glowing review because it failed on a very base level.  It failed to pull me into the Marvel Universe.  Sounds odd, I know.  But as a man in my early twenties with little to no understanding (or appreciation) of the Marvel Universe, I'm left in the dark.  I could easily understand why an older man, or a Marvel Comic enthusiast, would love this comic, but as a newcomer, I was left behind.  There is a very fine difference between inventing a concept, and perfecting it.  Marvels serves as the prototype for future masterpiece Kingdom Come, which also featured an everyman POV.  Naturally, there's a frustration on my part that comic creators often make allusions or other nostalgic call-backs to the Silver Age of comics.  This is problematic for comic readers who, like myself, have no intimate knowledge of that bygone era.  And from what I've read of it, there's not a lot that impresses me.  Do not buy this book unless you are very much aware of Marvel's content history.  Otherwise, you'll be left scratching your head.  (God only knows what was happening during that Galactus bout. 
 Uninteresting recipes, uninteresting writing. So uninteresting in fact that I skipped whole pages and sections and never found out if she even got around to explaining that the word taco means wadding or wedge, such as the wadding that used to be used to stuff cannons. Visual image, stuffing a taco "wad of food" into your mouth.  The praised Delfina's tacos, which are a guisado of ground beef, onion, sweet peas, salt pepper and comino stuffed into a softened with oil tortilla and bake until crisp,well, it's an interesting recipe that I haven't seen before but a lot of work for not very much of a pay-off in flavor.    Reading the book reminded me of times when I would be stuck having to listen to someone ramble on about whatever, and not having a means to extricate myself from the situation.  Fortunately, in the case of the book, all I had to do was close it and shelve it 
    I really enjoyed reading this spectacularly written book.  
 If the church is our example of marriage Christ LOVED us first. He did not need to be respected first. I agree with the main idea of the book, however the author puts more pressure on women than on men. Men, lead the way in love as Christ did, even when he received no respect but crucifixion 
 This will probably be the last volume in this series I will buy. There are two or three decent episodes here, but already you can see the emergence of the "What got aboard this time?" cut-rate storytelling that eventually doomed "Voyage." In many cases the writing is so hackneyed that character motivations are simply ignored, leaving some show conclusions way up in the air.  Of course, the special effects are still marvelous, even though the same underwater shots are frequently reused. Basehart and Hedison do their best, but by late in the second season the cast had been cut back and Irwin Allen was really playing his big audience for suckers. Of course, he pretty much made a career of that. Even so, I guess I'm still a sucker for "Voyage," which I have loved since the sixties 
 These books are a good idea for the repeat visitor to a city-- basically just a place for notes in the lovely (I think) Moleskine format.  The maps, though, can be found better and cheaper on other places.  MORE IMPORTANT,  this seller has claimed a falsely inflated list price and consequent discount that is misleading.  The list price for these books is 17.95.  Check in any book store.  Shame on the seller 
 The writing and story are disjointed and the grammar of the author is horrible.  I'm not even talking about the quotes of individuals involved, but the author.  I'm on page 84 and don't think I'll finish this book.  It's too painful to read, and not because of the story it tells 
 Sorry every one but I think this movie was so dumb. Jamie kennedy plays a slim shady moron who thinks he's black and calls himself B-rad which I think is so pathetic and even offensive to try and act black which he's really not. So I don't believe that B-rad is a true bad a** gangster rapper I think he's a huge moron who can't act his own age and race. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because of that one scene at the club where B-rad trys to do his own rap battle attack (which he really sucks at) against the real tough rappers who they all despised B-rad. That was the most funniest scene in this movie that cracked me up til I cried. 
 Fans of the Beyond might want to watch this for the "Frankenstein-like" man living in the basement of a creepy old house in the woods. A little kid ends up in the cellar with horrible results. Most of the film is spent researching the history of the house and owner via audio recordings, as a few guests, including the babysitter discover the nightmare waiting below, who happens to be looking for bodyparts to add to his own body.  Some classic Fulci gore here and there amongst the very slow, drawn out story, and a great worm gut scene at the end.  Worth a look for gorehounds who don't mind a whiny kid. Fulci's "The Beyond" ranks way 'beyond' this however 
 The baby bjorn is a nice carrier. I received one for my baby shower. However, I hardly used it. I thought I would use it a lot but I found I hardly used it after the first 3 months cause my baby weighed too much. Before that, the many straps made me afraid I was going to drop the baby. But probably the same problem for other carriers. I was really surprised by how little I used it, since I really wanted to carry my bab

 Reading this book , one might conclude that only five things mattered to Paul Hornung: football, alcohol, women (perhaps sex with women is more accurate), gambling and nightclubs (and the entertainers and hoods who inhabited them).  As a window into the personality of a rather shallow and non-reflective human being, this book might be worthwhile.  On any other level, it is a failure.  It offers little insight into the game of football, it's evolution over the 50's and 60's, or the people who played it for Notre Dame or the Green Bay Packers.  (Instant Reply or Distant Replay are both far superior).  What kind of school was Notre Dame?  I can't remember any class even being mentioned?  Did Hornung appreciate the unique environment of professional football in a small town like Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Again, not a word.  	The book reads like a quickie done for pocket change.  Some of the factual errors are quite remarkable: Hornung states that Fred Williamson played for the Raiders and got "hammered" in Super Bowl II.  Wrong: he played for the Chiefs in Super Bowl I.  He states that Frank Gifford was on the original broadcast team for Monday Night Football.  Wrong: Gifford joined in the second season, replacing Keith Jackson.  One wonders if Hornung actually read the ghostwriter's script. 
 The first 3 minutes is all you that you need to see. It shows a spy being chased into a Rammstein concert where it shows them playing the song Feur Frei! After that the movie just sucks, it has a bad plot and bad acting 
 I first got to know Cheryl Wheeler from her funny songs on the Sylvia Hotel CD. I also saw her in concert where I was taken with her folksy loving insightful songs. I also thought she was very bright and had an unbelievable way with words. But still the songs that got me most were the ones that were kind of funny. I have to say in a collection album with 19 songs, they are all very somber, and not the funny ones I was looking for. Her voice is beautiful, and the lyrics are still compelling, but don't plan to laugh 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 The disc never played.  I was sent a replacement and that didn't play either 
 I didn't received the model which I ordered. My order has been replaced twice, but it still didn't send the corrected one to me.   Thank you

I swear your review is the most funniest I have ever read here on Amazon and when I finished reading it I was giggling with laughter!...If you think Limp Bizkit is the greatest heavy metal band, then why are they not around anymore?! Limp Bizkit doesn't even come close to being a heavy metal band...By the way how the hell can you even say Metallica, Slayer, or Pantera are a nu metal band when they are NOT?! They don't even come close to being nu metal you stupid dumbass. Nu metal would be bands like Korn or Linkin Park or that band called Limp Bizkit. What I don't get is how you think Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix are posers when they were doing solos long before Limp Bizkit even existed. Fred Durst doesn't even come close to being a genius because either he or someone had come up with the most dumbest cd title I have ever read..and it's people like you that makes me really laugh because smart people know when to stay the hell away from MTV because they don't know what a real rock band is or a metal band for that matter... That's why they suck b*lls*       
 I purchased this book after it was recommended to a friend of mine. While reading it I felt as if I had found the cure for my PMS and heavy/painful periods.  I ran out and got some Natural Progesterone Cream that was recommended in the book, and started using it. Well all I can say is to proceed with caution. After using it for just a short time, I began to have a re-occurance of my depression symptoms.  I have since stopped using the cream and am slowly returning to my normal self.  When I did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone I found many people with my same experience.  This book is very one sided, and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream. Please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own, or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them.  This book has helped many people, I guess. But I'm not one of them 
 I actually laughed out loud at this book, and it's not supposed to be funny. As someone who is very interested in names and onomastics in general, I can honestly say I have no idea how this book was ever published.  The meanings are atrocious and can't be anything further from reality.  I saw the name "Choicey" meaning: One who chooses" listed in this book. Excuse me? Choicey isn't a name.  It dosan't exist, nor should it.  If you could give a toss less that your child's name is just an adverb, or a juxtoposition of letters from someone's last failed scrabble attempt, then by all means this is the book for you.  For those of you who want something meaningful, with some history... Who don't think naming your child "Spidey" is a good idea...then only buy this if you want to make fun of it.  THEN it can be worth something. I wish I could give it zero stars 
  "Nothing's okay," Westgate Penitentiary inmate Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) says, "I gotta get out."  That's because the sadistic screws are keeping the otherwise tractable inmates down with BRUTE FORCE.  You treat a man like an animal and he turns into one, right?   At least so sayeth the usually reliable director Jules Dassin in this overripe movie about a prison on the edge of explosion.  You see, the bad guys - the inmates - have a backstory, told in a series of flashbacks, that proves they're good guys under the prison grays.  They just got hooked up with bad women who made them do bad things.  Flashbacks don't lie.  They don't necessarily entertain, or keep a movie chugging onward at a comfortable clip, but they don't lie.  The prison officials, on the other hand... the otherwise decent warden is weak and vacillating.  The avuncular doctor drowns his reprehension in brandy, emerging from his alcoholic stupor  periodically to crack wry about the inhumanity of it all.   The baddest good guy is Capt. Munsey (`Sir' to you), Hume Cronyn, an effete sociopath with a blood taste for dishing it out (he seems particularly fond of whips) and a penchant for the insinuating seduction.     I wanted to like it, but as BRUTE FORCE plodded forward, piling melodramatic excess on melodramatic excess, I found myself fighting it.  Fighting the notion that everyone in effective authority was a heartless goon, the ineffective ones were broken (presumably by the ruthless System), and the inmates were misunderstood choirboys.  Despite its good looks, good performances and exciting final scene I had too many "Aw, c'mon" moments to honestly say I liked this movie.     The transfer print is in good condition, and the disk includes a hands-free Stills Pressbook Gallery with a number of behind-the-scene photographs, publicity stills, lobby cards and posters. 
 Scarface is without doubt one of the greatest emcees ever (no-one could write sicker rhymes than him), but this album is just terrible. The production is pretty dull on most cuts, and there are way too many guests.   "Sleepin In My Nikes" (with the late Seagram) is pretty nice  though. A cut that could've been good is "Homies And Thuggs"  (with a raw verse from the late Tupac Shakur), but it's ruined by Master  P's UUUUUUUUUUUGGGGHHH's. Don't waste your money on this. Scarface's three  other albums are much better 
 Please, read the Publisher's Weekly review for this book.  It's dead on.  Maybe because I'm now older, my tastes more refined, or maybe ghostwriting just doesn't do it, but I was laughing out loud at all the wrong parts.  I wanted the good guys to die, they all made me crazy.  Would you want have live a main character who has endless interior dialog with italics?  Terrible.  Awful.  Imagine all these words all in italics, and you get a glimpse of the writing as well! Kept telling my wife, "I'm going to finish this thing, if only to write a review of my own."  Well, here it is: do not buy this book at any price 
 Don't buy this book ..... unless you know exactly what you are looking for. This is a very expensive book for learning how to operate MS Project within the limitations I discovered only after buying the book.   If you manage projects in the real world you have probably struggled with balancing resources AMONG projects. Nothing could be more fundamental than this - or so I thought. But in 774 pages, this critical topic is not covered. Further, this limitation is not described in any of the reviews or in the Amazon Editorial Review.  When the book arrived, I found the following disclaimer to my dismay (and amazement) on page 10. I paraphrase:   "What You Won't find in this book..."  "....A discussion of how to manage multiple projects..."  "...Managing many small projects,..." "...managing one large integrated program schedule..." "...managing a porfolio of projects."  Well now having read the author's disclaimer up-front, if you still think the book is for you, then go ahead and read the other reviewers who have a lot more to say about the contents.    
 Fans of the ABC-TV show "LOST" will probably be buying "Our Mutual Friend" in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the "last book [I] ever [read]".  Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.  What a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, 'padded'.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages.   Dickens' work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop', "I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing."  'OMF' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence.   Even worse is the ending.  Some endings just can't help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.  All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for "The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens' oeuvre or are required to read "Our Mutual Friend", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens' far superior works:  'David Copperfield', 'Oliver Twist', 'Pickwick Papers'.    If you are looking for 'LOST' reading material, I would refer you to 'Watership Down' (Excellent), 'The Stand' (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), 'The Dark Tower' series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to 'Our Mutual Friend' possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke, Rousseau and Hume'.

 I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.  The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.  To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!  De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.  It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.  I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already 
 Books have been written, and will continue to be written, to try and disprove Christianity and Jesus as the Son of God. What is almost comical is that one has to print lies and errors to try and convince people. That's because you can't disprove the TRUTH. And what are some of the errors, you ask? I will give you a few: Dan Brown tries to use Gnostic gospels (gospels written in the 2nd century and beyond by people who were not eyewitnesses) to try and prove his theory and omitting New Testament Scripture. To say that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married by using the Gospel of Phillip (written after 250 A.D.) where there are missing words: And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [...] more than [...] the disciples, [...] kiss her [...] on her [...]. Clearly, there is some problems with this text with the missing words and the fact that it was written over 200 years after Jesus died. This does not prove anything. Also, he says that the word "companion" means spouse in Aramaic, which is great, except that the Gospel of Philip was written in "Coptic," where "companion" does not mean "spouse!" Second, Dan Brown says that it wasn't until 325 AD at the Council of Nicea did people start to believe Jesus was a Deity and that it was a close vote. New Testament disproves that because it shows that Jesus was Deity where Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5: "For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve." Also, The Council of Nicea met only to sort out some differences among church leaders, all of whom believed that Jesus was divine. The main question was whether Jesus was begotten or made. Jesus' divinity, death and resurrection were not in question. Only two of 318 clerics at the Council did not sign the Nicene Creed. So there was not a close vote unless you think 318 to 2 is close! Third, his main argument is that it Mary Magdalene in the Last Supper painting by Leo. If that were true, then where is John, the youngest and most beloved apostle? John was often portrayed in a feminine manner to convey youth, as is seen in many stained glass portraits in European cathedrals. And also, Leo was just a painter who was not around when Jesus was, so it didn't matter if he tried to put Mary in a painting or not! Fourth, Brown says that The Gnostic gospels and the Dead Sea Scrolls are "the earliest Christian records." While the New Testament obviously came before the Gnostic gospels, The Dead Sea Scrolls refer to a collection of about 900 documents, many of which are fragmentary scrolls written in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic, that were discovered in a cave and do not contain even a single mention of Jesus or of any other person mentioned in the New Testament as they are Jewish documents! He also says they were discovered in the 1950's when they were discovered in 1947. Oops! Fifth, Dan Brown says that Christianity borrowed its beliefs from the pagan religion of Mithraism. He says that Mithraism worshipped the pre-Christian God Mithras, called the Son of God and Light of the World, who was born on December 25th, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. Scholars of Mithraism would strongly disagree with Brown on all of these points. Nowhere is Mithras given the title Son of God and the Light of the World. Brown apparently made this up because it sounded good. Mithras was born on December 25th, however this proves nothing. The New Testament never associated December 25th with the birth of Christ. The early Christians chose to celebrate the birth of Christ on this day intentionally to oppose the pagan mid-winter festival of Saturnalia. They never claimed Jesus was actually born on that date. The claim that Mithras died and was buried in a rock tomb is just not true. Scholars will tell you that in Mithraism there is no death of Mithras at all. So, there was no rock tomb and no resurrection. So once again, he is nowhere near correct. Lastly, Brown says that the four canonical gospels were chosen from over 80 gospels. First, there were only less than half that many books written about Jesus life. The two Gnostic gospels Brown relies on most heavily weren't written until the second century A.D., long after the New Testament gospels were written. It makes sense that the Gnostic gospels came about in the late second century, as this is when Gnostic thought was most prevalent. However, the New Testament was complete before the end of the 1st Century. Also, the Gospel of Thomas, which Dan Brown lies heavily on,claims women must become men in order to receive salvation. That makes no sense. There are many other errors in this novel, but I think I have showed there are enough lies in this book not to be taken seriously. This is pure (or rather "poor") fiction, without a shred of evidence that Jesus was anything other than the Christ, the Son of the living God! Thank you, Dan Brown, for making my faith stronger 
 I love Steve Reich's music, but now he's old and doesn't have much to say, but has to keep cranking it out.  It's not very good at all!  Hang it up Steve...you've done more than enough!  (Does it get any funkier than Four Organs? 
 This product is not worth the money.  It does not keep the car cool and was a waste of my money.  Beware of products that only make money for the inventor 
 Richard Florida divides people into two groups, those in the creative class such as artists, musicians, and engineers and those not in the creative class, mainly people not engaged in so called "creative work". Based on his research into the characteristics of these groups he concludes that India and China are not the real threat in terms of high tech competition and it is the smaller European nations with more open political climates that are the real threat.  Obviously, Florida is not an engineer or a real scientist since anyone in the high tech field knows that India and China are the main competition for high tech jobs and the massive offshoring of engineering jobs is even lowering the number of students in college pursuing these fields.  The main problem is that Florida doesn't realize that an engineer with a 4 year university degree is not the same as a writer, musician or artist that may have no education at all especially in difficult math and science courses.  He mistakenly believes these two separate groups to be equal and the same in terms of contributing to high tech innovation and development.  For writers an open political climate is necessary to make a living writing controversial books.  However, for an engineer an open political climate is not essential in most cases but a stable  modern environment where he feels confortable living and working is needed.  Furthermore, Florida makes a huge deal about the "Gay Index" where high concentration of gays indicate a high concentration of the creative class and high tech innovation.    This may be true in western civilization but in China and India it is irrelavant.  Florida also seems to have given up on his "Technology" element of economic development for America because in his latest article for USA Today he states something to the effect that high tech innovation can be outsourced anywhere and America can only maintain its lead if it concentrated on "culture", "art", "music" and "improving retail service" jobs.       In conclusion, Richard Florida's creative class theory where "Talent", "Technology", and "Tolerance" is needed for economic development is fundamentally flawed.  Florida's writings lack the rigor and unbiased analysis of a real engineer or scientist but is designed to sell books to a socially liberal audience.    
 I bought this book for my 21 month old as she loves so many of the Dr. Suess books.  We didn't even get through the first couple of pages before she was bored with the story and illustrations.  Maybe she'll like it better in a few years, but for now it is just sitting on the shelf.. 
 The book looked fairly instreasting so I bought it a local store a fairly siginfigiantly higher price then amazon offers it. I noticed the binding looked bad on all of the copies, but choose the best copy and went home. The dvd was scatched, sticky and looked like it had been to hell and back.This is horribile, this publsiher needs to try to copy other reccent coffee table books such as according to the rolling stone's which is an handosome and well done book. I will be returning my copy to the store and hoping I can get  my money back or atleast an in store credit. This is the worst book of this type I have ever seen 
 No reviews for this video as the disk I have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of No Disk is displayed. As the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a DVD is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the DVD as i have to ship in from India. So I can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk.                                 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 I purchased Dr. Street's book out of curiousity of what the author would write to defend the evangelical method of altar calls and the ever so popular sinner's prayer.  Sadly, the book lacks any serious theological treatment of salvation and completely ignores the sovereignty of God in salvation.  The book seeks to be a guide both to evangelists and pastors to how to deliever an "effective" invitation (emphasis on numbers being the key word for effective.)  Dr. Street should have rightly named this book, "The Effective Manipulation Methods" and then traced the poor theology of Charles Finney right down to Billy Graham.  While Dr. Street does try to answer his critics (such as Martin Llyod-Jones) he never truly gives any answers but simply lists Llyod-Jones' nine reasons not to give an altar call and never gives any biblical reason we should do so.  Dr. Street works from a Baptist theology that ignores election and the work of the Holy Spirit (John 6:44; Acts 14:48) and places the emphasis on man (both pastors and hearers).  He cites not one biblical example of an actual altar call or genuine invitation but uses various Scriptures out of context to try to make his point.  He also gives justification to the sinner's prayer method although he never deals with any Scriptures concerning this matter (since there are none I would expect him to do so).    Overall, unless you are an Arminian in your evangelistic approach, then I would not encourage you to purchase this book.  It offers nothing in the means of theological content.  You would be better to read Iain Murray's book THE INVITATION SYSTEM or John MacArthur's ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS, or HARD TO BELIEVE.  
 This book was the most difficulty, unfriendly read for me.  It's full of tables and scientific stuff that I couldn't read or refer to easily.  I ended up giving it away which is a shame, but what's the point of collecting so much information if it's so unappealing to read and ultimately unreadable?  They really need to work on improving this, then again, it's an almanac - perhaps the expectations for a pleasurable read should be dim. 
 I've been a fan for years, and I thought (for some reason) that this would be the Bette of old that would add her fun quirky personality to some old classics.  However, The Divine Miss M went with a more sophisticated approach.  If you like that Bette then go for it, however, if you like the fun original Bette, opt out 
 Why is the title "A Do Right Man"?  I didn't get it.  What was so do right about Bobby Dallas?  He was the typical black man IMO.  He ended up with a great job and salary and only THEN did he decide that HE was ready to settle down and Faye was supposed to be with it.  NOT!    He played a couple of different women, was dishonest, and less than "right".   I only finished the book because I spent my hard owned money on it.  This book was ENTIRELY too slow.  It's like, please get to the point Omar Tyree.  After this, I believe I am finished supporting him and his less than stellar novels.  I only wish that I hadn't spent money on a black man writing about how hard it is for another black man out there in the dating and professional world when I can get that same sob story at any local hangout.  SAVE IT and SAVE YOUR MONEY!  
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 I am not often motivated to rate books, but this one annoyed me.  It is dull, repetitive, disorganized and discouraging.  As another reviewer noted, I guess I just didn't get the joke.  Don't buy it unless you want to be bored and depressed 
 I tried to read this book, but could not finish it.  The book had an interesting message, but it was lost in the inaccuracies, broad sweeping statements, and linear logic.    His comments about Peak Oil were inaccurate.  There are plenty of books (1,000 Barrels a Second, for example) that address the issues accurately with much more thoughtful insight.      With regard to broad sweeping statements he makes comments like the southeast is prone to individuality and violence.  He failed to mention that when it comes to a sense of community and willingness to help their fellow man there is no better place to live then the southeast.  (For the record I am originally from the upper Midwest, but lived in the southeast for 7 years.)  Much of his prognostications about the future are linear, that is if a then b then c.  The author is in his late 50s and I would think by this time he would have figured out that life is a dynamic process that constantly adjusts to its environment.  If the cost of energy is too high people buy better gas mileage cars, drive less, close off portions of the house in the winter, don't use the air conditioner, purchase smaller homes, etc.  If the environment changes people constantly adjust including me, the author, and you.  What bothers me most about the book is that young people with less "life-experience" will read this book and believe this is the way it is going to be.  The author's book is just one more scenario of what could happen in the future.  But if life is a dynamic process, the constant adjustments to the environment makes it really hard to predict what will occur 
 While it is true that this book reads like a novel, it is also true that it reads like one of the most poorly written novels I have ever forced myself to read. I say "forced myself" because the facts it contains on the Ingalls family are very interesting for someone who grew up on the books and television series. If you want to know about their real lives, this book provides that knowledge, in a round about way. If you can get past the cheesy 70's cover (complete with Laura in a low cut shirt gazing over her shoulder at a strapping, dimpled-chin version of Almanzo on the back), survive the writer's eternal conflict over whether he's writing a Harlequin romance novel or a pioneer biography, and wade through the repetitive use of the same gooey, sentimental phrases (I thought at one point that if he likened the rolling of the wagon to a lullaby one more time I was going to have to throw the book across the room), then this is the biography for you. The only good thing I can say without reservation is that it has great pictures. They are the only reason I didn't toss it when I was finally done 
 I'm a Van Damme fan but this movie sucks real bad, only good parts are the fight scenes at the end of the movie, perhaps the last 10 or 15 minutes. Buy it only if you can get it for like 7 bucks 
 I probably would have never read this book had I not received it as a gift.  However I am a fan of the occult and unexplained phenomenon, so I gave it a shot.  The book is entertaining; if only for the fact that her assertions about things like crop circles, the pyramids, and Atlantis are outlandish and fanciful.  Her research is morbidly flawed, she sites several websites, and never bothers to site any credible references.  It's important to note that the book has no bibliography.  Many of her conclusions are a result of information received from her spirit guide Francine, and it occurred to me many times while reading this book that perhaps Sylvia should take what Francine has to say with a grain of salt.    The book is rather light on content.  She tackles several "secrets & mysteries", however only dedicates a few pages to each.  Her chapter on alien abductions is barely three pages long.  For someone really looking to delve into unexplained phenomenon, there are plenty of books out there which explore these things in much greater detail and with more credibility.  But if the book happens to fall into your hands, you might as well read it.  It's good for some chuckles.  (Of course, it's not supposed to be funny. 
 It takes a REALLY good DJ like John Digweed to make Trance listenable. From what I've heard about Max Graham, I'd have thought he could do better than this. Two CDs of pure boring trance drivel. The tracklist grabbed me because he rounds out disc 2 with Underworld's unbelievable "Kittens." However, it embarrassingly crushes the tracks on either side of it (and everything else in the set). You'd be better off just getting UW's Beaucoup Fish, which contains the exact same version of "Kittens" in all its glory, without crappy tracks blended into it. If you are looking for superb progressive trance, go get Digweed's Global Underground Los Angeles. Both discs are the BOMB. Seriously 
 While I found the actual workout easy to follow and challenging, the diet advice brought me to an unhealthful physical and mental state. The guide suggests 15-20 grams of fat each day, while the FDA recommends 65 grams. For many smaller teens, 15-20 might be ideal. For others, it is a starvation diet. When I followed her advice (I am 15), I started daydreaming about food constantly, my metabolic rate slowed, and I eventually fainted due to malnourishment.     She also does not differentiate between so-called good and bad fats. Avocados and nuts contain good fats (polyunsaturated, monounsaturated,and Omega 3), yet she lists them as unhealthful, lumped into a category with foods that contain saturated and trans (bad) fats. Her autobiographical sketch discloses the source of her nutritional ignorance. She has a PHD, but in what? Probably English, because she claims she was once an English Teacher, and she does not list any actual credentials in the fields of Exercise and Health.   This book presents a significant danger and should be taken off the shelves 
 I did not like that way that the book talked to me as if I were a patient instead of a concerned parent.  Reading it, I felt like I was getting therapy instead of the advice I was looking for and need.  A lot more  factual information and specific direction, instead of so much "feel  good" stuff would have been helpful 
 This is the 2nd Law-of-Attraction type of book that I've read.  I bought it at the same time I bought Joe Vitale's "The Attractor Factor." After time, I have concluded that Losier's is the better book.  I've read other books since then too, and would like to upgrade my rating to three stars, but cannot change the star rating....  As I state in the title, I can't say with confidence that this whole metaphysical angle works.  I haven't had any significant successes with it.   I can comment on Mr. Losier's presentation of the material, though: It is, in a word, bloodless.  The information isn't bad, mind you--and if there is anything to the Law of Attraction stuff, his method may well work fine. But part of the trick to making this stuff work for you is believing it will, changing the way you *feel* about your relationship to the world and to what you want from it.  This book does very little to offer inspiration.  The prose is lifeless (with some really embarrassing writing errors that an editor should have caught).   A smattering of anecdotes revealing success stories would have added some flavor.   The anecdotes don't prove anything, of course.  But they can serve as an inspirations.  The worksheets that you can download to accompany this book are hardly worth the effort.  There is nothing there that is any better than writing on a piece of notebook paper, or typing out on the computer.  This book isn't bad.  The instructions are clear and straightforward, and you could do worse than begin with Losier's book if you are investigating this discipline 
 Warning: this book is only a rumination on the J2EE web services specification, fat on "theory" and with absolutely no real code examples you can run and play with to learn. Unless you are someone who can learn playing tennis looking at people playing it, or become a musician by listening to music, I doubt you can become a web services developer by just reading words and code snippets. As the author says: "this book doesn't attempt to cover installation, configuration, or deployment except in terms of standard J2EE requirements". I do believe that a decent tech book must have running code to support its explanations and support its value and usefulness. With this text Monson-Haefel is well on his way to win the "Most useless java book of the year" award 
 It's one of those "how to . . . in 10 or less steps" business book  It is useless information that anyone with common sense can figure it out. Says things like:  "Achieving a specific level or profitability will require producing and selling specific quantities of products or services to a specific market in a specific way" (page 24)Come on! tell me something usefull  Don't buy it. 
 Having used the book in the course taught by Merino, I have noticed that the examples given at the end of each chapter are erroneous in nature.  Many a time, I have found that the book lacks the basic elements of engineering economics.  This book is definitely not for undergraduates 
 this movie is so bad that i simply couldn't finish it. why this movie would be remade to renew the old 'prizzi's honor' is beyond my wits. this movie was just dumb and childish. totally ridiculous and shallow 
 I bought this book, thinking that it would offer some insight into Amazon.com in terms of what it was like to work there during its halcyon days.  Touted as a funny memoir, among other things, I was to discover that it was none of what was promised. In fact, the book was painfully difficult to read, as it was very poorly written, decidedly not funny, and offered little insight into what it really was like to work at Amazon. It was totally sophomoric in terms of what it did say.   The author should be thankful that he was not fired by Amazon, as that is what he richly deserved to have happen based upon his own account of what he was like as an employee. He was a total  slacker who treated customers with the contempt that he felt that they deserved. He was totally wasteful of the company's resources. He proudly stole supplies in bulk from the company. When toys were given to him for review purposes, he not only did not bother to review them, he then refused to return the toys to Amazon. He may think that all this is hilarious. Unfortunately, I do not. Reading this drivel felt like it took twenty-one dog years.   Moreover, this book was so poorly written, I am surprised that a reputable publisher went ahead with the expense of actually publishing it. Don't waste your time with this drivel. If you want to read a well-written, interesting book about working at Amazon, read "Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot. Com Juggernaut" by James Marcus 
 Fugazi is so bad it hurts, I've never liked them because they can't sing and their music is just plain boring. These guys are so old its funny, whoever takes this band seriously is an idiot. 
 How dissapointing to read this book.  Unfortunately, it starts off weak and dies after a couple of pages. I'm sorry, but I'm serious!  When I got it, I was stunned!  Not only are the lines insipid and meaningless, the author puts the 200 of them one-per-page! For example, from "Rebel Without A Cause": "Mom, dad .. this is Judy.  She's my friend."  What the heck is that supposed to mean?  I couldn't even find a bio of the "author" in the book. ( Frankly, I really felt like I was ripped off! )  EXCEPT FOR ONE THING!   I only bought the book because I was researching to see if there was already one out there like the one I wanted to write?  This book sounded the closest at the time, so I shelled out the bucks.  But, while I was dissapointed, I was also elated!  It meant that the idea for my book;  REEL LIFE 101; 1,101 Classic Movie Lines That Teach Us About Life, Death, Love, Marriage, Anger and Humor, was timely.  Mine aren't meaningless quotes,  They're the movie lines that we don't remember ... but never forgot!  The ones that changed our lives!   So, if you're a "reel" movie lover like me,  I sincerely encourage you to check out my new ( first and only ) book now available here on Amazon.com.  Respectfully yours,    Jon Anthony Dos 
 This is one of the most horribly muddled "thrillers" I've ever read.  By the end, I wasn't sure who was "winning" or "losing," nor did I really care.  Clive better quit sub-contracting out his writing.  He should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on Dirk Pitt.  
 Swartzwelder is the best writer on the Simpsons staff, bar none. But his prose style leaves so much to be desired. What works within the context of a voiced animated show falls flat on its face in print.  Swartzwelder revisits the character of Frank Burly, P.I., last seen in "The Time Machine Did It". That earlier novel worked, even though the joke got a litle long-in-the-tooth at the end. Here, the attempt to once again meld film-noirish black-and-white movie cliches with 50s-ish science fiction, this time an alien invasion that only Burly is too stupid to realize is happening, cannot even elicit a guffaw.  Some may feel Burly is simply Homer recast as Phillip Marlowe. But even Homer would remember to be, you know...funny. In this case, the formula very quickly becomes. Burly almost discovers invasion, incident causes Burly great pain, Burly forgets there is an invasion. It just does not hold up.  Maybe those who read this book without reading its predeccesor will enjoy it more as they will be unfamiliar with the formula. For those who are attracted purely by the "writer of the Simpsons" blurb, you're better off buying any of the DVDs and passing on this.  
 Good story and fast read but too much graphic sex.  I like my imagination better than all of the graphic details 
 After publishing the best introduction to home brewing Papazian released this unenlightening tome.  His snappy style, so essential in his first book, sounds dull and contrived.  One third of the book is complete filler as he lists 60 pages of various beer styles along with their specific gravities, etc.  This information could have been presented in a two page spread.    Additionally, he offers little in the way of advanced brewing technique.  The one saving grace of this book is the recipe section, with interesting ideas like a lambic barley wine and a raspberry imperial stout.  If you are looking for a book that offers a firm overview of all-grain brewing then I can recommend 'Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide' or Noonan's 'Brewing Lager Beer.'  Papazian's  book will most likely be a complete disappointment 
 Any album that lists the "Iowa Fight Song" followed by (Iowa State) can't be any good.  It's the University of Iowa Fight Song, not Iowa State University.  And from the preview I heard, they didn't do it justice anyway 
 I admit it's cute and my child loves it.  But the grammar is terrible!  The author inexplicably switches from present tense to past tense and back again.  He uses passive voice for his Rhumba Dance punchline.  He makes contractions out of nouns and the verb "is" and there is even a typo -- a stray end quotation mark without an initial quotation mark.  Our children learn a lot about language from their books and I object to poor writing packaged with slick images 
 They are all identical.  He reminds me very much of TV evangelists.  No advice that is worth your money.  Go buy "We Shall Not Fail: The Inspiring Leadership of Winston Churchill" or "Speak Like Churchill, Stand Like Lincoln: 21 Powerful Secrets of History's Greatest Speakers".  I beg you 
 I watched it on big screens (57 and 106 inches) and whenever there is fast movement or the camera moves, the dancers are not sharp. I even wrote OpusArte about it, but was informed they don't see any problems with it.  The performance itself is outstanding, but the DVD is visually poorly produced 
 Not only did my kids seem very bored by this book, but I was a little disturbed that one of the very few suggestions of activity was a mother monkey "smacking" her baby 
 Despite the some edition problems and the presence of lagoons in the script, the story retains its interest. A disturbed woman in his early twenties, who has suffered sexual abuse of his own father and maltreats of his husband finds casually, a man in the middle of the road who eventually will help to dig in her life and face her demons.          
 I excel at logic games.  I had hoped to learn something useful with this book.  It advertises itself to be a step-by-step guide.  However, about half way through the book, on page 33, it says, "Since you're now more familiar with the ideas, we'll give less explanation in what follows."  Then it proceeds to just give statements telling you that certain numbers belong in certain boxes of the exemplar puzzle, without telling you how the author arrived at that conclusion.    I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It leaves a lot to be desired 
 There is nothing wrong with the form of this documentary: It is well presented with great CGIs, narration and overall structure - hence it is worth at least two stars (whatever this stars rating business means).  The problem is the substance: it is simply not there. Menzies is one of those pseudo-scientists (as he is indirectly described by one of his opponents) that are in love with their own baseless theory and are not prepared to question its validity regardless of the absence of evidence corroborating it or the presence of evidence contradicting it.  I think a true scientist should not be emotionally attached to any theory and should simply be involved with the process of discovering evidence. Menzies, starts off with his conclusion (rather than ending with it) and fumbles his way backwards trying to find evidence to support it. When all alleged evidence is demolished, he arrogantly states that he will not budge, "one millimetre" as he puts it, from his theory and that, in time, everyone will accept it as a fact that the Chinese were the first to discover America.  A true scientist, even in the presence of evidence substantiating his/her viewpoint, always keeps an open mind and is prepared to accept the eventuality that they may be proved wrong in the future. Menzies does exactly the opposite: with no evidence on his side, he refuses to admit even for a second that he just may be wrong.  It saddens me that by simply engaging in what is nothing short of unsubstantiated verbal diarrhoea, Menzies - not a scientist but, at best, a qualified mariner - managed to make a buck on his book and that PBS, helped him earn some more on the back of his childish theory by making a documentary on him. The feeling one gets at the end, is that PBS ran out of ideas for their next production and decided to make a meal out of this chap's air-ology.  Whilst visually pleasing, this PBS production is in substance a waste of time to watch, as it is neither educating nor troubling the mind of the viewer 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 Have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it. Simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme.  They say we Americans are obese in body, but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism.  Page after page of glossy ads for things we do NOT need.  And rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections.  Sure they make pretty pictures, but who wants all that 'junk' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful.  I recommend the magazine Dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning.  For someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden, Oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply. And how many homes does one American need, when so many Americans cannot afford even one 
 So what else is new?  I feel sorry for Gary Allen.  He wrote a whole little book about this vast conspiracy of rich people, back in 1971.  The Council on Foreign Relations was the main gathering place for these nefarious people.  What Mr. Allen seemed to miss is that rich people have always had the power to run the world, and probably always will.  The culprit in this scenario is not rich people per se, but the system itself.  Mr. Allen seems to be a supporter of capitalism, free enterprise, and what it has produced in the world.  Well, guess what?  If there was a conspiracy then, it's probably still going on now, but who cares, really?  You going to bang your head against the wall ranting against the rich?  I'm not: I'm going to give in, if that's what they want.  You know what else?  So did Christ.  He gave in to the "powers that be" and that was his example to us.  His kingdom is not of this world.  That's why I feel sorry for Mr. Allen.  He's so wrapped up in this world he can't see the forest for the trees.  That's why his book is seldom read anymore, if it ever was.  Another mistake he makes: Rich people do die, just like the rest of us.  You don't think that at least some of them finally decide to stop conspiring against the world?  I do.  They may be rich, but a small fraction still has a conscience, maybe more, who knows?  I don't know any rich people myself.  I'm not living in poverty, so I guess I've been "bought off" by the conspirators.    Aside from all that, it does have some interesting points, about the Federal Reserve and about the Council on Foreign Relations, both of which still proceed as usual, never mind Allen's book.   Gary Allen touts the John Birch Society.  And if you vilify that group, well you're just giving in to the conspirators, aren't you?    If you like conspiracies, widespread ones, you'll get a kick out of this book.  I think it's destined for the junk pile of lost causes.  Diximus. 
 We bought this trash can, which seems to have a very sturdy design and appears to be well made about 3 months ago.  We noticed after only a short while that the "step-on lid opener" would not open the can as far as it had before.  After a couple of days the plastic peice on the bottom broke. This can was used mainly by my husband and myself and was not put through any rough handling.  I have yet to find a replacement part and I did not save my receipt or any purchase information...because it is a TRASHCAN that is supposed to be the best that money can buy.  The metal does not stain or pit, it is very solid albeit the opening mechanisim.  If I find replacement parts, I will write another review with that information 
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 Avoid this collection at all costs.  This is yet another among the plethora of public domain releases haphazardly thrown together without any regard for the quality of presentation. The source materials for these films, as you might imagine, are remarkably awful. But Passport International couldn't stop at being just any other over-night public domain distribution scam. What makes this collection cross over from "horrible" to "hilarious travesty" is that a red logo is at the bottom of every frame. I kid you not. The bottom of every hazy, warped, mutilated, vinegar-soaked frame 
 You would think by now I would have learned not to judge a book by its cover, but that's exactly what I did in this case. The picture on the front cover is charming. The words "Fresh, engaging, and authentically British" from a Booklist reviewer are splashed on the cover. And that reeled me in.  If you like the cozy mystery genre, and are a fan of Agatha Christie, Anne Perry, Dianne Day, Rita Mae Brown, or Margaret Miles, this may not be the book for you. If you liked the 90's TV show Roseanne, you're in for a treat. She's back, this time as a British house cleaner named Lois. Ann Purser goes out of her way to make Lois unsympathetic, and her husband Derek and daughter Josie downright annoying and unlikeable. It seems as though Purser's trying to break down the stereotype of the British mystery by choosing working-class characters in modern times, which I completely respect, but she's building up another stereotype at the same time: that working-class people are brash, crass, and argumentative.  Aside from unsympathetic and sometimes annoying characters, the conclusion of this mystery is a bit far-fetched, and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. The sad thing is, I'm not even all that curious about having them answered.  A very unsatifying read. 
 There are as many nights as days, and the one is just as long as the other in the year's course. Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word 'happy' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. -Carl Jung    The story of Bone written by Fae Myenne Ng is a dramatic story that takes place in Chinatown of San Francisco. It is based on the lives of a Chinese American family that has lost the life of a family member. The family is frowned upon because Mah the mother of Ona, Leia, and Nina had 3 daughters. To have a female child is to have bad luck, because they are useless, they show no bravery, they serve no purpose but to have children and they disrespect the families' name. The book touches upon all different aspects of Leia's life in no chronological order, she relives each story through incisive memoirs. You learn that Mah had an affair, with a man and he left her when he knew she was having a daughter. Then she met Leon; Leon worked in the shipping industry and Mah at the baby store. Mah and Leon fell quickly for each other. But when Leon was out at sea she was secretly in love with Tommie Hom. He had hired Mah for her looks, even though she could not sew at all. Tommie taught Mah how to sew beautiful dresses almost as fast as the patterns were printed. She became the best sewing lady Tommie had ever had.  As a kid Ona loved to wait for Leon's ship to come in, she cried for days after he left for sea. She was the type of kid that became emotionally wrapped around anyone she met. Ona loved to be around people all the time, she spent her days at the butcher shop with the owner, and he taught her how to wrap the raw meat to be sold. She also liked to hang out in the laundry room with Leon. One day Tommie Hom decided to hire a women by the name of Rosa she was a lovely woman that Mah quickly become attached to when teaching her how to sew. They became such good friends that Rosa's husband Luc and Leon liked to be in each other's company. When one day they decided to close up the baby shop and open a Laundry Mat in their name. It was a good success but it did not last long. A few months after they opened and all the bills were just being paid off Leon and Mah went in to open up the shop and to their surprise they could not open the door, the lock had been changed. They called Luc but no one would answer. That's when they learned that they had been taken advantage of. Ona had fallen in love with Luc and Rosa's son Osvaldo. Leon was furious with her but the more he hated there relationship the more they fell for each other.  The story touches upon death, Ona whose troubled life ends tragically in early adulthood when she jumped to her death at the top of the Nam because she was prohibited from marrying the man she loved.  The book episodes all different aspects of Leia's life in no consecutive order, she relives each story through incisive memoirs. Through out much of the book you learn about Ona and how the family deals with the guilt. Everyone wonders why she jumped, they ask over and over how they could prevented this, but the family learns in time that your fate is determined by the choices you make. Leia makes her way from feeling guilty to parting the ways between sadness and being truly happy like a ship liner on the open sea. The sea is life and the liner is the awakening.  I believe to get the most out of this book you must look for a deeper meaning. The author is Chinese American and they are traditionally instilled with a form of emotional meanings. While reading this book I realized that I saw what the Leong family endured was incredibly sad and that is had a unfortunate effect on the family. I did not allow myself to become emotionally surrounded by what the Leong family was faced with. They encountered death, and pain, sadness and defeat but they still moved on to support each other and they moved on with life. They learned with every life there is death and with every affliction their will be gallantry.  Fae Myenne Ng describes each moment with descriptive language each sentence takes you to a sidewinding conclusion. In her memoirs you get a strong feeling of deep emotion, from guilt, to love, pain, and grief are completely described in a narrative perspective. The type of memoir used was very serious it gave the story line a very mysterious title. You can tell how Fae pictured Ona, she was like a blossom she was radiant and sweet, full of life and loved. When Ona was stopped from marrying the man she wanted dearly she could not subside from such a cold-hearted decision from the traditional Chinese family.  Birth and Death are the two noblest expressions of bravery. --Kahlil Gibra 
 I did not learn anything new that i have not read in cosmo (the magazine). Actually I would rather read cosmo then this book...  There are a few positions to try... nothing new. And a few suggestions on oral sex and other things such as turn ons. Overall, the book was ok, the pictures were a let down and i would not recommend this book to anyone. I was not that impressed with it 
 When I hear adjectives like absurd and surreal being used to describe an artistic work, I get all happy and excited.  Carroll's my favorite author and Magritte's my favorite painter, so there was no doubt in my mind that I would fall in love with The Trial after the first page or two.  That didn't happen.  No matter...maybe within the first few chapters I'd warm up to the book.  Still didn't happen.  About halfway through I realized I wasn't going to like The Trial at all, but continued to the end anyway so that I might post an informed review of the book right here on amazon.com.  Humor?  Forget about it.  Two laughs at the most.  Kafka appears to have been a depressed, depressed individual.  Now, if you're heavily into pathos and criminal justice, Kafka might be a great author for you, but if you're like me, and looking for the type of absurd that's funny, Carroll's the way to go.  The type of absurd in this book is limited to the dreary kind which lacks any kind of wondrous magic.  The protagonist appears to be so completely apathetic, that when he's killed by court order in the last chapter, a thought hits me - "Here lies a boring man."  I feel that his apathetic attitude didn't contribute much to the book.  Not a good trait to have in a main character.  Since this work was never finished, I don't feel too bad about making editorial comments.  In my opinion chapter 4 and the entire Fraulein Burstner character could be completely removed from the book without affecting anything.  I see nothing but padding as far as these items are concerned.  Perhaps they were meant to be developed more fully, but the author didn't live long enough to complete the task.  I also think chapters 2, 3, 8, and the first part of 7 are in need of severe abridgement.  It shouldn't take two whole pages to say, "This trial thing is getting in the way of the apathetic hero's bank career."  Chapter 9 is by far the best chapter, with an interesting parable about the doors one must enter to access the law.  If you read this chapter alone and skip everything else, you won't miss much.  You might miss a guy in a bullfighter costume in a fragmented chapter somewhere, but that's alright.  I think what Kafka was trying to do was make The Trial as real as possible and, at the same time, make it as weird as possible.  It was an interesting idea, but unfortunately the result turned out to be an Alice in Wonderland without the magic and humor.  Far more dull than I would have ever expected.  Kafka doesn't seem like a bad guy.  He seems nice, and I'm glad a lot of people like his work, but I'd be lying if I said, "Oh yeah, this book was awesome.  I highly recommend it."  It just didn't put a smile on my face, whereas many other books I've read in the past have done just that.  But perhaps I'm not the best person to consult for a review.  Honestly, if the hero were something silly like a giant rooster, I might have given this book five stars 
 I read this novel wanting to discover what others said they saw.  But all I saw was the author's desperate cry for attention.  I couldn't get past that.  I do see how fellow customer reviewers could cry through this book but that's not necessarily a good thing. But how could someone be moved?  Or find the words magic?  I don't get it. The work is flat and meaningless to me.  I only hope you see more in it than I 
 I use these alot, and got this to replace a GE timer that had fried.  Total junk.  The "manual override" function is just "Turn the dial until light is on or off as desired."  You must be freaking kidding me.  I got the 15 AMP rated timer, and it's only 2 prong...  WTF?  You don't run 15 AMPS without ground.  Dumb.  As other reviewers noted, it's loud, it often doesn't even work properly.  Save your money and just look for someone who has already bought one.  Chances are they've already determined it stinks and have it sitting in a drawer somewhere unused.  They'll give it to you happily 
 This is a terrible book with a terrible message: that you should use the understanding of other cultures in order to infiltrate and change them. That is NOT the message of anthropology.  As an anthropologist, I resent this book profoundly.  Anthropology is based on tolerance for other cultures, interest in their own ways of being and believing, and the concept of cultural relativism--that a culture's values and morals can only be understood in their own terms.  The one thing we do NOT do is try to impose our own "truths" on others.  If missionaries want to learn what anthropology really is, then read an anthropology book.  But this text merely steals from anthropology in the most primitive way and turns that stolen material into the guidelines for cultural judgment, invasion, and destruction. It is arrogant and misguided 
 Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
 I am really wondering about the people who have reviewed this and gave it such good ratings.Ive been looking at their other reviews trying to understand what it is they like. Because this movie STINKS!  Im a huge Reese Witherspoon fan and I like Paul Rudd so I rented this movie and thought it would be good. Oh boy I was wrong. The charachters are over the top and the story is just cheesy. Im all for a good fun, romantic comedy. I like "Win a date with Tad Hamilton" but this is just awful.   Reese plays a stripper (somehow it just doesnt work)who helps the dorky hopeless Rudd dump then win back his girlfriend. All the time there is a package to stop hence the name "Overnight Delivery".   The story could have worked but it just doesnt. The premise is good and there are parts that are somewhat ammusing but overall it sucks.  I would reccomend this movie to anyone who liked the Sarah Michelle Gellar movie "Simply Irresistable". If you happened to like that movie with the magical little crab. If you disliked it as I did then stay away. 
 After my 2nd month on line, which included 1 month "underground," I one day woke up with an epiphany. As I changed the bandages on my ribs, I realized how absolutely stupid I'd have to be to ever want to turn to the people who inflicted that much violence on me and call them "Brother." I knew my history inside and out, I was loyal to a fault, and I still, in the name of "Brotherhood" had to endure whatever my line "brothers" endured at the hands of some pathetic individuals who called themselves "men." Fortunately for me, I dropped and never looked back. Today I'm a lawyer, husband, and father of two; never once having to wonder what "The Mysteries of Omega" would've offered me. What it GAVE me was a permanent sinus condition due to a broken nose, a bruised larynx from a punch to the throat, and the aforementioned cracked ribs.  The emphasis on academia? What a delightfully humorous and boldfaced lie. I know for a fact that 11 of my 14 line "brothers" had their transcripts doctored by an employee in the registrar's office; who also happened to be the wife of the frat's president. I'm confident ... make that positive ... that a simple comparison of that line's transcripts that were submitted to the National Chapter to the transcripts at the college would prove it.

 The music on this CD was not nearly as good as I had hoped for...Too much similarity from song to song.. 
 If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it.   Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.  Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others.   That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.       
 What, another stupid sequel to a crappy horror mess? I did not know that studios were this desperate for some lousy cash. This franchise needs to be destroyed. Skip this and look at another product 
 TOO BORING TO GO ANY FURTHER THAN THE FIRST SEVERAL CHAPTERS. I THUMBED THROUGH THE REST AND SAW IT WAS ALL THE SAME. NOT REALLY A PERSONAL CONFESSIONAL-SHE MENTIONS HER PROCEDURES VERY BRIEFLY. IT INSTEAD READS LIKE TEXTBOOK MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE ORIGINS OF PLASTIC SURGERY. IF YOUR ANYONE WHO HAS HAD, OR IS PLANNING TO HAVE ANY SURGERY OR INJECTIONS, SKIP THIS BOOK-UNLESS YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT SOLDIERS WHO WERE DISFIGURED AND MAMED DURING WAR SO PLASTIC SURGERY WAS BORN. ALONG THOSE SAME LINES, I DID NOT WANT TO READ IN EXCRUTIATING DETAIL ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE "POISON" BOTOX AND HOW IT WAS ORIGINALLY FOUND AND DEVELOPED FROM ROTTEN SAUSAGES. THE STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE SHE ACTUALLY KNEW ARE SHORT AND SO COMPLETELY OFF THE WALL FROM WHAT ANY NORMAL WOMAN WOULD EVER WANT TO DO ARE USELESS TO READ ABOUT AS WELL. UNLESS YOU ARE RESEARCHING FOR REFRENCE THE STATISTICS AND ORIGIN OF PLASTIC SURGERY-SKIP THIS BOOK 
 Having heard so many good things about this book, I was curious to read it and hoped that it would yield some valuable insights about raising our transracial family.   Unfortunately, what I read was one man's bitter diatribe against his family and a conclusion that not only did his parents not love him well, but that he would never belong with them--a conclusion that both saddened and horrified me.   I wasn't expecting for his road to be easy, but I had hoped that he would offer some more constructive, hopeful thoughts. Instead he comes across as angry and resentful.  
 This book is unapologetically about triviality. It begins with the rise of popularity of the trivial, illusion and fakery, in America since the time of P.T. Barnum. It is about the creators and consumers of illusion who  replaced 'survivors' in after the transition to life in the megalopolis in  America. John Berger has pointed out that zoos, stuffed animals, pets and  eventually Disneyworld emerged as mankind became divorced from the fight to  survive against nature, where animals were essential. The book does not  explain why, in its appetite for illusion and triviality (consumerism,  consumption of the media) America is so advanced with respect to Europe  (the decline is there, if slower: the worst Hollywood films are extremely  popular among Europe's youth). Gamson informs us of Holmes' expectation  that photography would lead to the triumph of superficiality, and of  Boorstin's description of the celebrity as a person who is well-known for  his well-knownness. Political campaigns are accurately described as  pre-packaged media affairs, where the participants have become game-players  and the events themselves, like talk-shows, have become pseudo-events.  People immitating the media immitating people. The future is trivial  because trivial expectations determine the future via pre-packaged daily  behavior. Gamson does not explain why we have evolved to this state of  super-triviality, and why we seem to be stuck with it. This was more or  less explained poetically by Spengler, and also poetically in still fewer  words by John Berger, who informs us clearly and concisely on the subjects  of Gamson's discourse: "It would ... be possible to talk of the  'homelessness' of the bourgeois with his town house, his country home, his  three cars, his televisions, his tennis court, his wine cellar-it would be  just possible, yet nothing about his class interests me, for there is  nothing left to discover." Gamson's book is precisely about the  people, and their admirors, about whom there is nothing worth discovering 
 Very disturbing --on serveral counts.  i had high hopes for Stephan flash back for someone 2000 years old of his life,relationships with other women in his life and most of all understanding his feelings towards Beatrix. i had a hard time following the story line due to the sexual exotic scenes with him and the Daughters. i really did not understand the purpose of it all in holding himself in.  i love Stephan and my heart went out to him because there was so much guilt within himself, feeling bad about Asharti and mostly the fact that Beatrix left him.  i wanted to cried through it all because i guess the love i wanted for him he could not have and if if he express his love towards Beatrix his idealist ideas held him back 
 Paralysed Age is O.K but I've heard better. "Bloodsucker 2000" is my favorite track on this CD but it all sounds rather bland and seems to cater to the misfit "goth" teen scene. Save your money or better yet get The Vampire Lucan Wolf's CD "Vampire Nights" it's alot more fun and better produced 
 I had high hopes for this little gadget, being a fan of grilled sandwiches. Unfortunately, one experience was all it took to convince me that this grill isn't the way to go.  I tried to make two grilled ham and cheese sandwiches. Within about 30 seconds of the grilling, it was pouring cheese out all sides of the grill (and no, before you wonder I didn't use a lot of cheese). I didn't even let it finish the cooking cycle because the cheese was getting underneath the grill and I didn't want it near the cord.   When I opened the unit I got two sandwiches that needed to be separated from one another (and cut into halves) using a steak knife, and even that was a pain. The sandwiches themselves, which started as standard store-bought bread, were now mashed into what looked more like pita bread (hollow, thin, and a little tough). The edges were burned black; just generally not a good sandwich.  As opposed to cleaning the liquid cheese off, this device just went in the trash. I can't recommend this even over just a standard non-stick griddle 
 sensationalist, titiliating, and as a result, a total let-down (much like "heavier than heaven")  while Cross's journalistic eye provides some interesting detail re: Jimi's early years, after that, it reads like "Hammer of the Gods" meets the National Inquirier.  just plain silly, and a disservice to the greatest guitar player ever.  Cross spends more time examining Jimi's proclivity for groupies and drugs (which, of course, is part of the story...i guess), than the music itself.  It would have been nice to know, say:  In 1966, preceding acid rock and living in a relatively tame NYC, how did Hendrix come to write the songs that comprised "Are You Experienced"?  how did his playing transcend his predecessors?  how did dylan influence his songwriting?  (we learn Hendrix *did* emulate Dylan's hair.)  we don't know.  now, if Cross was unable to formulate  answers on his own, then could have easily dialed up a litany of rock critics, musicians, and fans who'd be happy to extrapolate.    instead we get only crumbs, which are ultimately overshadowed by second-hand stories from druggies ("jimi didn't like alcohol!", ex-groupies ("jimi wanted to marry me!", and hangers-on ("jimi slept with 8 chicks at once.")  it was thorougly exasperating.  if you came from Mars and read this, your impression would be that yes, Jimi was messed up and reckless; but you would have no idea he was one of the most influencial artists in the history of the world.  if the book meant to honor Hendrix, it did the opposite.    if you want incisive analysis of the *music* itself, simply read Amazon readers' reviews of his records.  The fans themselves -- not an overwrought author -- can encapsulate the power and beauty of Hendrix far better, and far more consisely. 
 I enjoyed this crazy story while it lasted but felt unsatisfied when it was all over. Just stange in the end, although I did enjoy the ride most of the time 
 Does not measure up to the Shihatsu 110 AC messager, which actually works. This unit has multiple vibrating buzzers. I could not feel the heat. The motors turned on high create an odd noise much like the kids' giant bass speakers 
 Having been born in the mid-'80's, I unfortunately did not yet exist to experience the late '70's punk movement or was too young to be part of the '80's hardcore years. Instead, I got to grow up with the MTV generation.... how so very lucky I am. Yet, I figured out the difference between real music and the junk mainstream media keeps referring to as "punk". So, if I could figure it out, any other idiot from this forsaken generation shouldn't have any problems. Good Charlotte is okay if you're 8 years old, but if you're 13 and you're still listening them you need to just grow up and listen to much better stuff. If you're my age and you listen to Good Charlotte then you are beyond any help.  Instead of Good Charlotte, buy or steal the real thing: Subhumans:Time Flies + Rats. It was the first one I picked up and it led to an entire collection of real, gritty, raw punk music. Bottom line: go from whining about how much your life sucks to actually doing something about it. 
 After listening to Bonamassa on "New Day Yesterday" I was captured by the raw power and abundance of guitar mastery. So - I went and bought the lot of Bonammassas CDs hoping to dig into more imaginative guitar power.  In "So, It's Like That" I found an abundance of sing-along la-la cliches. If you are a fan of Bruce Springsteen you will like the hoarse screaming and loose guitar chords. Allright, a few places the guitar shines but the melodi lines and the broad chrorus style singing drags it down into the pit of trivialities. Sorry!  A single track, "Pain and Sorrow" shines though but boy it was hard to get to track 9. Track 13, "The Hard Way", has a 4 minutes sing-along intro ... or whatever happened as a new track actually starts after 4 minutes and 17 SECONDS OF SILENCE lastning the remaining almost 4 minutes. Maybe it's art, what do I know! 
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 i never recieved the dvd i bought from you guys. im very dissapointed in amazon and the dealer i orderd this from. i have been waiting for months for this dvd that i already paid for. i had given up untill i got this e mail asking me for a review. so i want either my money back that i already paid ,or my product that i nevr recieved i am very dissapointed in both  please either send me a refund ..or the dvd that i already paid for!!! james young...xixorsone2000@yahoo.co 
 I was very disappointed with this book. I had already made the decision to breast feed before buying this book, so I was bored reading the lengthy text about why I should breastfeed.   Breastfeeding is tricky and frustrating in the beginning. You will have a lot of questions about what you can, can't eat, how often you need to breastfeed, what signs you should look for to determine if your baby has an allergy to food, and how to start weaning if you are going back to work. The book doesn't provide enough detail to answer these questions. Also the organization of the book didn't make sense to me and the index is not helpful.   I found the website kellymom.com much more helpful in terms of providing breastfeeding tips and answers to breastfeeding questions. 
 If you want to waste your money on a useless product, then buy shedender. The people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair (specifically undercoat). However, my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding. The rub is that the undercoat doesn't shed (not that much anyway) the top coat does. So all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that isn't the root of your shedding problem in the first place, and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside.  As I said, this product does remove a lot of hair. However, after a full session with the shedender, I went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as I usually do. The next day, I wired out just as much as I would have if I didn't use shedender. The bottom line, your pets shed from their top coat, not the bottom coat; so you're wasting your time and money with this product 
 It's tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how BAD it truly is, but Ms. Grafton has somehow earned a following, and as I've said before, there is something for everyone out there. After all, some people (not a majority) actually voted for George W. Bush, on purpose! I think this level of mystery fluff is for them.  Rather than spoil the nutty climax (I have worked in hospitals for years, so I ain't buying it) I will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words: "...life is one big, savage joke; not funny ha-ha, but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began."  I became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began (where did they go to kindergarten?) that I almost missed the rest of the chapter 
 Stevie, Stevie, Stevie!! Where has all the brilliance gone? There are exactly 3, count 'em, 3 good songs on this album and they simply aren't enough to salvage what amounts to a piece of pedestrian product and half-hearted attempts at sounding comtemporary. The opener, "You Will Know" with it's simple message of hope and lilting fairlight melody, "With Each Beat Of My Heart", his least syrupy ballad in years and the skeletal groove of "Skeletons" and it's indictment of liars, cheaters and cover-ups (Corporate America should really listen to this one nowadays) are the only worthwhile tracks here and it breaks my heart to listen to the rest of the garbage that makes up the remainder of this release. Filler is one thing, but this is ridiculous 
 There aren't enough words to express how miserable Christopher Paolini's novel is. There aren't enough synonyms for "bad" to more easily translate to you, visitors of Amazon, the awful writing, plotting, characterization, prose, thematic and stylistic concerns of this book. In fact, there aren't enough enough ways to show the overall immaturity of the book's fans who cannot stand to have their Bible marked as anything less than incredible and awe-inspiring literature.  I won't even try.   I urge you, turn somewhere else for a decent read. You won't find it here 
 Being a new Blu-ray owner I was anxious to acquire some high resolution material.  This was one of three discs in my first order and a quick lesson in shopping blind.  For full disclosure I will reveal that we only watched about the first half of the feature before hitting "eject".  At best, 10% of this program was high res, mostly familiar footage of ground based NASA training, etc.  All of the shuttle lift-off and orbital footage was standard res or worse, presented as a documentary and fully narrated.  Very disappointing and a waste of money.  The other two discs in the order were quite nice. 
 Maxwell's concepts of what a leader is is quite accurate.  However, I don't think he needed to spend over 200 pages to define what a leader is.  That's what this book came to be: one long, repetitive, obvious definition for leadership.  I didn't see these as laws so much as nuances of what he'd already said.  As a woman, reading this book was made more difficult with his overwhelming use of sports and male leaders.  The few examples he uses of female leaders are the few and the cliched (ex., Mother Teresa and Princess Diana).  A nun and a princess.  How many women in business are either of those?  Where are the examples strong, successful, inspiring female business and sports leaders?  I also found his use of his religious roles and examples tiresome.  What I felt that this book lacked most was more suggestions to improve one's leadership skills?  He suggests training, but not what kind nor does he provide exercises for developing oneself as a leader.  Another failure of this book is how he rarely addresses how a strong leader should deal with situations that aren't going well.  A great leader's abilities are best exemplified and most apparent in times of conflict.  I also strongly disagree that a positional leader isn't necessarily a true leader.  A positional leader is in nature a leadership role.  What isn't inherent in a positional leader is her or his ability to lead *well*?  One of the elements of this book I did appreciate were the pictures and quotes and the fact that the book is a quick read.  Other than that, I don't feel any more prepared now than I did prior to reading this book 
 I have to agree with just about everyone who has reviewed this book. It lacked an interesting story and even the sex left a lot to be desired. You could not get into either Devon or Jocelyn'a characters.  There was no spark between the two and the book made no sense at all.  The entire book just dragged on and on.  I could hardly wait to finish it.   
 One star is all Martin deserves for this book.  Instead of trying to discredit the Gospels, he attacks the creed's, which are held in high regard by the Christian churches, but are not essential to them.  He can't disprove Jesus' Christ existence based on physical evidence because there is none against it.  He therefore attacks it on philosophical/out-of-context grounds. He can try to come up with a new way to explain the empty tomb. I'll just say to have fun. 
 This movie should come with a prescription label that reads: "Take this film at bedtime as needed for sleeplessness."   Dear God, what a boring, montonous mess: Long, static shots of a townhouse that last minutes at a time; ambiguity and a frustratingly cryptic plot make this a very hard film to sit through. I don't need a movie to hold my hand and hit me over the head with answers, but for the love of God, reveal something interesting! The excruciating glacial pace makes Antonioni look like Michael Bay. Coffee was no cure; neither was a bag of chips. Sleep overcame me despite my greatest desire to watch and pay close attention to this movie.  The "startling moment" everyone describes is when one character slices his own throat, spraying blood everywhere. This scene is almost incongruous, since it is quick, violent, and horrifying, unlike the rest of the movie.  I have watched hundreds of foreign movies, and have liked most of them. However, CACHE is one of the worst I've seen. No resolution, no answers, incomprehensible, no likeable characters, impossibly slow. I want to know why the main character was getting those videos sent to him. And would someone please explain the last shot of the movie to me? It is a long shot (again) of a school entrance with kids going back and forth. Then the main character's kid and the Algerian's kid meet and talk to each other. So what? What the hell? I slept through this movie just to see this scene? I almost want to slash MY own throat for watching this self-indulgent exercise.   Supposedly this a movie about guilt and how it affects you your entire life. The director should feel guilty for foisting this nonsense upon the audience and shilling it at as a "suspense" movie. The only suspension I hold now is for movie review opinions that praise this movie endlessly. These people have to be kidding.  Oh, and the rooster who gets his head cut off in a flashback scene? At least he didn't have to sit through the rest of this movie fighting off drowziness and staring at interminable minutes of meaningless video of a townhouse 
 This book wasn't great. I don't like the format of this book the way it was written by several different contributors. I don't feel it has any particular flow or direction. It touches of some supplements and on the macro and micronutrients but doesn't outline any particular diets for anything. If you want to read a little about effervescent creatine, a little about protein, a little about calcium, and a little about a few other topics then I guess this book would be for you but you can find way better information in other books or online. I don't recommend this book 
 THE EVIL THAT MEN DO Nancy Holder (2000)  RATING:  2/5 Stakes  SETTING:  Season Three  CAST APPEARANCES:  Buffy, Joyce, Willow, Oz, Xander, Giles, Angel, Cordelia, Willy the Snitch, Devon, Sheila Rosenberg, Ira Rosenberg  MAJOR ORIGINAL CHARACTERS:  Helen, Julian (ancient Roman vampires); Jordan Smythe (flunky); Mark Dellasandra (high schooler); Nick Daniels (Bronze manager); Claire Bellamy (Bronze); Diana (ancient Roman Slayer)  BACK-OF-THE-BOOK SUMMARY:  "After a vicious shooting spree, the town of Sunnydale is shell-shocked.  What could have sparked the random rampage?  Buffy Summers can guess.  Considering the prophetic dreams she's been having, the Slayer suspects possession by an especially malevolent force.  As the police follow their typical false leads, the Slayerettes start up their own research into possible paranormal causes.  But when Oz's van is discovered on the side of the road, minus one teen wolf, a distraught Willow turns on Buffy, disrupting the investigation.  With the pressure in Sunnydale mounting, the residents' reactions to stress grow increasingly unpredictable.  The Slayer continues her search for answers, narrowly surviving an attack by a well-trained and powerful vampire who brought a gruesome death to every Slayer who crossed her path.  Is this the ancient creature behind the recent influx of evil?  Or is there another influence . . . close to home?"  REVIEW  	Set-Up:  What do you get when you mix Nancy Holder, two ancient Roman vampires, and a plot to raise an ancient deity to destroy the world?  Punchline:  An incredibly boring Buffy novel titled The Evil That Men Do.  I perhaps shouldn't be quite so harsh, as there is one or two good ideas in the novel, it's just that on the whole the book lacks energy, humor, surprises, creativity, and all of those other things one looks for in a good novel. 	Helen and Julian, two vampires from the age of Caligula, have waited several centuries for a chance to call forth the goddess Meter and rule the world.  When they hatch their vile scheme in Sunnydale, the water supply gets laced with an "everyone turn evil" drug, turning citizen against citizen as "all hell breaks loose."  Seriously . . .  it's just plain bad. 	Our Terrible Twosome of bad guys have standard villain personas:  Julian is the suave, cultured, smarmy James Bond movie villain, while Helen is the vicious, want-to-kill-everything-that-moves type of villain.  Their backstory is fairly interesting, even if it takes a while to get moving.  As for the Scoobies, they're all fulfilling their standard roles:  Cordelia gets kidnapped, Oz shapechanges, Buffy stakes.  The book just doesn't have much life to it, and should be avoided in favor of the many better ones out there.  [... 
 This is NOT a book!! It is a fold of about 25 half-size pages stapled in the center with a cover of card stock printed in black.  The information was totally ho-hum.  Common sense and an IQ of more than 20 will give you the same information with a quick look at the front of any book.  Then there's the cost!!!!!  $15.95 plus $3.49 shipping.  The book would have easily fit into a #10 business envelope and shipped for forty cents.  Needless to say I returned it ASAP 
 Disappointed with the written content. Too much irrelevant, adolescent street jargon.  Illustrations were poor as were the written descriptions of techniques. Overall a disappointing buy 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 Such a great show, if only the second season had music to match. 
 ...that they even made it this far and to 11. Seriously now, Kidz Bop has to stop ruining decent songs that a lot of people like. I'm pretty sure that these 20something idiots that give this 4 or 5 song reviews have no taste in music. What even shocks me more is that this sold really well in it's first week. You know the saying, IF IT AIN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT 
 This book is subtitled "A Philosophical Introduction", leading one to believe that you wouldn't have to be a philosopher to understand what the man is saying.  Blantant lie.  The book was completely confusing and needlessly verbose.  The author once used degrading in a sentence, and then defined "degrade" and how he meant it to be used in the next sentence.  He eithers thinks his readers incredibly stupid, or just feels the need to throw out definitions every chapter. Surrounding the needless definitions are complex philosophical arguments that take hours to break down and understand, this book is not an introduction to anything.  If you want to learn about race-thinking or the different arguments about the meaning of race, this is not the book for you 
 Eric Davin is a left wing nut case. Any thing he writes is really bad. I dont like the book. You would have to pay me to read it twice. I think he might still be upset that the USSR went capitalist. Poor Baby 
 I highly suggest anyone who wishes to believe the information in this book examine her sources of evidence, statistical studies, clinical trials,  and objective studies.  As with most critics of stimulant therapy in ADD patients, evidence is secondary concern 
 I bought this crap on a half whim/half single basis. I thought "when you sleep" was pretty good, so I decided to give the rest of the album a shot. First of all, "when you sleep" is very misleading. The entire album is much more mellow and sounds nothing like it, and had I known it was weird british crap, I would have passed anyway. Think Keane, but much MUCH worse. Not possible? I thought so, but I was wrong. There isn't anything rock or anthemic about it, its just badly produced brit-pop with annoyingly slow tempos. With this being the second awful CD I've purchased on a whim in the last month, I think it's time to take a break. Thanks Long-view, thanks alot. AVOID! 
 I'm not very satisfied with this book.  It's a very basic and also out of date version of Home Automation techniques.  It takes a very basic approach to home automation and does not offer much helpful info about current techniques. 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 Half paean to old-time radio, half murder mystery, this overly melodramatic WWII-era set novel lurches along for far too long before petering out, exhausted with itself. I've enjoyed Dunning's "Bookman" series, and I like historically set mysteries, so picking this up seemed like a no-brainer. But Dunning overextends himself with this one. The story revolves around Jack Dulaney, a down-and-out racetrack horse-walker who gets in a fight that lands him in jail. His buddy helps to spring him from a work gang, but is then killed. This is the catalyst for Jack's incredibly complicated search for the killer and reason behind the murder. The trail leads him to a New Jersey beach town and the radio station where his buddy used to work as an actor. There, further disappearances and deaths are revealed, including that of Carnahan, the father of the woman he pined for years before. As it happens, the woman is also in town, working as a nightclub singer under an assumed name. Jack manages to get work at the station as a writer, allowing him to poke around and try to get to the bottom of everything (not to mention rekindle his old flame).   Here is where the book starts to have real problems. Namely, all the detail about old-time radio production is far more fascinating than the murders. I'm not particularly (nor are most readers likely to be) interested in how dramatic radio shows were put together back in the '30s and '40s, but Dunning makes the station come alive and does a fascinating job of detailing the inner workings. From the scripting, to the management, the actors, the sound effects, it's all very well dramatized. So much so, in fact, that it's hard for the reader to care very much about the deaths of some characters met only very briefly or in flashbacks. The station's attempt to create original dramatic programming that pushed the limits of what was considered acceptable material--such as a scripted serial about black Americans, an anti-war prison camp series, and soforth--ends up being much more interesting. Unfortunately, the story eventually leaves the radio setting (via a lame piece of misdirection lifted from Hamlet) to dive into the world of German spies in America, the Irish Republic Army, and all manner of melodrama.  The melodrama is enhanced by a certain thinness to the characters. The protagonist is an especially poorly drawn hero figure with altogether too keen a resemblance to the hero of Dunning's "Bookman" series. He's one of those all-purpose strong, capable men. Street-fighting? No problem. Writing a critically well-received Steinbeck/Dos Passosesque novel? No problem. Escaping a work gang? No problem. Master writing radio drama overnight? No problem. Expert tracking through the woods? No problem. When the hero of a story turns out to be exceptional at everything, the whole story is diluted. Beyond Jack, the cast of characters is so large that Dunning doesn't really have the time or space to develop any of them in any meaningful way. It's not generally a good thing when the villain in a mystery is a character you can barely remember being in the story. This is a pity, because there are a number of characters with potential, and the old-time radio setting is certainly well done. As a historical novel about a small group of people striving in a creative field, it works fairly well--in no small part due to the subsequent total demise of the world depicted in the book. Just don't expect to pick this up and find yourself immersed in a thriller. 
 An anthology of this type should capture representative selections of all worthy poets; given that personal bias, I find this to be an unbalanced treatment of American verse.  Walt Whitman gets 68 pages (as though his work is not readily available elsewhere), while the entire contribution of Stanley Kunitz (just to note a single example) is reflected in one short poem--and many other fine poets are slighted in this lamentable fashion.  Glance through the table of contents and browse the volume itself, and you'll find tiny snippets of some of our best poets, engulfed by huge selections of the few that this editor considers laudable.   It's unfortunate that Oxford should have issued a biased and arbitrary selection of this sort, which is of very limited use to those interested in the breadth of achievement of American poets. Many other anthologies offer more generous selections of accomplished poets, and will, one imagines, be much more frequently consulted by readers looking for a favorite poem. 
 My 1st grader said it best: "Cute pictures, but scary story!" She had tears in her eyes as she realized the Mama was gone and the baby was alone. He gets a new mama when he's rescued, but the ghostly outline of his lost mother is present on the last page. Yikes. Terrible for little ones, brings up a whole host of frightening topics 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 The author used avidly personal examples, examples from others, quotes, and related scripture which illustrated themes in the principles Jesus taught to his disciples. This also aided in allowing the readers to relate the examples in the book towards their own personal life. The book also outlined that a questionnaire was sent out to 100 women and the book was based on the experiences those women had with mentoring.    I did not feel that this book was adequately categorized as a book that's primary focus on mentoring.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who is a mentor or contemplating whether or not to be a mentor. While this book did do a good job outlining how one can intertwine religion into mentoring it's it did not provide enough material for me to be able to learn from it's text and apply what I learned to a real life situation. 
 This book is garbage.  Absolute garbage.  I think Glannon's Civ Pro is great, and I have read many others that I can learn from.  I am in chapter 8 right now, and I have been searching the internet for a way to tell the company or the authors that this book sucks.  I visited the Aspen publishing webpage, but they don't give a crap, they just want to sell books.  THIS BOOK IS PATHETIC.  Wherever you are, Mr. Burke and Mr. Snoe, thanks a lot.  40 bucks for this crap.  I just hope I can resell it to somebody who didn't read this review.  
 This CD contains: 2 long remixes of The Hand That Feeds, the orginal song, and the music video.   The two remixes on this CD sound exactly the same and aren't all that good. It comes with the orginal version of the song "The Hand That Feeds" and also the music video (but in terrible quality). So you're basically buying 1 bad remix.  This is one of the worst NIN remix CDs I've ever heard. If you're not a hardcore fan (meaning, you don't own every Halo) then don't waste your time with this CD 
 I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises Ludlum's book "The Sigma Protocol". It says "In Ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy." Well gee. That's the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). Enter "ordinary man" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this. "The Aquitaine Progression" might make a half decent TV movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much

 Do not buy this product. The one I got was used three times and it quit. 
 I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...        
 This is a well written book.  And it is sincere.  So it may seem unfair that I'm giving it only one star.  I generally reserve that rating for books which are intentionally dishonest.  But I disagree so strongly with the logic of this book that I simply can't give it a higher rating than this.  This book does not recommend surrendering to Islamic terror.  It recommends fighting the terrorists intelligently and also trying to do something about the "causes of terror" which have become such a great tool for recruiting terrorists.  Well, I think that's a good idea as well.  And that's why I'm giving this book one star.  You see, in addition to taking on the real thugs, it also recommends making some really tiny concessions (if indeed they are considered concessions at all) that many people agree will really help us make fewer enemies among the common folks!  But in my opinion, these tiny concessions will probably cause the entire strategy to fail.  Furthermore, I think the reasoning that gets us to come up with the idea of such concessions will lead us to make many more mistakes.  The one area where the authors think we need to make a concession is in the Arab-Israeli conflict.  They have it all worked out.  Make sure that Israel's security is not threatened.  Let the Levantine Arabs have their freedom and sovereignty.  Defuse the whole issue for the whole Muslim world.  Achieve peace.  Everyone wins!   But I think this is the key to failure and that everyone will lose.  As I see it, this is a battle between forces which are demanding truth and human rights against those who demand the victory of preposterous and racist propaganda.  And any "resolution" of the conflict will mean dealing not with true representatives of the Arab people of the region (who might well argue in favor of something useful) but with a gang of self-proclaimed "representatives" who actually represent merely the demands of some racists for the removal of the human rights of Levantine Jews (and probably of other minorities as well).  I think that means there will be other tiny concessions, all of which will be carefully designed to preclude peace and to increase the chances of recruiting more terrorists.  The most significant tiny concession we'll be asked to make is, in my opinion, going to be to admit that the terrorists are Right.  That it is immoral for minorities to have human rights.  That the Enlightenment was immoral as well.  That scholarship is evil, especially scholarship in the field of history.  Basically, we'll be signing off on their propaganda and making it appear legitimate.  I doubt very much that the authors want us to do this.  But I feel very strongly that this is the only way we can get the "agreement" that the authors think will "defuse" the issue.  Oh, we'll pretend that we've done no such thing.  But we will have.  And if we do that, I think we will have lost a huge battle in a real war, even if our opponents quit using violence for a while in exchange.    I think the recommendations of the authors are simply wrong.  It might make sense to fight the terrorists and stand up for truth, scholarship, and human rights.  If we try it and win, billions of humans will be happier, and human society will be more prosperous.  It might even make sense to surrender to reactionary and racist terrorism, and give up on truth, scholarship, and human rights.  But I think we ought to make up our minds and pick a strategy.  And I think that what this book recommends will be worse than either choice 
 It seems like a good idea... 'Las Vegas Hillbillys,' a kind of a 'Krush Groove' for the possum pie and moonshine set, starring Jayne Mansfield and Mamie van Doren.  Duelling blonde bombshells, right?  Ah, no.  Van Doren is looking sad and puffy in this film as a 'tough' but disinterested saloon singer, longing for better days when she was straining angora sweaters and scratching out the eyes of good girls everywhere.  Jayne Mansfield sports a series of tentlike grandma dresses of the sort later found adorning the fashionable Weezie Jefferson, reading from cue cards with a kind of breathy, clueless abandon which is probably quite fetching when she's not dressed in a potato sack.  One can imagine her on her rendezvous with destiny, thinking, 'Oh no, we're about to slide underneath that semi truck!  But at least I won't have to think about 'Las Vegas Hillbillys' anymore.'  Between the two of them, they don't get more then seven minutes' screen time.  This movie is ostensibly a musical, in the sense that there is music in it, consisting of fifteen- or twenty-minute blocks of bad lip-synching (in an 85-minute film) which do nothing to advance the plot, such as it is.  Watch for Bill Anderson's all-KGB-agent backup band. 'We are American high-fashion models.'  I gave this movie a whole two stars because they *can* sing, after all... give them a break.  Richard Kiel makes a surprise appearance as, can you guess? a thug.  He actually has dialogue in this film, of a sort, and in watching his performance you really get a sense that unenthusiastically bunny-hopping between cable cars in 'Moonraker' represented the pinnacle of his acting career.  The plot: Woody Weatherby contemplates stardom, inherits a debt-ridden saloon from his uncle, goes to Vegas, tries to run the place, has a twenty-minute nap.  In the last ten minutes Aunt Clem magically fixes everything and starts a cream pie fight.  Van Doren kisses Ferlin Husky, thereby completing her descent to the innermost circle of Hades.  The End.  There was supposedly a sequel to this, 'Hillbillys in a Haunted House,' but I frankly am afraid to watch it.  Be my guest 
 I mean, come on. A blind golfer? I thought it was an intruiging premise, too, until I tried to hit balls with my eyes closed. I'm a 2-handicapper, and I was completely hapless. So forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down.   That said, Cullen writes a pleasant, if completely farfetched tale, with likeable characters. However, I thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf. The subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting, believable and touching, and the best part of the book was a short bit about Allegheny men and their pickup trucks.   
 I was looking for a book that would tie together the bits and pieces of LDAP knowledge that I had gathered from the internet for a thorough overview of LDAP.  But after reading this book, I still don't have a clear understanding of basic concepts such as namespaces.  One section led me to believe that a DNS-based namespace was the same as an LDAP hierarchical namespace, but then I had my doubts after reading another section.  Are cn, ou, dc, and uid all object classes?  I have heard that LDAP does not respond to a client with a pass/fail response, but there is a discussion of result codes in response to such operations.  What are theses codes?  When and how are they issued?  Walk the reader through from beginning to end with an example of connecting to an LDAP server with a query or an authentication request and show the messages that are passed back to the client (if any).  In a discussion of public key encryption, the author states: "the public key is published for anyone to know, whereas the private key is kept secret from everyone but the user....it doesn't matter who knows your public key, because the public key can't be used to impersonate you."  Please explain this apparent paradox; if I need the public key to decrypt your message, and anyone can have the public key, then how is the data secure?  Couldn't anyone tapping into our communication decrypt it if they have the public key too?  Including some actual PERL, or JSP, or VB.NET with ASP.NET scripts for connecting to and querying an LDAP server would have been a plus.    It is difficult to write a technical book that doesn't merely present a collection of technical facts (which I will take on faith as being accurate).  It is important to be able to state the facts plainly and connect them to form a coherent idea.  For example: "A workgroup is just a group of workstations that share a browse list."  I had read volumes about workgroups, workstations and browse lists in other books before finding this concise line (and many more like it) in a book by Mark Minasi.  There is nothing for the reader to ponder or second-guess with such a line - it is short and to the point.  As is, I didn't find a similar style in this book, nor did I find much information that isn't already freely available on the internet 
 ...and was left putting the book down every two seconds because I was annoyed by it. It is not marvelously written; in fact, I found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph, if not more (editor, please?). It's an interesting enough plot, but the way it's put forth is mindnumbing. The non-fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways. First, if the information had been summarized in about two pages. And second, if he hadn't pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities.   I'm usually a fast reader, but this book (a quick 415-page paperback read) took me more than a month, just because I had to keep putting it down. If you simply want something to "frighten" you, or are unusually interested with autopsies (there are about five million in the book), and don't care about poor writing, pick this book up 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 This album sucks. The song are soooooooo boring. it's just like listening to cold play but even cold play being on drugs, because sometimes people don't do things as well when they're drunk or on drugs. So, if cold play was on drugs they would not play good music and they already suck and levy is like way worse than cold play so what that does that say about their music. It's just so bad. the guitar player needs to take more lessons, maybe from the lead guitar player from new found glory becuase he rocks. ok that's all.  Jason Mitchel 
 Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you wouldn't even be here reading this review. These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded, dial, yellow wall phone.  If you are a recent (one hour ago) immigrant from a sixth world country, and you need to forward the "Burger King Christmas Song", well, then you're already ahead of these "learning" CDs.  (My apologies to grandmothers with corded, dial, yellow wall phones). (Actually, I kinda wish I had one!)  Regards,  Older But No Smarter 
 I'm such a big fan of Tori Amos and Kate Bush that I gave this album a chance to grow on me and really, really tried to like Charlotte too.  The problem is she sounds like such a knockoff of her influences all I can hear is her copycat style, no true depth or originality.  No offense to her fans but sorry, I have to agree with the minority here and say she needs to develop a little more of her own musical identity and stop sounding like her mentors.  If you think you like Charlotte but don't have all of Tori and Kate's work in your library yet, I suggest you start there. For now, I'll give Charlotte two stars for potential. 
 This Skip Spence Oar cd is really bad. To hear other peoples reviews it sounded like the best thing in the world. Its no wonder why this album was a flop when it came out. Thirty five years later it is not any better. 
 I do not like it when the book you are reading tells you "I will not go into this because I have explained it elsewhere." It seems impossible to get a good understanding of tummo (the inner fire) without reading Lama Yeshe's other books. The reader is redirected to other places to learn about the most essential information like specific mantras to complete the practices mentioned. We have lots of philosophical "good stuff" in this book, but when it comes to practice, oops! you need a flesh and blood guru, or better, another book by the same publications. 
 Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book.  Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility.  The title says "interpreting" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution 
 I just wonder if this would have been published without the author's being married to an author;  I find his stuff repetitively boring as well.  This is a simplistic story of an orphan wife who acts as though she can't stand her husband and seems to glory in anything she can do to upset him  Her friend in these endeavors is an obviously manic / depressive (sorry, term has been replace by bi-polar victim ) whose wealth seems to make her the star.  Their enemy is the EVIL (can't use that word either) Eagle Forum which is trying to close down the local store where the kids get their drug paraphanalia.  It seems that both ladies have problems (oops, not allowed any more by the political correctness police, I mean 'issues') with their male counterparts.  They act like they hate their husbands.  I'd recommend this to anyone who hates Religious people and loves to see kids getting in trouble with drugs.  A dog . .  
 This 600+ page endeavor in tedium has quite a few clever and witty observations about the current state of media, technology, etc., but is undone by the author's endless tone of self-congratulation and his complete inability to MOVE THE STORY ALONG. The plight of George and Lizzie is secondary to all of Andersen's cheeky observations and endless descriptive dreck. There's no sense rehashing the plot because there really isn't one. For a story intending to portray life in the modern fast lane, so little seems to actually happen, and it's hard to care about any of the characters since they serve mainly as props and time-killers in between the author's next clever zinger. Most of the time, the author's supposedly keen insight into the 21st century is no more than well-dressed but thinly-veiled cliches (this is particularly prevalent - and annoying - when the author shifts the setting out of New York City to the West Coast and shows his complete ignorance of anything outside the 212 area code), and you get the distinct impression that the author is writing just to hear himself talk. Fresh and invigorated at the start, it doesn't take long for Turn of the Century to wear thin and dwindle to a boring, lethargic crawl. All in all, a very disappointing read, since I was always a fan of his work in Spy Magazine. This is precisely the kind of "hip, cutting edge" fiction - with it's media barbs and heavy handed approach to social satire - which would fool critics into thinking the author really had something to say 
 In the right hands this novel could be translated into an exciting movie.  The premise is interesting, but falls completely flat with the sewn up ending.  A true happily ever after, that begs for a more smartly written sequel in which everything unravels would be delicious.  The hardest aspect to swallow was that this super extra terrestrial life form could divide out of control then just be neatly killed and carried to a lab in the desert for benevolent study.  Sheesh!  I really thought it was going to get scary at some point! The major antagonist of the story is a tattoed up ex inmate who fancies himself a master mind killer-when in reality he is just a sharpshooting (except when it really counts) boob!  And boy does he meet his match in a simple pair of desert folk, who happen to be expert gunslingers and survivalists to boot!  This is all very funny, but to me the funniest part of the entire book is the description of the male tyrannasaur mounting the female and trumpeting loudly in the wild prehistoric world he inhabits!!!! 
 This was a quick read, but it could have been written so much better.  The conversations between Sharde and Jeff were filthy, unrealistic and a bit overdone (full of the f-word, c-word, p-word, etc.). I know this is a work of fiction, but new lovers would not talk to each other this way so early in the sexual relationship, unless someone was getting paid!   Ms. Lee needs to mix it up and be more creative with her word choices to keep the text from being repetitive and annoying. Both Jeff & Clay constantly referred to Sharde as "honey" and Jeff used the phrase "holy hell" at least 10 times.   Sharde had no self-respect and came off as being a needy black chick and was willing to let Jeff do any and everything to her. The sex between them was just nasty. Jeff requested something from Sharde that he couldn't get from his ex-wife and fiancee, who were both white. Interracial romance can be done without feeding into racist sexual stereotypes. 
 Other reviews of this book generally say things like "This book is so inspirational!" but none of the reviews really give a good idea of what this book actually says. The reviews for this book could easily be transposed with those for others, such as for books by Norman Vincent Peale, and no one would know the difference. Therefore, I would like to give a summary of what this book actually says.   In the first chapter, the author tells how he was on a cruise ship and suddenly made up his mind that he would be invited to sit at the captain's table. I thought the power of belief was just to motivate your own actions, but sure enough, your beliefs can cause other people to behave the way you want them to, because the next day the Capt. invited the author to sit at his table. The first chapter also suggests that perhaps a person can regrow a lost arm or leg if he simply makes up his mind to. In Chapter 5 he tells a story of a woman who found that all the traffic lights always turned green as her car approached them!  A word of caution, however. The author says in Chapter 3, "in order to awaken these marvelous powers you must ask for something that is rightfully yours (?) and is within your ability to handle" "For the subconscious manifests itself only in accordance to the capabilities of the person. Well, this seems very obvious. Naturally you'll only be able to accomplish what is within your capabilities. But I thought the whole purpose of this book was to extend your capabilities. Hmmm, seems kind of like an easy "out," or an excuse for the author if it doesn't work.   Also the author says that once the solution occurs to you, you must carry it out with no hesitation, deliberation or mental reservation. But this contradicts the advice he gives on page 110 of the paperback edition where he says "Beware of hunches that would lead you into untried fields that may not be hunches at all, but just sudden fanciful longings"!   In chapter 5 the author says "Many engaged in wishful thinking, but wishful thinking in itself is without effect simply because the power factor is missing," but was not the idea of the captain would invite him to sit at his table merely wishful thinking? So why did that work?   This book also contains advice that could be dangerous: in Chapter 5, the author tells of a woman who took a long automobile trip against the advice of her mechanic who suggested that her tires were bald and should be replaced. Nevertheless, she took the trip anyway and, because she "believed", her car did not suffer a blowout. She never did replace the tires, even though she admitted they were "in pretty bad shape".   In another part of the book, the author talks about a great military leader who strongly believed he would triumph, but failed anyway. This is because the belief of the opposing side counteracted his own beliefs. So beliefs can be counteracted by opposite and opposing beliefs. But surely 250 million Americans never believed their country would be attacked on September 11th 2001, so why did the beliefs of a few hijackers counteract the beliefs of 250 million people? Also, why did the Titanic sink when the 3000 or so passengers on board believed it was an unsinkable ship? These may be silly questions, but they're no more silly than believing that the Capt. will invite you to his table just because you think he will. 
 This book appears to be a description of how independently wealthy people live in New York, and, oh, there's a "mystery" or something going on. Predictable plot, inflatable characters, silly premises and a sudden but boring "twist" at the end -- this book is resoundingly mediocre and a chore to make it through. I recommend it only if you're having trouble getting wet logs to catch on fire but make sure you remove the plastic-coated jacket 
 Let me begin with the positives: --the recipes are (mostly) tasty and quick  --the exercises will really kick your butt  On the food front, Austin seems stuck in a rut of outdated 80s dieting (i.e. lowfat, high carb, etc). I am glad she mentions staying away from faux sugar (Splenda, NutraSweet, etc) and has favored real butter previously (though she now recommends some weird butter/canola oil hybrid I have no use for). Personally, I use real butter in small amounts and my fiance must use Smart Balance (the only non-hydrogenated butter replacement on the market that I know of because he is allergic to dairy). At any rate, her recipes were quick to prepare and most of them actually pretty tasty, but BE WARNED! If you are using these recipes to cook for anyone else but yourself, the amounts of items she gives in the grocery lists will feed only one person, so get double the amounts called for (or triple or quadruple, etc) based on your needs. All the recipes were for only one person (except a few, which she says makes 2 servings, but then you are supposed to save half of the recipe to use later, but she never specified when), so whenever I cooked for my fiance and me, I had to double the recipes on my own. It would be most helpful if she would include different amounts (in both the shopping lists and in the recipes) based on the standard increments of 1, 2, or 4 people. Also, if you follow her book religiously as far as buying the food goes, you will end up with an entire loaf of bread bought in the first week that, at the end of the second week, never got used. I'm glad I put the extra bread in the freezer right when I got it; otherwise, it'd have gone to waste.   The layout of the book is a little annoying; you have to flip from one section (the menu plan) to the section containing the recipes for that day. If you do end up buying all the food she recommends in the first chapter, be warned that some of it will go to waste. After all, it's difficult to buy just the amount of mushrooms needed for one person for one meal at the grocery store. I don't know where you shop, but where I shop, mushrooms come packaged in a pint-sized shrink-wrapped container. You can't just buy a handful. Fully half of the mushrooms have not yet been used and I'm pretty sure they've already gone bad. I also bought a cucumber, half of which also went to waste because there were no other recipes that used cucumbers the rest of the week. Cucumbers, as you probably know, don't exactly have a long shelf life.  Also, if like my fiance, you are unable to eat dairy, you will find it difficult to be on the diet. She uses nonfat yogurt and skim milk and reduced fat cheese all the time (not to mention the dreaded soy cheese). If you are unable to consume dairy, you will have to be creative about substitutions (which by the way, she does not help out with...never mentions any substitutes). So we ended up using rice milk, soy yogurt, and smaller amounts of real cheese in the recipes for my fiance (he can tolerate very small amounts of real cheese, provided it's mixed with other things and he consumes less than, say, 1/2 cup worth).  That aside, her diet looks down on the application of salt. She claims that too much salt can cause water retention and bloating. Unfortunately, food without small amounts of salt (preferrably sea salt) often lacks flavor. Toward the end of my two week run on this book, I was adding a sprinkle of salt here and there without any ill effects. What DID affect me in a bad way as far as bloating goes are all the bean and fiber-heavy dishes. Beans, lowfat-everything and lots of veggies are held by the mainstream media and vegetarians everywhere to be the best thing for health, but unfortunately in my case, I find this to be untrue. However, I was desperate to lose the slight paunch I have always had under my belly button (I'm a pear-shaped gal). So I ate her recipes...followed them religiously. The upshot? I started bloating, having gas pains, was constipated. And before you blame the salt, let me tell you that I was having problems with gas and bloating well before I put any added salt in the recipes. Also, I've managed to eat salt all my life and not get bloated. It's not the salt.  My fiance, who can handle much larger amounts of carbs than me, was also having bloody stools caused by the influx of far too much fiber. Too much fiber can cause bulky stools which stretch the intestinal walls.[...]  Ever wonder why whole wheat bread (or in my case, pitas) cause gas but white flour bread does not? Whole wheat has plenty of fiber. One whole wheat pita probably is OK, but after a whole day of eating raw veggies and beans, a whole wheat pita might push you over the edge into bloating and irritated bowels.  So the diet itself is not good if, like me, you can't handle large amounts of unrefined carbs. I'm also not impressed with her ill-considered position on soy products. She liberally uses soy cheese (I used fat free singles instead and can't wait to get back to real cheese) and tofu. There are several studies indicating that soy is not the miracle product it was touted to be. Aside from that, since her diet is so dairy heavy in the first place, why the soy cheese? It's not any lower in fat that regular American singles so why use it? I notice she doesn't advocate the use of soy yogurt (which my fiance used instead of the regular and he hated it...said it tasted like chalky pudding...and it did. I tried it. Yuck.)  Anyway, I can't really recommend the whole program, only the exercises. I think I would get a DVD of these tummy toning exercises and just stick to my Weight Watchers program (by the way, eating her entire daily menus puts you over your daily Points if you are doing both. I ended up not being able to eat a snack or have the extra glasses of milk she lists because they went over my Points for that day).  I really did give this program the old college try for two weeks. I found her recipes tasty and quick, but bloat-inducing.   I do believe that different people need different types of food. Apparently, my body benefits from a lower carb, higher protein diet as that what makes me feel best. You may do well on her program, especially if you already eat a lowfat and high carb, high fiber diet and thrive on it.  
 This book had a good premise, but never got of the ground. Every time that I thought that something was going to get the ball rolling, it never happened.  I think that Ms. O'Dell has some talent, she is very descriptive about the setting and such, but the meat of the story was boring. 
 She has the sensibilities and personality of someone from the 19th century. Completely without wit or charm or intelligence. The reader is *told* that Molly's smart because she's been to university, but there's absolutely no evidence of it. In fact, she's perhaps one of the stupidest heroines I've every had the displeasure of reading about. Not to mention that fact that she's spineless. I felt like kicking her 
 I've been a fan of the Dirk Pitt novels for years now, picking up Raise the Titanic back when it was first released.  If this book is an example of the future of the series, I think I'm not going to be buying any more.  The writing is fairly poor and the plot is fairly by the numbers.  It's a sad day for technothriller writers, the Soviet Union is gone, Islamic terrorists are off limits, and China just doesn't seem much of a threat.  Somehow, North Korea just doesn't inspire the same dread in the reader.  Beyond that, haven't we gotten past the point where any novel or movie outside of Austin Powers should have the bad guys decide to execute the good guys by stuffing them in a trap that will (literally, in this book) take hours to complete AND leave them completely alone to saw their way free with a nail file?  I kid you not, staked out in a cave waiting for the tide to swamp them they saw through their manacles with a nail file.  Never mind that the NK are going to launch a rocket laden with biologic agents and the US can't spare a F-16 or two to intercept over the course of half an hour, nor can the NUMA guys simply crash their blimp into it.  The Dirk Pitt novels were pulp, but they were good pulp.  This novel simply isn't in their league 
 I read On the Road over 30 years ago in college. I was hooked and within two years I read everything JK had written. I bought a first edition of Visions Of Cody some years later and found it a monumental bore. While I'll nod to the readers that get off on the experimental nature of the prose, for someone like me, who thinks On The Road and The Dharma Bums are almost perfect, Cody is not much more than the rough cut...very rough...for On The Road 
 I felt very irritated by reading this book. Many analogies and side stories lead to loose the focused main subject. Stories always diverge, never converge to any meaningful understanding. Avoiding equations and narrative description of the content of equations rather makes even difficult to understand. Simply showing equations is much better. A very badly organized poor book 
 I know Wendy has a huge following on her blog, but I have tried and tried to read her blog and her book, and it just doesn't inspire me to read on, or to follow her blog.  There are so many knitters out there who have engaging writing styles, and authors of knitting books who do as well (Stephanie Pearl-McPhee comes to mind), that I simply can't see spending my knitting and spinning time on one that isn't as engaging and entertaining.  This is one of two books about knitting or spinning I regret having ever bought 
 This album is strictly for the truest keith fans. The only reason one should own this album is for the sake of just having it. This is just a bunch of junk that was definatly not good enough for any of his classic joints. I am a giant keith fan, way back, but I only listen to this CD to make the other CDs seem even tighter. Its good for a laugh here and there. But if your trying to decide on a Keith disc to purchase, hit up any of the others, not this one. 
 I am beginning to think that I got a used product that was not good to begin with.  I have had nothing but trouble from the start.  We have many other just like this and have never had a problem.  This has been very frustrating 
 If you claim to be Catholic but fail to subscribe to the Catholic Worker newspaper you are not Catholic. (available here)  If you claim to be Catholic yet support directly or indirectly the Iraqi war, you are not Catholic (read Gaudium et spes, Pacem in terris, Father John Dear)  Forget this externalist formalist farcical treatment of the one holy catholic and apostolic Church.   To know what it is to be Catholic in the flesh and heart and spirit, study the writings of Sister Ita Ford, or her bio by Sr. Noone. Study Benedictine Sister Joan Chittister, or Monica Hellwig.   Be a true (not just practicing) Catholic and study deeply the great American CAtholic theologian and scholar, the Rev. Father Richard McBrien's comprehensive tome: Catholicism, well received and respected for a generation.   Continue with other great Catholic and American theologians and scholars and saints and contemplatives such as Jesuit Fathers Daniel Berrigan and Father John DEar who dare ask the hard questions with intelligence, insight and spiritual orthodoxy to the Gospel of Jesus. In particular illuminating is Jesus the Rebel by the Rev. Father Dear, and the commentaries on the Old Testament prophets such as Job and Ezekial by the Rev. Father Berrigan.   Then neither Dummy nor Complete Idiot shall you be, but Catholic in mind, heart, spirit and soul. Continue with the great Saint, MArtyr and Confessor of the Faith, Archbishop Romero, and of course the other Salvadoran martyrs and confessors like Fr. Ellacuria and the still living (when last seen) Father Jon Sobrino.    Such a telling shame cornerstone Catholic texts such as Pope John XXIII's PACEM IN TERRIS and Pope PAul VI's POPULORUM PROGRESSIO or even the US Conference of Catholic Bishop's ever-more-important treatise on Just Cause/Just war entitled GOd's Challenge and Our Response are out of print and no longer available, as they truly call us to put our faith into concrete action for Christ. As the great St. James wrote: Faith without works is dead.   Please check my other reviews for further excellent sources as well as warnings about the ill sectarian and shallow observances.  
 Scientology is a dangerous cult and Szasz is one of its biggest supporters. And some believe you should just change your lifestyle and you can rid yourself of Cancer, too.  Most rational scientists and mental health providers know that many different types of therapy--changing personal conduct as well as medicine and therapy--work, oftentimes very well together. Beware ANYONE who says: This is the only way 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 The book Ethan Frome was incredibly good: the environment was created as a character, the people were characterized amazingly, and Edith Wharton (the author) forced sympathy toward Ethan and Mattie's "affair", which never extended beyond a kiss.  The movie is horrible. Patricia Arquette appears to need speech therapy, and Liam Neeson's "limp" is more hilarious than telling. Their affair is much less believable, and by the end of the book, the only character that seems to be worthwhile is Zeena. Poor acting skills, poor script, and poor filming techniques all contribute to one horrible movie.  It's too bad, really. They are quite good actors otherwise; this movie is just absolutely horrible.  My favorite "love scene" between Ethan and Mattie: Mattie: (giving speech) I can't remember the rest. Ethan: You're cold. Mattie: Goodnight.  Awww....  Rent it for a laugh. Otherwise, avoid it like Bill and Hilary avoid each other in public 
 The X-Men fighting dinosaur men in the Savage Land. A good story with this plot is impossible. To be fair, Claremont's run on this series seems to be a throwback to the style of the eighties, and plots like this did occur in the X-Men of the eighties. However, this kind of story represents the extremely bad and cheezy side of eighties comics that people make fun of. This easily ranks as one of the worst X-Men stories I've read.  The reason I gave this two stars instead of one is for the last couple of issues, which are actually quite good. One is Psyclocke dealing with her return home, which spans the X-Men's return from the Savage Land through Wolverine: Enemy of the State and X-Men: Phoenix Endsong. The other is a fairly amusing issue featuring Mojo, although I'm not sure how he's alive, since last I saw he was killed in X-Men #11. His return could have been a story in a spin-off X-book or another Marvel title, however. All in all, I would only recommend this book for completists (like myself)or if you'd rather not go to a comic shop and pick up the last two issues of this volume individually 
 Pages 73 to 120 were misaligned at the printers and the top half the pages were cut off and the bottom half were glued in. This means you won't have about a third of the basics section, including the entire outdoor section, and a good deal of the Auckland section 
 I didn't have high expectations for this movie, yet it still managed to completely disappoint me.  I adore Robin Williams, and his performance was the best part of the movie.  But the script was abysmal and Sara, played by Marcia Gay Harden, was a completely one dimensional character.  The antics of the sidekick robot and the "flubber" itself were just plain embarrasing to watch.  Too bad, because the idea is great - but frankly, the original was pretty bad too. They really could have done so much with this story either the first OR the second time around 
 I don't recommend you make purchases here. I spent $61 on these items and have only recieved two. There has been no explanation as to what happened to the rest of my order, or my money. Patiently I've waited for over a month for my items to arrive and nothing 
 If your purpose is to learn something. This book is really bad at teaching you.  The author assumes many things. He has no idea of building things in a gradient. He leaves out the details of how something was arrived at.  If his purpose is to show off, then he has achieved. If his purpose is to create a text that is readable and understandable. He has failed.  
 After reading the first few pages of the book I realized that I was back in my Graduate class at Utep. I was expecting something more and different from Dr. Perez 
 Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.  It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.  If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history. 
 I'm not sure what I expected, but I found this CD to be a huge disappointment.  Sizzla is an acquired taste, and I haven't acquired the taste buds yet.  
 I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details.  I want to see how this dang series ends...will it?    This particular installment of the Dragon et. al. left me feeling underwhelmed.  The ending was a disappointment, but I'll press on and order book 8.  
 She took all of this from other authors. Even her section of how to eat chocolate is strangely reminisant of Will Clower's (The Fat Fallacy) Chocolate Eating Lessons concept.  She makes umpteen references to the French and how they eat -- which I am sure she got from French Women Don't Get Fat.  She isn't sure which book she is writing - her Wear More Cashmere book or this one. This book has a few too many references to the Cashmere book not to feel like an advertisement for it. The exercise portion isn't very practical -- unless you have a pool, a dance partner, fencing studio or horse stabled nearby. She talks about her old money upbringing enough to be tiresome...and so you just know that she has never had to try to fit exercise around a full time job.        She has some good ideas but unfortunaltey they are someone else's. 
 This is a much more challenging listen that "Dummy" but ultimately nowhere near as satisfying. The main problem is the mix - the sound on this is bone dry and Beth sounds like she's singing in another room. It's a pretty unique sound but very alienating and it hurts the songs. The other problem is that you just can't listen to this after having heard the "Roseland NYC Live" CD. The versions on that CD of the songs from this album are so superior to the versions here that it's not even funny. I heard NYC Live before I heard this and I think that's a big reason why I have never been able to get into this album. All in all, I agree with the other reviewer who said that "Dummy" and "Roseland NYC Live" complete the Portishead picture and this is really unnecessary if you have those two albums. Actually, NYC Live is probably their best release. I would recommend that to newcomers as ALL of the performances on that are improvements on their studio counterparts and it contains all of their best songs with the exception of "Numb" 
 In an impulsive moment, I bought this book on the strength of its Amazon pairing with that other book about the pharmaceutical industry, and the five-star reviews. And only after reading it do I wonder how many of those reviewers might be associates of Dr. Kassirer himself. This is not a five-star book, folks; it is one long smear from beginning to end that seems to paint the entire medical profession with the same sticky, filthy brush. Yes, there is a fair amount of spice along the way--isn't that always true of "exposes"?--but the whole seems much less than the sum of its parts. For my money, there isn't NEARLY enough hard data here to support the sorts of dour conclusions the author would have us accept on his say-so. 
 Some of chapters (specially at the beginning of the book), are quite good and I found interesting information in them. But the rest are very poor, and can do more harm, than good to one who reads them.  Some code snippets, even if they work, are very good examples how you SHOULD NOT WRITE programs. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, who doesn't have some experience in .NET programming and expects to learn from it. But it is quite good reference for the exam. I don't think, you will be able to pass exam using this book alone (unless you know .NET so well, you don't need any book to pass it :-)) 
 I ordered several ink cartridges at one time and was appalled when I received a slew of large boxes to deliver my order. The increased cost of shipping the cartridges separately made one magenta cartridge go from $9.35 to $14.93. All the cartrides arrived within a day of each other. I would rather pay for one shipment rather than separate ones. 
 As the mom of a 25-month-old late-talker, I have been searching high and low for information to help my child with his delayed speech.  Sure, this book was entertaining; these kids are indeed fascinating.  But after reading the Einstein Syndrome, it was clear that my boy is not one of the children Sowell is describing. Overall this book left me with more questions than answers on the subject of delayed speech.    If you actually want to do something to help your child, and not just read about other kids who turned out to be super-intelligent engineers, buy "The Late Talker: What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet" by Marilyn C. Agin, M.D., Lisa F. Geng and Malcolm J. Nicholl.  This is a book that gives parents real answers about how to help their speech-delayed children 
 This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting 
 This review is of the HANS-FRIEDRICH MUELLER edition published in 2005 by Modern Library. Simply, the book is defective, the pages tear out of the spine. I thought it was a one-off and returned for an exchange and had the same problem. I returned it again and instead bought the 2003 edition (Modern Library, Mueller) which is not as thick; it has fewer, larger pages, the spine holds together as it should. The problem with the 2005 edition is the spine is so thick because the pages are smaller the perfect binding seems to fall apart, probably a fault of the printer. I dont know if they are all like that, but the 2003 edition is IMO exactly the same just not as thick and easier to open and read 
 If you follow my writing, you know that I thought Part 1 and 2 were pretty good; I did NOT like this 3rd chapter; I liked 4 and 5 fairly well; 6 was my absolute favorite; I did not like part 7; part 8 had some redeeming aspects; and I have some respect for "Jason Goes to Hell." I know some people liked this third chapter, and they are entitled to their opinion. But I was utterly repulsed by this disgusting chapter. This 3rd chapter takes off just about where part 2 left off, and Jason claims another 2 victims. We then meet the next group of Jason's potential victims. This could have been a decent chapter except for what is to follow. With the possible exception of Kris and Shelly, this group of teenagers or young adults is so flat and 2d. There really is no getting to know them. Shelly and Kris go shopping and run into an obnoxious cycle gang. Shelly is a shy person who is unhappy with himself. He accidentally hits one of their cycles. When the gang leader breaks Shelly's windshield (or to be more accurate, the windshield of the car his friend loaned him), Shelly gets angry, chases the gang leader with the car and crushes his cycle. (The one and only redeeming element in this movie.) The cycle gang follows Shelly and want to burn down the barn to get even. They are so obnoxious and repulsive, we almost can't wait for Jason to kill them. And when he does, I doubt the average viewer will feel any sympathy for these 3 rotten people. Later, Kris tells about her past with Jason. (This was a little before Part 2.) Of course, Jason begins to kill the rest of the kids. Because they are so flat and 2d in this 3rd chapter, we don't really feel for them. Another annoying aspect of this film is that the murders are especially disgusting and vile in this 3rd chapter. (To be sure, I know this is suppose to be a horror, and that some people probably liked that aspect of it.) But even violence and murder can be filmed with a certain amount of taste. (In "Saturday Night Fever" Director John Badham did what he could to film a rape scene with at least some degree of taste! And let's be honest. In a way, rape is worse than murder.) As most of you know, Jason finds his hockey mask in this chapter. Well, following the typical formula, one person survives and manages to flip the tables on Jason. Since zero stars is not an option, I'll justify my 1 star rating the best I can. (The decent scene where Shelly runs over the cycle and the fact that Jason dispatches this obnoxious cycle gang warrant the one star.) I'll conclude by saying that if you don't have a problem with 2d flat characters and especially disgusting murders, then you probably will enjoy this 3rd chapter more than I did. Thank goodness for parts 4, 5, and 6! 
 This book might have been okie if not for the fact it talked to the reader as if they had not passed a second grade reading level. This book had one redeeming quality, the decriptions of the Gods and Goddesses in the back.  That's it. The rest can be treated with a pinch of salt 
 I like the information about baby massage. But other than that??? This book made me feel like an utter failure as a new mother. My son doesn't fit in ANY of her categories for babies and I am with the other reviewers who don't agree with her dislike of 'attachment parenting'. I love my son and I relish every moment of my time with him. If cuddling him before he goes to sleep is bad, then I'll be 'bad'. I'm sorry, but this woman needs to get off her high horse and come to grips with reality. Babies aren't going to go to sleep by telling them, "I'm putting you down for a sleep. You know how much better you feel afterward." PLEASE! Don't waste your time with this book. 
 Those who wrote positve stuff about this book, please tell me why nobody even mentioned that the authors did not give the answers to all the excises in the book? I just can not believe this, am I missing something here? Is this a math book? What am I supposed to do now with those questions 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 After her mother's mysterious death in India, Gemma Doyle is sent to a boarding school in England. Gemma is troubled by her mother's death and the strange visions that she is receiving. At Spence Academy, she feels like an outsider until her magical powers manifest themselves in the ability to travel to another realm. Things unravel as Gemma has to separate evil from good.  This book is written in as a first-person-present-tense narrative, which makes it very awkward to read. The point of a novel is to tell a story, not to think it. Besides--who thinks in coherent sentences? There are several inconsistencies in the writing tense which should have been caught by the editor.   The characters are at times inconsistent. They seem more like girls of the 21st century than the 19th. The girls can't seem to make up there minds whether to be 'blushing maidens' or not. One minute they are blushing at the mere mention of the word "chastity", and the next they are joking about sex over a bottle of whiskey. The general behavior of the characters would have been more realistic if the setting had been the 20th or 21st century rather than the late Victorian era.   A weak point with this book is the magic itself. The sources are never fully explained, and suddenly finding Gemma flying up a staircase was disorienting. The idea was good, but all explanations were vague and confusing.  The entire novel is inconsistent and sensationalized. I felt as if Ms. Bray had created this novel then thrown in some corsets and etiquette to create a sort of modern, Victorian-Gothic, melodrama. The overall effect is weak and unsatisfying.  
 I am reading this book for 10th grade. I normally don't find many books boring, but this one is as boring as they get. I found the plot was just lame. It's like following a guy through a few years of his life. I found this book boring, but it was easy too read 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" puts this novel to shame. It has an interesting premise, but it's so unbelievable (even for fiction!) that I could hardly get through to the end. Gregory is a capable writer, so the descriptions are good, but despite some promising fictional characters (like Hannah), I found the novel dead boring 
  Very disappointed by Canon on the fit of this adapter.  Adapater and shade attachments block camer lens view and create flash shadows  
 WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SUE HENRY?  THIS BOOK IS SUCH A LET DOWN; I ALMOST THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD SOMEONE ELSE WRITE IT -- THE STORY IS FLAT AND THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES ARE CONFUSING.  SORRY TO SAY THAT I REALLY CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS EVEN THOUGH I WANTED TO 
 We bought this lunch box (2 times now) and my son of course loves it.  I liked that it came with its own tupperware and cup.  My problem with this box is that my son is three, so of course completely independent, and the lunch box is not as durable as one would like.  He has dropped it twice, and both times it has broken, once the clips to close it fell off and the other a big hole in the bottom.  I feel that it should be a little more durable given its clientel. It is however his favorite. 
 This CD is the worst "comedy" CD I have ever heard.  Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious????  Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk.  I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this CD.  You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or when to laugh.  And it continues throughout the entire CD.  There don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all.  It is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being.  Don't believe me?  Then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself.  Like my review title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews.  Just read the negative ones, and decide how credible they seem.  Then make your decision to buy or not buy 
 Having enjoyed Kellerman's Delaware stories,I happened on this one and was stunned by his cultural/racial bias.  It is astounding how often the Arabs, Turks, Bedouins, Muslims are described as "sweat stained," "filthy," "lazy" and "shiftless."  The idiot Arab boy and the dishonest shop keepers are typical.  The Israelis are always industrious, clean, eager to do the job. The "good" Arab detective, Mahoud, isn't even Muslim--he's Christian!  The description of the 1947 and 1967 wars are difficult to consume, knowing the complexity of the issues then.  This was an old (1988) book, and one hopes that Kellerman will stick to his detective/psychologist stories 
 If you are a fan of Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, and Mr. Darcy in particular, do not buy Mr. Darcy's Daughters.  I had to force myself to finish the book, even while trying to keep an open mind and not expect it to be of the same caliber of Pride and Prejudice.  The story is weak, the characters forgettable.  If I'd read the reviews here first I wouldn't have bothered with the book.  There were many extraneous characters in the novel, love interests develop late and with little or nothing to support them.  There are more references to sex than I think is in line with a sequel to a Jane Austen novel.  I also found it strange that any children of Mr. Darcy (let alone five of them) would choose to show little regard for how their behavior affected their standing in good London society.  At least Mr. and Mrs. Darcy are out of the country for the duration of the novel and are spared the humiliation of making an appearance in such a second-rate piece of work. 
 Here's a sampling from "The Iron Dragon's Daughter"  "Behind the bar was an enormous glass tank, lit by harsh fluorescents, where the rest of the club was bathed in red and purple. A horse was drowning in the tank. Legs churning up clouds of bubbles. Eyes bloodshot and wild, it craned it's neck to lift agonized nostrils above the thrashing surface. The music was slow and romantic, but just loud enough that the horse struggled in silence."  That is obscene. It made me physically ill to where I was sweating and sick my stomach. And we wonder why violence and abuse are becoming excepted/excusable behaviors. This sort of stuff, imo, doesn't help.  Swanwick ought to be ashamed of himself for even having such thoughts let alone putting them in a book where 70% of its readers will be kids.  What's a kid, or anyone for that matter, suppose to make of that bar w/ drowning horse scene? What's MS trying to say? That hey! slowly KILLING an innocent creature is COOL entertainment. All it said to me was just how much of a sick SOB Swanwick is.  Everybody in this book uses the "F" word along with every other foul word you can think of, copiously. The higher the page# the higher the "F" count.  I don't care what you're trying to do with a story, foul language will destroy, not enhance it. Just like in real life, foul language demeans and destroys. That's what it's all about.   In class one day Jane's teacher ("fat old Grunt") "Thrust his hand between her legs and snatched up at her crotch. The class convulsed with mirth, all of them braying, snorting, snickering, laughing as if they had never seen him pull this joke before."   Huh?    This is the rudest, crudest, foulest sci/fi fantasy book I've ever read.  AND to top it all off .. THERE IS NO STORY!  There is no rhyme nor reason.   Whether Swanwick likes it or not, as an author of mostly kid read books he has, imo, some moral and social responsibility. He dropped the ball here.  I've never given censorship a thought until this book.  But I'm asking my library to pull it off our shelves. I admit, I don't want anyone, especially kids, to read this book. It's pure ugly evil. It shats on you. It's an insult to your intelligence.   Of course Swanwick is laughing all the way to the bank.    
 I never write reviews, but I had to make my comments on these socks. I bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work.  I put them on and turned the switch to high.  They DO NOT EVEN GET WARM at all...I thought it was broken, but realized it was both socks that didn't get warm. These are a total rip off and I am going to try and send them back.  
 I have to admit that I gave up on this book.  I'm hoping to find a more readable biography of Mrs. Roosevelt.  Cook's style and grammar are just too jumbled for me.    Look in the "look inside this book" section here and go to page 14.  This is a prime example of Cook's overuse of quotes.  I appreciate that she did her research, but if she was going to quote so much, she should have just included one whole article.  As it is, the whole page is a mish-mash of sentances and words taken from various sources creating a confusing unreadable mess.   
 The camera operates good, but I thought it was suppose to be new.  It looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom.  It does work, but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out 
 There are helpful recipes on the bottle, however the stopper is not secure. I do not feel safe storing fresh made salad dressing in my refridgerator in this bottle 
 While it's true that we sometimes need to be reminded of commonsense principles, the childish drivel contained in this book is of little value to any sane individual. I regret having wasted my time reading it. Body language, I've found, doesn't require much of a dicussion outside of the brief summary contained in most social skills books. Understanding what people say, whether to you or in general, and the hidden meanings in their tone, inflection, etc. is also of paramount importance. If you are looking to improve your social skills, I recommend the host of other bestselling books on the topic, including those by Dave Lieberman and Bob Bodenhamer 
 This is the worst idea a band has ever had. In particular, "damaged goods" is destroyed, removed of all of its original amazing tension. What we have now is an accomplished pub band rehashing past glory. Sad sad sad. Ladies and gentleman, give me Interpol over this. It pains me to say this. 
 I purchased this for my 4 year old son because he LOVES to take pictures.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money, however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use.  Not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working.  However, when it did work every single picture was blurry.  There is only one button for every option and it is very confusing.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It is being returned 
 This book is accurate as a blind folded archer spun 3 times in a game of pinata. There is no real useful info in this book, you'd get more tactics out of a Steven Seagal film. This book should be taken out of print before some dummy hurts themselves. If you're interested in learning the tricks of the trade buy a surplus field manual (FM), Watch Discovery Channel, or Join the Military or some Government agency. Billy Powell was a very misinformed hippie. The part that gave it all away was the part about the M-1 Garand. "Used in both World Wars and Korea" WW2 and Korea yes, WW1 no. I think its luck of some higher power that this dummy didn't hurt himself in the process. 
 This book only gives the absolute bare minimum of training guidelines.  It will give you a decent idea of what exercises to do, and a tiny bit of the reasons why to do them, but that is all.  The authors suggest doing some very simple exercises like the bench press, for which they show photos.  For the very complex, and somewhat dangerous, plyometric and power development exercises, they give almost no detail on how to do the exercise.  Why would they show photos of simple exercises that everyone knows how to do, and then just skim over the complex ones that they suggest are the most important exercises? 
 the author tries to secondguess the main criticism I have of this book not functioning as advertised by opening one chapter with something like "I don't know if it's obvious, but this is allegedly supposed to be a self-help book", and she goes on to say something about how the "self" in "self-help" means that you have to be the one to do the work. in that case, why waste anyone's time spending most of a book repeating several main details of her life and how messed up it is, adding a little more random detail each time she makes an equally random jump back or forth in the chronology?  her crappy writing brings to mind a good writer--john donne. when my high school literature teacher had us study donne's "a valediction: forbidding mourning", she drew attention to the opening image, good men dying in their beds. this Donne compared to the lovers parting as a way of telling the subject that she and the speaker shouldn't make a big show of their grief, even though grief is exactly the reaction the picture he paints would ordinarily evoke. the teacher pointed out that surely only donne, the consumate alchemist, could create love poetry from such unpromising material. the point being that although a creative person like Mike Myers based a character on the author of "i'd rather laugh", doesn't guarantee that she herself is compelling.   hollywood didn't think so. one of the chapters--and to the author's credit, it was the only one which really focussed on the mike myers connection--described the taping of a pilot for a talkshow hosted by the "real" linda richman and ends with her crying and moaning about how she refuses to continue with the show till myers comforts her by saying "don't worry, they hated you."   the inclusion of details such as this--which show richman as vulnerable and flawed--are endearingly honest, I suppose, if she had any redeeming qualities to make her sympathetic. but the main problem I had was that it was presented as a self-help book. if you forget that expectation, and read it as an autobigrophy, it's slightly better, but she's still not sympathetic.  as a child, she punched her mother after reporting her aunt's (her mother's sister's) death. and Linda seems still not to have forgiven her mum for concealing the fact of her dad's death. but it's not always clear if the mother deserves as bad a wrap as she gets, especially since linda's sister doesn't have the same issues.  Linda's issues are many. She had agoraphobia for eleven years (I bought the book primarily to learn how she fixed it) which she blames--wait for it--on her mother. but when she finally finds out what her agoraphobia is through an article in a magazine about a hospital that treats it and participates in group therapy as part of that treatment, she speaks of all the other patients as "jerks and losers compared to me". she has issues about handling her personal finances herself. she has phobias about her teeth, even though her dentist has told her he doesn't actually do much of anything when she comes to see him cos it's all in her head.   at least she's upfront about not being a great role model, but I still think some of her suggestions are flat-out irresponsible. for instance, her idea about a "pity party" in which one deals with depression by spending two days staying in bed, not bathing and watching the saddest movies one can find. this in a book where watching movies containing negativity and sadness is elsewhere equated with swallowing poison.   she says for the majority of her eleven years inside she read a book a day, which makes her better-read than I, but you'd think through all that reading she would've absorbed something about structure 
 Although New Order was uneven even before this one (Brotherhood is full of mediocre filler, and Low-Life has some bad stuff), the consistent quality of Technique created high expectations for the next record.  This record didn't have even one song that I cared for, and I gave the CD away. New Order's best records, in my estimation are: Power Corruption and Lies, Movement, and Technique. All three are very different, but consistently great throughout 
 I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out 
 My husband LOVES to cook and try different recipes.  I bought him this book but he didn't care for it because it has no pictures and he likes to see what the dish is supposed to look like or even to decide whether he wants to try it or not by seeing the picture.  This books gives a lot of Greek culture, he says, but he wasn't interested in that 
 Im a huge Stone Cold fan and I have got to say that I am horribly dissapointed. This disc does not contain any of the good Stone Cold matches...specificlly the matches during the Austin/Mcmahon/Corporate Ministry era.   Luckally, I rented this from Blockbuster. The main story is good but the rest I have seen in other DVDs. I was hoping for alot of matches. It would take atleast 4-6 DVD discs full of matches to really go deep into Austin's history. But 1 disc is pathetic. I put shame on the WWE as they have no idea what fans want.   This DVD was not even worth the rent. I am a horribly horribly dissapointed Stone Cold fan and wonder how the WWE could put out trash such as this.   I hope the WWE releases a 3-6 DVD set on Stone Cold otherwise I hope the WWE goes out of business as they are a horrible wrestling company now a days ever since they lost competion (WCW and ECW) and have no motivation to become better 
 if it is one thing i hate in a book it's a gimmick. gimmick writing is almost never clever or interesting or good, it is simply a gimmick. the gimmick here is that mr amis writes the novel backwards. the story, all dialogue, everything is backward. end to beginning, this, like all gimmicks, gets real tiresome, real fast. years ago i read mr amis's book "money," which i loved. i have been looking forward to reading more of him, so this came as a great disappointment. don't waste your time 
 I don't know why I do it to myself anymore.  Goodkind brought a real gem into the world of fantasy novels when he wrote Wizard's First Rule.  Unfortunately, as with most novel series I have read, it was all downhill from there.  The most common complaint in the reviews I have read seems to be that Goodkind's novels have become thinly-veiled philosophy essays, and I concur with that.  I'd also add that the story is predictable, the characters behave foolishly, and (how can I put this in a way that won't spoil the ending?) things just seem to work out a little too conveniently.  After this one, I don't think I'll continue to torture myself with any more of Goodkind's work.  I no longer care what happens to Richard and Kahlan, and as much as I liked them in the first book, that's pretty depressing 
 I appreciate what the guy is trying to do, it's just that he's not that funny. I don't have a lot of in depth criticism - his humor is just kind of dorky and average. He's very likeable, however. Like one of his jokes is:  "What if horses could talk, but all they said was just stupid, like 'I can hear the radio!' and you'd be like, 'you're magic for this?! what a waste!"  You'll probably finish listening to this CD with a feeling of ambivalence towards him. 
 I was disappointed upon receiving this CD.  I was expecting the one that is specifically with Tangerine Dream.  When I realized & looked that one up, it is OUTRAGEOUSLEY priced!!!  WHY???  Tangerine Dream isn't anymore popular than alot of other music, if not that popular or well known at all!!  I can get Pink Floyd CD's, Enigma, or One AD at reasonable prices...Is there any other resource I can look at to purchase the CD..Legend with Tangerine Dream??  Thanx for your time & listening..  Sherry 
 The hypothesis is pretty basic and the book takes a long time to get around to it. Not worth the read. He could have summarized all the good thinking in this book into a fairly short magazine article. In fact, let me summarize it for you and save the time. Evolution doesn't inherently lead to more complex organisms (like humans), scientists just focus on those organisms at the expense of simple ones (like bacteria). There, now you can read something else instead 
 This book is a collection of American Rhymes and Jingles from all the ages.  It was written 1966, but many of the ryhmes in it are still around today.  Some examples are How Much Wood Could a Woodchuck Chuck, Mary had a Little Lamb, This Little Pig, and Star Light Star Bright.  This book is very well illustrated, compared to other books of this time period 
 Lipton seems reluctant to deal with the facts she can recover. Instead, she prefers to create a fiction which is more of a projection of her own neurosis than anything which is supported by her sources. All the primary sources agree that Victorine Meurent was a destitute alcoholic for some time before she dies, but Lipton prefers to imagine her as a proto-feminist heroine. She seems so blinded by her own prejudice that she can only lash out at anyone who presents her with information which paints Victorine in less than favorable colors. For a more balanced view of the same material, find a copy of Otto Freiderich's Olympia: Manet and the Paris of his Times 
 I bought this book becuase I read Lets Get Real or Lets Not Play by Mahan Khalsa and was very intruiged by it.  Lets Get Real is a TERRIFIC book.  Little did I know that BusinessThink is basicly the coles notes version of Lets Get Real with two other names plunked above his.  There is little additional value added here.  If you want to get the same material but more of it and better presented, buy Lets Get Real 
 LOL! Some people cant be serious these days. The lyrics on every track are straight garbage. So he failed BAD lyric wise. Production wise, some of the beats are pretty good, but a beat doesnt make a song good! Nor does it make horrible lyrics good!! So I think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try J-Kwon, but the game aint for you. I think this album is garbage 
 the monitor looks really cool on the hand while cycling or at the gym... however due to its design, it does not provide accurate readings. the finger has to be in a specific position with the sensor and that too without movement if it has to be anywhere close to accurate. I'm going to stick with the chest strap for accurate readings 
 Originally placed the order for the non-Thinpak release as Amazon had listings for both the original-style 5-discs box set and the "new" slimline Thinpak.  Seems MGM decided not to release this box set in the original style; annoying to say the least.  They've previously released seasons 1 through 8 in the old-style.  SG-1 is now a cancelled series -- so what's the harm with releasing the same style for the last two releases (Season 9 & 10)??  This is not unlike the Simpson's box sets which were changed in season 5 to "head shots" of Simpsons characters.  After much protest, their distributor came out with original box set-style releases.  Smaller package... less inserts... looks puny on the DVD rack next to the other EIGHT seasons... same price.  Gotta love that marketing plan!  I'm returning mine and waiting on the hopes MGM will come to some sense and release the final two seasons old-school 
 The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the book!"  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.    A few laughs are provided.  A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved.  Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clichï¿½.  The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the  brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot.    Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room.  Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug.  I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director.  Enough said there.  My advice, watch `Get Shorty'again, or read `Be Cool.' 
 I purchased a copy of Foundation's Fear, eagerly looking forward to reading more into the Foundation universe. Though I expected it to be different from Asimov's books to a certain degree, as this was inevitable, I didn't expect this.  I have to agree with many of the other reviewers when I say that this book just doesn't fit into the Foundation universe. Benford does state in the back of the book that he isn't trying to write a mock-Asimov, but a Benford Foundation novel, and is not attempting to write in Asimov's style. This is fine with me... to a point.   Not only did he write in a completely different style, he changed the very nature of the characters (not to mention the spelling of  Dors' last name, at least in printing that I own...). Since this book is supposed to take place in between two novels already written by Asimov, this change in the characters is not fitting. Characters suddenly use a completely new vocabulary, and "speak" in an entirely different fashion. Ideas and technologies are presented as so commonplace, and even integral in this novel that were not present in Asimov's novels that surrounded the time period in the series. Asimov himself did this between books, where periods of time allow for technological change, but it doesn't work in the fashion that Benford inserts it into a period of time already described by Asimov.  On top of this character change, the very plot of the novel is really quite pointless. It delves into subplots that are rather absurd for the Foundation universe, made worse in that they serve no real purpose. To those of you who have not read it, I will tell you only that Joan of Arc and Voltaire make presenses in this book, and large portions of it, at that. It simply doesn't feel Foundation-esque, and doesn't provide any material that makes the Foundation puzzle feel more complete, despite it's events occuring in the Foundation universe.  If you can stand not reading every book with the word "Foundation" in the title, skip this one. Find a summary, and move on to Foundation & Chaos, which is much better and more in tune to the Foundation universe. You won't miss much 
 If you just married the bosses daughter and got a position you didn't work for. Then obtained your first passport to go negotiate some multi million dollor deal on your first trip to a foreign country then you may get through this book. As an independent businessman with multicultural dealing worldwide it took about 2 minutes to realize I wasted my money on this one.   Learn a bit of Chineas Business Ettiquite, be nice to people and save your money for Dim Sum 
 I found this book to be very ponderous reading with the descriptions going on and on.  Characters did not become very real.  The actions of Charles do not seem believable.  I read this book because it was one that my book club had read before I joined.  While I did not enjoy the book I think I would have been very interested in the book club's discussion of this book 
 I was at the library, wondering if rabbits made good pets, and I picked up this book. It was right beside dog training books, books about cats, etc. But, unfortunately, as I found out when I got home, this book is about raising rabbits to sell for meat. The last chapter is horrific- after going into detail about how to raise these beautiful creatures, the author goes about telling the reader how to destroy it, and which spices taste nice on its skin. No thanks. I just want a Mopsy 
 What a disappointment!  NO extras! NO Widescreen! NO remastering! NOTHING!!!  Shame and blame to those who released this DVD in such a careless way.   Fans of this film, you've been warned!   
 I enjoyed "Temple" but this book was just awful.  Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes.  You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time.  In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure.  1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him.    and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear.  Right.  The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.  Read "Temple" instead 
 This book is offensive and you can tweak and make up numbers all you want. African-Americans have a strong tradition of passing on oral history to their children. We know the truth and our truth does not have to be  validated by anyone. Further, de facto slavery continued well after the  civil war through the use of Jim Crow, where black women were still forced  to work like slaves and were sexually exploited. We know this because our  grandmothers told us stories about being maids and nurses for white folks.  We have an up close and personal view of white folks and your revisionist  theories are not going to wipe these memories away. If you want evidence of  exploitation, just look at our skin color. We didn't get so many mulattos  and quadroons through artificial insemination. A lot of "white  folks" are mixed and they don't even know it. The ignorance in this  country is simply astounding. One can only hope that this ignorance is not  passed on to young children. I would assume that this author also believes  that that the holocaust didn't exist; the jewish survivors are just making  up a bunch of stuff. I guess being in a gas chamber and providing slave  labor was good for Germany's economy, so hey that makes it o.k., right 
 What a disappointment this book is. For one is very poorly written. Blair Jackson is simply too much of a fanboy and too little of a writer with this particular book. Its presents itself as a biography of Garcia and far too many times it drifts off into a simplistic Deadhead's review of Garcias various tunes. Way too many pretentious references to Hunters lyrics and really his put downs on Weir and other members (thinly veiled but non the less put downs) reek of Garcia worship. He finds no faults in any Garcia tunes and plays up his ballads (which were often low points of Dead shows) like they were the shimmering representation of all that is the Grateful Dead.  He also glosses over many aspects of Garcias personal life, which is silly for a biography. There are more reviews of Hunter and Garcia tunes then there are facts presented about the man the book is about. If its something that can be said without bringing up anything critical then Jackson carries on about it, but if its a low point then he will place a sentence or at most a paragraph. Garcia is a complex man and his biography should have been more complex. I dont want to read another book chiming in with English 101 poetry reviews, I wanted to read a book that chronicled Garcias life in an unobstructed manner. Jackson turned out to be way too much of a fanboy of Garcia to make an effective book. 
 When you have lost weight, it's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off. Whenever they have heard me tell my story, read my blog or book, or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle, one question invariably has come up from time to time:   "What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?"  My initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this:  "That's absolutely crazy! There's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method."  I did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there. But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.  Little did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about. It's called The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller.  The CAD diet, as it is referred to, makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance. Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less, that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.  If people think the Atkins diet is restrictive, then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet:  BREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat. LUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.  You are NOT allowed to eat any bread, fruit, milk, juice, and most starchy vegetables. Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda. You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.  Sound appealing, anyone? Hmmm? I suppose if that's all there was to this diet, then NOBODY would do it. But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in.   DINNER: Eat equal amounts of protein, vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount, but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame. You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your "reward" meal.  How's that for incentive? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line! Who wouldn't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT?!  Well, I'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a DAILY basis. I caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial "planned splurge" meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss. However, the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge!!! What's up with that?  We can blame this on Dr. Rachael, who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet. She became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat (ostensibly to help herself in the process, too). She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then, like most of us would, ate to her heart's content whatever she wanted for supper. The next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds.  Thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale, she tried it again the next day, skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again, she lost another pound. She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day.  The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet. The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether. They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict. It will make them crave their poison even more!  That's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day. This process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one, and the Hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people.  I still can't get around the fact that you don't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds. Sure, they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day, but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER!  There's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion. I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off. Since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the CAD diet, it would literally drive me insane even if there was that "reward" meal at the end of the day!  Wanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict? Click here to take the 10-question Carbohydrate Addict's Test. I scored a 2, which means "You do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted." No kidding, ya think?  Dr. Jonny Bowden, author of Living The Low-Carb Life, examined the CAD diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works.  "While it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese, it's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin, as the Hellers hypothesize--in fact, the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response."  Furthermore, Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program, stating "it's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate."  While The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off, I still have my reservations about this program. I think I'll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day 
 the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face. However, the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it. It hasnt torn completely...yet. Nevertheless, I would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon. I wouldnt suggest this produc 
 Actually, This CD consists of 6 fine Irish instrumental pieces and 9 average pop recordings which are not at all complementary.  The title track's chorus, for instance, is repeated 17 times in just over 4 minutes & many other of the Corrs' own compositions included herein are equally inane and repetitive; so much so that I'm inclined to think that the Irish instrumentals subtrack from this album more than they add to it.  The pop songs could then just be accepted as conventional popular music then & we wouldn't be exposed to the disconnect that is apparent when we have the Irish instrumentals to compare to it.  Consequently, this CD feels like an album of the Chieftains randomly mixed up with something from the likes of Belinda Carlisle, Debbie Gibson, Shania Twain, or Brittany Spears.  If you are a popular musc fan, take your pick elsewhere & if you are looking for Irish music try sampling something from Sinead O'Conner (perhaps the CD, Sean-Nos Nua), anything from Enya, and/or something from Clannad.  Cheers 
 having heard of a prequel for jackson's film(a different interpretation from merrian cooper's version) i was convinced that the author would have ample opportunity to write a new adventure story with familiar concepts, possibly rich enough in detail and excitement to stand on it's own. seeing the great respect jackson's team had for the original, my expectations seemed logical at the time. what i found was pointless elaborations about life in 1932 new york, stretched for more than a third of the book, the tribulations of carl denham and jack driscoll equally stretched and the action and history of skull island reduced to an afterthought. i was disappointed with kong not making an apperance(we all know who he is, so if, as a previous reviewr has mentioned, the author was restricted in scope by the studios, such a decision is evidently a negative factor) as well as not developing the potential of the paleontologist that discovered skull island but was supressed by the authorities, and so on.  for a truely wonderful prequel read kong: king of skull island by joe devito and brad strickland 
 If anyone has ever done any research into the fields of congnitive psychology or memory, you'll realize how incredibly awful this book is.   "If you are unable to remember any specific instances [of abuse] like the ones mentioned above but still have a feeling that something abusive happened to you, it probably did." Page 21. How awful is that? Completely misleading as well. Any memory such as this can be implanted into someone's mind, when they had NO actual abuse in their lives.  Furthermore, "If you think you were abused and your life shows the symptoms, then you were." Page 22. Need I say more? This is utter trash. Completely unbased by scientific findings or even common sense.  Avoid this book at all costs if you are a serious victim of child abuse. Realize that it is very easy, as humans, to recall past instances of violence, trauma, and abuse, when they actually NEVER happened.   It's sad and morally disturbing to see a book such as this in print. It's even more disturbing that people are accepting this book as a true "self-help" book. I encourage ANYONE thinking about buying this to reconsider and do a lot more research into their past before conjuring up false recall of past memories 
 I had just finished Saving Grace, which I really liked, so I picked up Heartbreaker and was very disappointed. I didn't really care about the characters, and found the book boring. 
 Let's face it, I have a million things I'd rather spend my precious time doing that reading a book about a cute and lovable newlywed who has gotten into a horrible accident and suffered amnesia... only to remember halfway through the book that her darling husband is dead.  How rotten is that? Even a dose of "Ghost-esque" contact with the dearly departed loved one who assures her she will love again was not enough to restore my faith in humanity and Marian Keyes. As the English would say, "What is she playing at? 
 ...the student confessed that he had made it up after being confronted by the professor who had repeated the story to a Standard-Times reporter.  The professor, Brian Glyn Williams, said he went to his former student's house and asked about inconsistencies in his story. The 22-year-old student admitted it was a hoax, Williams said.

 here's an example of a toy with a great idea but poor product.  My son received this car for his first birthday.  He likes it and by 16 months learned to push the button to make it go.  But after 4 months of light use it stopped rolling.  New batterys don't help.  It sounds like it's working but won't roll.  Dad is taking it apart to try to fix it but we shouldn't have to resort to that in just 4 months.  Aside from that, a major downside is that there is no automatic shutdown.  If your toddler loses interest in the toy after a few minutes (they all do), the car continues to make noise until someone gets up to shut it down (draining the battery).  Seems like a small thing but it gets annoying.  For the price, it may be acceptable to some.  Aside from its problems it's perfect for toddlers.  There is just one button to push to make it go; push it once and it goes in forward; push it again and it turns to the left; push it again it goes forward again.  So it's not something you can truly "steer" or anything but it does give a toddler a sense of control.  If they could add a auto shutdown feature and improve the reliability it could be a great little toy 
 This book is okay. It never really immerses you in the world--instead you just sort of skim along the top of it, half-caring about what happens next. Everyone feels like a stock characters: the "bad guys" are bumbling idiots, and the good guys (even Peter) are self-sacrificing and far-seeing. We barely even see the task force which calls itself the Starcatchers, and the book really could have survived without them. Tinkerbell doesn't show up till the last page or so (I spent most of the book wishing for the fairy to come breathe some complexity and life into the cast), and the croc never eats the clock.  As an avid Dave Barry fan, I could literally pick out which lines had been written by him. Not to say that the book was funny (because, unfortunately, it was not)--his style just flashes off the page in neon colors.  A few innuendoes will raise eyebrows--they really shouldn't have been in a book so geared toward children.  There are better books out there. Buy them instead 
 This light worked for me when I used two D-batteries, but that was a lucky guess as the light did not come with instructions. I was also unaware that the light was fender mount, and wasn't happy about the idea of drilling a hole in my fender just for the light. I found that replacing the front  reflector with the light worked OK for me, and this replacement was easy on the cruiser I have. My main complaint for this product is the lack of description on the internet, and the missing installation instructions 
 I find myself rehashing my own reviews at this point but nonetheless, I aspire to write a review on each instalment.  Producers have tested logistics to new levels by taking Jason on a murderous vacation to New York.  The film begins on Camp Crystal, where two teenage lovers are discussing the legend of Jason.  Whilst they speak of him, Jason is electrocuted (again) back to life by the contact of the boat's anchor.  More conveniently, he finds a hockey mask on the boat to cover up his unsightly face.  Cue two dead teens with very bad gory effects and Jason's off on his way to New York.  Cue once again a series of brutal murders on the boat, with female heroine Jensen Dagett avoiding him at all costs until he reaches New York shores.  As a side story, the heroine has had previous contact with Jason when she is swimming in the water so she is frightened of the water as a result.  At this stage, a change of scenery was needed but it doesn't work well at all.  What's so scary in New York?  Comedy is used to no effect in this movie and again the death scenes are more elaborate.  Can this unlucky lady stop Jason in his tracks one more time? Will this beast ever die? I rest my case 
 This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal 
 While well produced, I was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings.  Frankie Laine still sounds great - but it just wasn't the same.  I bought the CD to replace a well worn vinyl album, but on listening to the CD I found the songs to all be slightly (and in a couple of cases very), different in tempo and vocal inflection - it's definitely not the album I've loved for over 30 years!  High Noon in particular is quite different, much slower, with vocal emphasis changed.  I'll probably listen to the CD from time to time, but not with the same relish that I enjoyed my old LP 
 It's a very depressing moment when one of your musical heroes turns in a poor album, but if I'm honest with myself I'd have to admit that it is only inertia that has kept me buying his increasingly lacklustre efforts over the past three or so years. 'Normal Happiness' is the first Pollard release where after multiple listens I haven't connected with a single song, nor found an infectious melody the like of which were previously sprinkled liberally throughout his oeuvre. The problems are threefold: the production is uniform  and flat, lacking in warmth; gone are the walls of rock guitar and reverb-soaked vocals of old, replaced by a kind of clinical blandness perhaps the result of this being practically a one man effort (Todd Tobias) in terms of instrumentation rather than a real band. Then there is Pollard's voice, which is at times just plain awful - off-key or with increasingly bizarre deliveries that just don't come off. Finally, the songs themselves: as well as the lack of any 'instant hits', the riffs seem to me to be uninspired. The lyrics too, are bland, and lacking in Pollard's former ability to make stream of consciousness word play into poignant and evocative verbal pictures. He sounds bored. Perhaps he has just had enough of writing infectious melodies and, Picsasso-like, is trying to deconstruct his songs to find new forms of musical expression. On the 1997 Guided by Voices album 'Mag Earwhig' there was a track entitled 'Sad if I Lost It' - I'm sorry to say that I think he has 
 Elizabeth's stories are more offensive than scary. I'd be scared one in particular may give those prone to animal abuse  a gory idea..maybe it's just me...it seems that short stories don't allow for a complicated plot, or in-depth character development.I can think of other horror writers short stories that "..grab you by the throat" more 
 I wasn't sure what I'd get but it turns out to be basicly an overpriced noteboo 
 Not an easy read, kind of slow.  There is some good advice that we already know, but just don't utilize.  I still haven'r finished reading 
 The problem with the EMH guys is that have never run there own money!  They have a "belief system" that gives them comfort...it's ok to accept average performance.  I will agree that large mutual funds are fighting an uphill battle and that most "common folk" aren't interested or even psychologically able to run their own money.  There are however individuals that are looking at the right set of factors and they follow their own advice rather than their brokers. The individual investor has an incredible advantage over the mutual fund.  I have personally averaged  around 33% for the last 18 years.  There are clearly factors to screen for that put the odds in your favor when selecting stocks.  I won't get into exactly what factors I use but I'll say I'm in the Greenblatt, Lynch camp as opposed to the O'neil GAP types. The individual has the ability to be rational when others are not.  Countless individuals are beating the market year after year.  There are and always will be inefficienies in the market.  Smaller companies that aren't well followed and thinly traded give the individual unbelievable opportunities.  I would highly recommend both of Joel Greenblatts books,and any books on behavioral finance(Richard Thaler, Hersh Shefrin and many others).  I suppose that the "average person" would be better off in an index fund but it is incredibly offensive to suggest that people can't beat the market over a long period....they are doing it all the time.  The AAII guys(shadow stock) have done 20% for the last 10 years.  Motley Fool has done well.  There are different approaches, some resulting in higher turnover than others.  I tend to side with the small value camp(I'm really more GARP'y), but I know growth guys that compound at high rates year after year.... it is very doable 
 I was extremely excited when I discovered this book.  I wanted it for my ten-year-old-daughter.  From reading other reviews, the book was suppose to be about girls becoming wowen (getting their periods).  I was disappointed to find that the book contained too much information about sex and a picture of male genitals.  I wanted my daughter to learn about her own genitals--not a male's genitals.    The book does cover a lot of what girls need to know about getting their periods.  If you are not concerned about your young daughter learning about sex--get the book, but if you wanted information only about menstruation, this is not the book for you 
 I thought the book was appropriate for a young adult. I ended up giving it to my neighbors three year old son because it was more of a toddlers picture book. I felt the book was misrepresented online. 
 I saw this book when I was a child and wanted to read it then (it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp/airship on it).  Unfortunatley, life intervened and I only got around to reading it just recently.  Alas!  This book was a lot better and more wonder-filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be.  The story is not very interesting, the setting is not well-painted, the protagonist's adventures are pedestrian, and the whole thing is swiss-cheesed with so much British slang as will likely put an American kid off his feed.  Skip this one 
 This cd sounds like a bunch of 8-year-olds screaming. I like most of the original songs, but they are sung increadible badly by young kids. Most of these songs are meant to be sung by only one person, but the "Kidz Bop Kids" have about 10 people singing them at once. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! I'd give this 0 stars if I could, but there isn't an option for that 
 This wasn't a novel. It was a blueprint. And might as well be considered a history book now. 
 This entire album is melodically and lyrically boring.  Metaphors  are poorly executed and content just boring.  I will never listen to it again 
 the premise of this book suggested that there might be some interesting ideas in there. what a disappointment-there are none. the book is basically a brochure for the authors movement(?)of manifestlove (as he calls it). it all reads a bit new-age, and very american...with little idea or appreciation of a whole other gay world out there beyond the u.s.a.  what makes the book ultimately pointless is that nimmons has no new ideas - he spends the best part of the book outlining what is wrong (or underappreciated) with gay men and their lives (all seen through rose-tinted glasses...especially the chapter on gay men-straight women friends...yuck!!!!!!), and then trots out some of his manifestlove ideas at the end. and consumers...since you are now hooked, you are supposed to sign up for one of his courses/camps or whatever. it is a very cynical approach to write a book to promote your own industry...and as such should be avoided! spend your money elsewhere! or better...just go for a walk on a beach at sunset and enjoy the view and the sounds of the waves...it will do you a lot more good...and make you feel way better than this book!! 
 This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.    I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can't believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"   
 + Creme Filling  + I suppose they taste alright if you can prevent them from falling apart all over the floor.  - You cannot prevent them from falling apart all over the floor.  - They are unbelievably dry 
 maybe it's because he is such a stright shooter(pun ment) or something but clint doesn't do cold war thrillers very well(remember firefox). while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they don't cover up the fact that it was a good book that doesn't watch as good as it read.some may like it but i found it to be a let down 
 If you know nothing at all about Steven Spielberg, this book might be a good summary of his career. But if you are looking for personal insights, new depth or detailed film analysis, invest your book-buying money  elsewhere. I was also put off by the fairly frequent denigrating remarks  about various actors, screen writers and directors many of whom have  careers that would seem worthy of some degree of respect 
 Certainly not as interesting as I expected it to be. Boring and no "inside" insight into "the boys".  Not recommended 
 By this time Piers Anthony is losing the magic that made him so refreshing a read in the first place. There's hardly anything new and even the puns are getting dull. I think its time he moved on to other works. If he doesn't, then his readers will 
 Mr. Lozowick, along with all the hundreds (if not thousands) of other pundits, pols, propagandists, spinmeisters, and other assorted demagogues, can slice his particular form of baloney as thick or as thin as he wants, but after all the countless millions of words on the topic of modern Israel and Zionism have been poured forth, three simple facts remain:  1. The original Zionist Jews came from (mostly) Europe to Palestine with the stated aim of dispossessing the people who were already living there and establishing a Jewish state on the land.  2. The people who were already there refused to quietly go away and let the Zionist Jews have what they wanted without a fight.  3. The British, French and Americans have all been heavily complicit in furthering the aims of the Zionist Jews. For almost a century, major Western nations have helped to sell the Palestinian Arabs down the river - and we still expect the Arabs to LOVE us for doing it!  All else is mere commentary and window dressing.  Mr. Lozowick fails to convince me that Israel has any more right to exist than does any other artificially constructed modern nation such as Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia or Taiwan. And two of these three are already gone from the Atlas in the forms in which they were created.  Just as I refuse to shed any tears over the Spanish Conquistadores or American settlers who came to the New World to dispossess and oppress the natives and who got themselves seriously dead for their temerity, so, too, do I refuse to shed any tears over any of the Zionist Jews who have become defunct while squatting on lands they have wrested from others by force and/or legalistic mumbo-jumbo.  And I equally refuse to demonize the Palestinians for fighting the foreign invaders with whatever means they have at their disposal. Wars for home and hearth are never pretty things.  There is NO moral high ground to be found under either side in this conflict 
 So I still need to see the 2nd one again after not seeing it for many many years, but here is my review for this dvd.     Kickboxer 3 - These types of movie are SO difficult to watch. The characters are all acting ok, but the storyline is on par with any linear story that has ever been done. I wish that I could give this a good review cause I like cody from step by step, and he can't do anything great in terms of high quick legs or really fast fist forms, but he does make up a little but for that in his power. Though the action director doesn't showcase it, you can tell that cody has plenty of power. I would love to give you some long review and give you the whole storyline but , you know what, I guess I can, Cody is going to a tournament, a guy doesn't want him to fight in it so his guy can win, so this guy acts nice at first and then when cody won't accept an invitation to throw a fight for money, he gets mean and since he is also like a slave trader he decides to put cody through some hell training with 1 enjoyable moment out of like 8 scenes.   Alright so i reviewed the story only because it is no goddang simple.   Overall this movie is not suggested by me and you should only watch it if you have seen every good kungfu movie, and I haven't even come close, so this sucked.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  Kickboxer 4 - Now this movie actually had the potential to be good unlike the last one. You get the impression that they are actually going to have a tournament in this one and they almost give you double digits in fights.   Since this was almost watchable, I will go over the strong points:   -Hot girl who can fight, always a good thing.  -Cody getting to show off a little bit and he actually looks decent in this one.  -Having a tournament and actually showing some fights, none that are good, but some that I would give a 2/5.  -Even hotter girl-this one even gets down.   Horrible things about this movie:   -Guy who looks like the abd guy from original kickboxer is really hard to look at. If you are gonna get a look-a-like, at least get a fighter, and maybe he can fight, but if he can, let him. So something was very wrong there, and almost as bad as that was his make up. They used a very tan person so when he took off his shirt, his face looked white in comparison to his golden skin. Very hard to watch.  -Guy who is a b movie actor and can fight, but acting ability can be rivaled by any male soap opera star.  -Bad guy doesn't notice cody is in the tournament until the end.  -This aspect of the movie is so bad that it is funny. Every time cody would fight, something would distract him from seeing cody's face like his girl being kissed, truly funny stuff.   So final fight ranks #384,225th on my all-time list, pretty good. 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 What a shame this DVD transfer is so aweful, because the movie is great. I have seen this movie before on SBS TV (Australia) and have been wanting a copy since. But this DVD looks like a transfer from an already poor quality VHS copy. Very disappointed 
 This is by far the worst business book I have read in recent years.  It is hard to believe that Andy Grove actually thought that this material was worth putting into a book.  As other reviews have said, this book at most should have been a short article in Business Week...but even then it would require some actual content to make it worth reading.  The best part of the book is the quotes on the cover from Steve Jobs et al.  It makes me wonder if they even read the book 
 I purchased this book thinking that it would be interesting and humorous as I start my new career as a stay-at-home mom, however, I am returning it.  The humor really stereotypes stay at home moms.  I read a couple of chapters and just couldn't take anymore of it.  It was actually disturbing.  To me, it wasn't worth the money.  If you're looking for a book that will guide you through your transition from career to SAHM, this will not be the right book 
 Maybe it's just me and I'm expecting so much when I spend my money or a little bit of time listenin' to these new n*ggas. But I'm just not feelin' this s*it here. I fell asleep mid way through this album. I just can't seem to understand why these n*ggas is so one dimesional. I cant underdstand why people still supportin' these n*ggas. Not one track was tolerable. If dis cd belonged to me i would threw this s*it away already. Word of advice dont buy this. 
 'Chess Artist' is a mixed bag. Hallman tries to provide a history of chess, a character study of his friend Glen, and a travelogue to Chess City in Kalmykia. The result is a novel with a schizophrenic, disjointed tone that often leaps clunkily from one topic to another.  The author's writing style ranges from readable to grating. I'm of the school that believes good writing should seem effortless, and you can just feel the strain in some of the descriptions: "The buildings were all of the same black brick, an architectual surrender that would have made sense if it had been a moon colony" (Pg. 3) Occasional lapses into the passive voice, as well as other sloppy mistakes, make it difficult at times to tell who is doing what.  The author's persona isn't entirely likeable, either. In recounting a chess game against a co-worker, Hallman writes: "Even though I did not play chess very well, I could discern things about the pit boss from how he played. He was aggressive and stubborn. He appreciated creativity but prefered the thrill of winning. The scolding he gave himself when he erred suggested self-esteem problems, and the casualness with which he eventually resigned suggested he was also resigned to his life." (Pg. 27)  Apparently Hallman (a self-appointed "chess historian") missed his true calling as a private investigator or a therapist; gaining so much insight into a person's life during a quick game of chess is a rare talent indeed. Passages like this one frequently left me with the impression that Hallman is very assured of his own cleverness.  However, this is not to say the book is entirely without merit. It can be interesting at times, especially if you don't know much about the history of chess. And the book does a decent job of portraying how chess completely consumes some people's lives. Consider glancing it over at a local library if you're interested in chess, but definitely don't buy it sight-unseen 
 After feverishly finishing Shadowmancer, I instantly went out and bought this novel. Boy, what a disappointment! This book is so lame. Lamer than Attack of the Clones and ewoks combined- and, from me, that is a HUGE insult. It was so bad I hardly forced myself to finish it. I loved Shadowmancer because it so vibarantly expressed Biblical truth in a way that unbelieving readers- Harry Potter exuberants, especially- might not exactly realize what they were reading, but would still get some basic and beautiful truths about Christ into their heads. That was all erased from this novel. NOTHING! Nothing whatsoever. I could almost say that the Buddhist and New Age-swamped Star Wars saga is more spiritually inline than this novel. What happened to good theology? What happened to the grace of Christ? What happened to His love? His protection? How He crushes evil under His heel? What happened to Deutoronomy's harsh veiw on magic that causes me to avoid Harry Potter?   And besides that, it was just not well written at all. Just as bad as Eragon, and GP Taylor is HOW much older than Christopher Paolini?! Tolkien probably wrote this bad when he was FIVE!   Terrible book. Stay away.  But does anybody want my copy? 
 I also could not get past the first 40 pages.  There really isn't much of a plot.  Boring... 
 I am from Australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to Amazon. Is a complete season of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing? I don't think so.  Not only have the distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the real original Season 1, when we know it is not.  The release in the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal.  AARO 
 Oleanna is about a twisted, vicious young woman's need to bring a man (and by extention, all men) down. John, played by William Macy, is a college professor. Carol, played by Debra Eisenstadt, is one of his students. When Carol seeks help for a failing grade, John goes out of his way to help her personally, on a one to one basis. Carol is more than a little irritating and John becomes more than a little irritated by her seeming inability to grasp the simplist concepts. Playing the good professor, John faults his pedantic self for her failure to understand the material. Days later, John is caught off guard when Carol maliciously levels the charge of sexual harrasment against him - just in time to destroy his bid for tenure. Her earlier need for help has been a set up. Carol has been keeping notes all along - cataloging any word or action she might turn against him. Carol's campaign against John is facilitated by what she refers to as "the group." That is to say, by the usual nest of ideological feminists on campus in which Carol has "found herself" and a place for her sexual neuroses. She comes fully armed with her feminist groupthink about sexual harrassment and rape. Her arguments against John rest on rejecting the evidence of one's own senses in favor of a left wing vocabulary thick with words like "patriarchal," "hegemonic," "classism," and an obvious hatred of men. The director, David Mamet, tests the audiences patience as Carol apes the usual post-modern jardon that would put into question our everyday intersubjective (common sense) consensus about the meaning of our everyday words and actions -- especially the everyday words and actions of men. For Carol and "the group,'" reality is always trapped between parentheses because it is always determined by power and those who have it. Men had it in the past. She and her group have it now. Her "reality" takes precedence over John's. Carol eventually trumps her charge of sexual harrassment with a charge of rape and John, bless his heart, loses his inhibitions about hitting a woman. All in all, this movie held my attention, made me needlessly anxious, and pissed me off just enough to want to write my take on it.      
 Despite the cute illustrations this book is about crude, rude boars (or boors).  While an adult may (or may not) think this is sarcasm, for sure kids won't "get it!"  This is a lousy example to set before kids of any age.  The kids will love the poop pictures and farts and general bad behavior, but most parents (and especially grandparents) will be VERY put off by this book.  I wish I had my money back.  I did NOT give the book to the child it was bought for.  I threw it away instead 
 I haven't read many books written by Patterson but I liked The Notebook so I thought I would read some of his other publications.  I didn't find much to like about At First Sight.  The story is totally unbelievable and the characters one-dimensional. It is a boiler plate romance novel. The couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart. A wave of a wand and they both know they love each other. The happy couple then find and overcome adversity.   Patterson is not a bad writer. If you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read, you won't be disappointed.  If you want a realistic story and believeable characters, then At First Sight isn't for you 
 We've had a number of Gazillion bubble machines.  The first - this one, with an upright rotating set of bubble wands - worked relatively well, but stopped working after maybe a dozen uses.  (Granted, one of those uses was for a few hours).  When the level of liquid is low, the machine stops making bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand.    We replaced it the next year with the Typhoon machine - this was awesome, produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the wands, no matter how low the supply of liquid.  It has a large reservoir at the bottom so you don't need to fill it very often - it takes a lot of liquid though.    Our issue now is getting the liquid.  Gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles - they last well, etc. etc. etc.  HOWEVER, very few stores stock the liquid, and except for when I first bought the first machine, no-one stocks large size bottles.  Even the online vendors like toys.com who are supposed to have them, never have them in stock (I've been on their notify list for a long time!)  I've ended up buying from someone in Canada on eBay - otherwise, buying the smaller bottles at ToysRUs, Target, etc. is just too expensive.    Both of these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids (especially the cheaper kinds in very large size bottles) are much thinner and the liquid drips right off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part to make any bubbles.   We're planning to start making our own bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us.  Otherwise, the machines are useless now.  
 Don't waist your money or time on this.  This DVD set is just an over grown advertisment.  They used the mystic of the SEALs to push this, and is more of a case of false advertisment than anything else 
 Jan Tomasz Gross' book "Neighbors:  the Destruction of  the Jewish Community in Jedwabne" was first published in Poland in early 2000 (under the Polish title `Sasiedzi: Historia Zaglady Zydowskiego Miasteczka'), and appeared in 2001 in American (English-language) and German editions.  `Neighbors' describes how a massacre of a number believed to be 1,600 Jews on July 10, 1941, in the village of Jedwabne near Lomza in northeastern Poland, which had hitherto been generally believed to be carried out by the German military, was actually carried out with Polish participation - according to Gross' account, it was organized and carried out by Poles, with German acquiescence.  The accusation that Poles were responsible for the Jedwabne massacre had an enormous impact on Polish public opinion.  A Polish governmental commission, the Institute of National Memory (Instytut Pamieci Narodowej, IPN) was charged with conducting a detailed investigation. IPN's findings were detailed in a 1500 page, two-volume study entitled `Wokol Jedwabnego' which unfortunately is presently available only in Polish. IPN's findings were made public on July 9th, 2002.    Gross' account in `Neighbors' is now known to be true in part, and in part inaccurate.  The fly-leaf of the hardcover edition of `Neighbors' summarizes the story as follows: `One summer day in 1941, half of the Polish town of Jedwabne murdered the other half - 1,600 men, women and children - all but seven of the town's Jews.'  According to IPN's investigation, this statement is inaccurate.   (1)   "1,600 (Jewish) men, women and children" were murdered (this statement in Gross' `Neighbors' has been repeated many times).  In fact, Jedwabne in 1941 did not have 1,600 Jewish inhabitants. An IPN historian, Jan Jerzy Milewski, found a 1940 Soviet NKVD document in the archive in Grodno showing that in Jedwabne in 1940 there were about 560 Jews.  Thus a year before the massacre, a Soviet census found the Jewish population of Jedwabne to be approximately one-third the number given by Jan T. Gross in `Neighbors'.  IPN's exhumation of the Jedwabne victims was interrupted at the request of the invited supervising Jewish rabbi that the remains of the victims not be further disturbed.  The best estimate of IPN's chief forensic investigator, Prof. Andrzej Kola, was that there were between 300 and 400 victims.  IPN concluded: `The figure of 1,600 victims or so seems highly unlikely, and it was not confirmed in the course of the investigation.'  (2)  `The Germans' direct participation in the mass murder.....was limited, pretty much, to their taking pictures' (Gross, `Neighbors'). This is false. In reality, IPN found, the day began "with the herding of Poles to the town square, which was done, according to witnesses, jointly by the German gendarmes, i.e. policemen and the people from the collaborating administration. In the testimonials there is mention of the fact that German policemen hit some of the Jedwabne Poles in the face with rifle butts or their hands, which is evidence that some of them did not want to go to the town square." The Germans then distributed bats and clubs to the Poles, to use as weapons against the Jews.  At the Jedwabne town square, the Germans were in charge.  The Germans were not in Jedwabne just as photographers, as Gross would have readers believe.  The Germans were in Jedwabne as organizers.  (3) "Half of the Polish town" murdered the other half: This is not accurate.  IPN, after interviewing 98 persons of whom about one-third were first-hand witnesses, concluded that "approximately at least forty men" were Polish perpetrators in the murder (but not "one half of the town" as stated on the fly-leaf of `Neighbors', which would have required over one thousand participants; Gross himself, in `Neighbors,' claims to have ninety-two names of Polish participants). Whether ninety-two according to Gross or "at least forty" in IPN's findings, the number of Polish participants in the Jedwabne massacre was not one-half of the village, but closer to one-twentieth.  An ACCURATE English-language version of IPN's principal findings, about 3 pages long, can be found on the Internet by going to `The Jedwabne Tragedy' at Buffalo University's `info-Poland' website, and then to `Jedwabne, July 10th, 1941: an interview with Prof. Pawel Machcewicz.'  Gross' book "Neighbors' was spectacularly successful in provoking an intensive two-year debate in Poland on the subject of Polish-Jewish relations.  An excellent collection of papers from that debate, in English translation, has been published under the title `The Neighbors Respond' edited by Joanna Michlic and Professor Antony Polonsky of Brandeis University.  `The Neighbors Respond' is not a rebuttal to `Neighbors', but examines the subject from many viewpoints. Those who want to better understand the subject, including what anti-Semitism was, and was not, in Poland, will learn far more - and in far greater depth - from `The Neighbors Respond'  than from reading `Neighbors' alone.  The greatest shortcoming of `Neighbors' is its inadequate treatment of events leading up to the 1941 Jedwabne massacre.  Gross never tells readers of `Neighbors' the most important thing which happened during the 1939 - 1941 Russian occupation of eastern Poland: the four massive deportations, from February 1940 to June 1941 (see Jan T. Gross, `Revolution from Abroad,' 2002 edition, pages 194-222, 262).  These deportations were atrocities, with women and children "packed in a standing position in sealed, windowless, and unheated cattle-wagons, for a winter journey of three, four, five or even six thousand miles.......instances of derangement, frostbite, starvation, infanticide and even cannibalism occurred."   (Norman Davies, `God's Playground,' Vol. 2, pages 448-449).    In Jedwabne, the deportation round-ups in June 1941, only a few weeks before the massacre, are described by IPN: "(Soviet) NKVD agents in groups of three, accompanied by members of the local militia, came looking for families of persons arrested or persons who had gone into hiding.  Jewish militia volunteers escorted the deportees, so they - in the eyes of many local Poles - were to blame for everything."   Many Jews in eastern (not in central) Poland, collaborated with the Russian occupation.  In many places, Jews welcomed Russian invaders.  Jewish-Soviet collaboration embittered Polish-Jewish relations during World War II and its aftermath.

 This is the kind of garbage they teach you to write in college--imitations of what's on the shelf right now, only "smarter," which really just means "condescending to those not born with a silver spoon in ultrawhite Marin County." But you shouldn't be surprised--the authoress also writes a blog which is just as bloated with self-absorption (even if she wants to pretend this is a novel: novels have PLOTS, honey). Bypass this and read some Dorothy Parker instea 
 I found this book to be based more on emotion than fact. The facts that were used were blown way out of proportion and context. While it is always healthy to look at both sides of the coin - politics included - this book would never give a fair representation of the fundamentalist side, because it is so focused on presenting the conservative view from a Gestapo perspective.  
 Also, the book itself is complete crud, being nothing more tangible than one would expect to find in the National Enquirer 
 I agree with another writer who  was the only one who noticed that the A&E Production on DVD IS INDEED MISSING around HALF of the Mini Series that was shown on Sydney's Channel Nine a few years ago. I am glad we still have the old version on Video and if anyone has that version (ie THE COMPLETE Mini Series) with NO great missing Chunks, I would be keen to buy it. I liked Catherine Zeta Jones and most of the acting although I did notice some that was very obviously "pretend" fighting. If I can get a refund from "overman"  from whom I bought this DVD or from Amazon.com INCLUDING the horrible postage we have to pay to get things from USA to Australia OR EVEN A REPLACEMENT BEING THE FULL VERSION I would be happy to return the shortfalling A&E DVD 
 A short book, but too long.  Read like a tract and could have been presented in a long pamphlet.  I generally like Yancey, but you can skip this and re-read WHAT'S SO AMAZING ABOUT GRACE. My favorite 
 I'm a huge Britney fan, but this cd [stunk] so bad.  When I bought it, I thought I was gettin a remix cd of songs like Lucky, Stronger, Satisfaction, and other songs on that cd, but it was just "Oops" when it came in the mail.  Two song, Track Numbers 5 and 7 are over 6 minutes, and 7 is the instrumental of 5 
 I needed to know more about Sarbanes-Oxley for work and ordered this book.  While I was waiting for it to arrive, I went onto the Internet and downloaded some information, including the text of the legislation itself.  I read through the legislation.  I'm not an attorney, and I wasn't motivated to cross reference the other laws/acts mentioned.  In other words I just read the legislation as is, with no legal background.  When this book arrived, I expected it would provide information and/or interpretations that I was not able to get directly from reading the legislation and other free materials.    In truth, I found there was very little, if anything that I hadn't gathered directly from my other sources.  If you are trying to learn what Sarbanes-Oxley is about and choose not to use the available information, this book does describe the basics.    I would not recommend it, because it does not significant add to, or simplify the information readily available for free 
 Politically Incorrect apparently means bigoted, racist, sexist, classist, and freakin' proud of it, woman!  These "guides" are a scary, scary joke written by angry bigots to make open-minded people angry, and to help justify their own prejudices and inablity to let go of the "good old days" when it was considered fitting when a woman got slapped for mouthing off...    What a disgusting view of the world 
 If you follow the trajectory of James Baldwin's writing, you'll see that he established certain themes, then reiterated them in a variety of settings.  His themes are pertinent and show great insight, but if you were to read two or three of his books, by the time you got to the third, you'd say, "O.k., I get it already." Such is the case with Another Country.  If you've read any Baldwin, thematically it's nothing you haven't heard before.  But, his earlier novels were clearly stated, concise, and powerful as a result.  This novel is an unbelievably bloated mess which easily could have been half the length and still gotten its points across.  Every single scene goes on way too long, the dialogue between the characters is interminable and pedantic, and there is an element of melodrama better served in soap operas.   Baldwin has said that this was the novel that meant the most to him, which is further proof that artists aren't necessarily the best judges of their work.  Go Tell It On The Mountain is a masterpiece and most indicative of Baldwin's considerable literary powers, and I would recommend you read that or Giovanni's Room, which is less powerful, but eloquent and substantial.  Another Country is a slog that doesn't repay in substance the efforts necessary to get through it 
   Finkelstein is a one-sided advocate of the Palestinian Arab cause. For some reason he has not bothered in all his years of research to read the Palestinian or Arab press in regard to their intentions towards Israel. Because of this he totally ignores the unrelenting Arab ambition to destroy Israel, and the hate-filled Arab propaganda which is its fundamental note in relation to Israel. This means he gives no credibility whatsoever to the idea that Israel might possibly be engaging in certain military operations in order to, God forbid, defend itself.  . Finkelstein totally ignores Jewish victims of the conflict, and shows no human sympathy whatsoever. Without going into questions of his personal psychology or pathology, it is possible to simply see in his attitude a callousness toward Jewish suffering .  3. Finkelstein claims that supporters of Israel who he calls `philo- Semites' call anyone who criticizes Israel, `Anti-Semitic'. The absurdity of this remark should be apparent to anyone who has ever read an Israeli newspaper, or followed Israeli political discussion. In fact if Jews called anyone who criticizes Jews or Israel ` anti- Semitic' they then would be calling almost every Jew, `Anti-Semitic'. The distinction Finkelstein fails to make is in one sense simply that between constructive and destructive criticism. There are those who criticize Israel with the intention of helping it do better, and those who criticize Israel out of hate and with a desire to injure and even destroy it. Not simply the substance but the whole tone of Finkelstein's remarks put him in the latter category. And it should also be added that with the desire to injure comes the desire to insult and humiliate. This is in fact one of Finkelstein's major traits as writer and person. And one of the reasons he has lost several academic positions is because of his frequent personal abusing of students who had opinions that differed from his.  Finkelstein totally ignores the unremitting hate which has come from the Arab media for the past eight years. He ignores the violence of Arab society in general , and their having time and again initiated violence and war against Israel. His work is totally dishonest, and one- sided.   
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
    I gave this book 1 star because I was so offended as a Christian    I have to admit I am an Evangelical Christian who had never heard of Hugh Hewitt until I found this book in the .99 bin at a Christian Bookstore. After reading it I truly wondered where the Moral Outrage of Christians has gone.    This is pure Machiavellian politics that has nothing to do with anything in Christ's Gospel. Sure there are Moral Absolutes, but for Christians to associate themselves with this kind of xenophobic, racist and unscriptural totalitarianism is at the very least as much an affront to the Cross of Christ as anything in the "Gay Agenda". I am embarrassed and personally truly repentant that a book like this even carries the imprint of a Christian publisher. I would also like to apologize to anyone who might assume that this is a Christian view of the world. The Jesus of the Bible, who is my Savior and Messiah, does not fear either terrorists or multiculturists, but gave his life for them, only asking that they "go and sin no more" and "make disciples of all men". It is the "whitewashed tombs" of Pharisaical hyporites that He condemns.  We can only pray that the kind of America Hewitt envisions never comes about or if it does that we face the Inquisition as "good and faithful servants". 
 I agree with Tinhorn - this is a disappointing effort.  After the first CD, definitely a step down....not a total loss, but rather lifeless 
 For those of you who have not yet read this book: this book is about a white-wannabe black girl who pays way too much attention to her friend's puberty. I have never read a worse book in my life. This book is shallow, boring, and completely pointless 
 Often times fiction is just a vehicle for authors to use all of their ideas and just throw them all into one book.  This is the case here--it took me 4 months to finish because it was so bad.  There is no plot here really.  Much of the time Robbins writes about 5 talking objects which is by far the worst part of this already bad book.  The entire book works up lazily to the climax where a 16 year old belly dances, her vagina visible the entire time--well that's not so bad, but Robbins has spent all the time getting to here so he can preach some of his views which are just more colorful versions of the Celestine Prophecy.  Save your time-this is a bad book 
 I did not find this book helpful at all. It is packed with academic speak and very little practical material. I would recommend Richard Bolles' What color is Your Parachute, Howard Figler's The Complete Job Search Handbook, and J. Michael Farr's How to Get the Job You Really Want (this book is more of a manual and has some great ideas in terms of job searching and how to go about it. This one is definitely a must) 
 I can understand the enthusiasm behind this little tract (it's not a book, though it costs a book's ransom).  I can understand Timothy Freke wanting to reach out and offer his insights into the true nature of reality.  But this just doesn't give us enough.  Wake up?  Yes, he's right.  Most of us are sound asleep.  But yelling wake up! is no more helpful than telling someone in crisis to "pull their socks up."  Meanwhile, there's so much out there that offers truly stunning glimpses into the nature of consciousness...and I don't mean the desperate brain scientists who keep trying to convince themselves and us that all things wild and wonderful are abberant chemicals gone awry in the brain, very much including after-death experiences.  I noticed one reviewer mentioned Seth.  If you can get past the fact that it's "channeled," a real voice that will turn your world inside out is Seth.  Jane Robert's Seth.  I was a Catholic, but I'm still a philosophy freak.  Read it all my life.  And no one and nothing touches Seth for a cohesive and utterly convincing glimpse into reality as it is/isn't...not Plato, not Socrates, not Plotinus, not the Epicurians, and certainly not the later Gnostics.  As for Lucid Living, well...nope.  Not enough for serious, or even not so serious, seekers 
 This third volume of Superman -The Animated Series is really a tribute to the late, great Jack Kirby. Darkseid is introduced with some of the other New Gods that Jack had created. This is because the animators of the series, like Bruce Timm were fans of Kirby's and were inspired and influenced by Jack. You won't be disappointed as a fan of the Superman series either.I know I wasn't. I've been a fan of ALL of the DC Warner Brothers cartoons. The stories and art are well done. 
 This is one of those situations where you CAN jusge a book by its cover! 
 This book might be best described as SOA for managers.  Most of the book covers high level concepts.  In some parts everything is presented as an abstraction, leaving the reader to wonder what the connection with the real world is.  Even as a book focused on a high level overview this book doesn't work.  This should have been a 300 page book.  Who has time to put up with an extra 400 pages?  If your interest is in actually implementing something, you'll need to go far beyond this book.  I've given it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did learn a few things from it. 
 This is a wonderful book to read if you want to imagine yourself living somewhere exotic in an uncluttered space with minimal (or no) possessions.    It's all about design and I'm sure design mavens and architect-groupies will love it.    I picked it up looking for "good ideas" (as advertised in the title) I could use in, or adapt for, my small condo.  In my real life as a middle-class working person living in the US.  I found none.    Pretty pictures, though, of some inventive solutions to putting bed, bath, kitchen, and sitting facilities into small areas.  
 Eddie Coleman completely uses this book to promote his Ad agency.  He talks more about advertising than Mastery.  One good statistic he uses is his conversion rate.  Other than that, if you are not a DP, don't bother 
 This is one of the worst endtimes novels I've ever read.  The dialouge is horrible, the characters paper thin and the plot obvious and boring.  There's much better out there.  Save your money and try We All Fall Down by Caldwell or the Last Day by Kleier.  Both are thoughtful, wonderful reads.  This is neithe 
 there is only one asimov.. and only one douglas adams (who in my opinion is not really all that funny and definitely not in the same league as asimov)  but terry pratchet is neither and he is trying just too hard to be funny.  or my tolerance for fiction has gone down over the year.. 
 This is a work of poor scholarship.  The author's account of Egyptian Jewry is politically filtered.  First, he claims that Egyptian Jews were not supportive of Zionism.  Every Zionist movement was representated in Egypt, and active.  He also suppresses evidence that some prominent Egyptian Jewish personalities were Zionists.  For example, he talks at length about Mourad Farag, but does not mention that he was a passionate Zionist.  Farag's work, Al Kudsiyat, goes unmentioned.     MOreover the largest percentage of Egyptian Jews (45%) went to Israel.  The remainder were scattered between the U.S., France, and other countries, so Israel got the lion's share  The author also trivializes the anti-semitism that existed in Egypt long before the Zionist movement.  There were at least 10 cases of blood libels in the second half of the 19th century.  Moreover, even Egyptian Jews who lived in Egypt for generations were denied citizenship.  He only briefly mentions the Company Law that denied Eygptian JEws their livelihood.  Though he mentioned the three massacres of 1948 in which nearly 90 Jews were murdered, he forgets to tell the reader that no serious trial took place.    The author dwells extensively in the Lavon affair, but only because he can blame Israel.  He does not tell the reader that not one Egyptian or foreign soul was killed or hurt during the sabotage operation.  He also refuses to admit that Egypt committed a crime by condemning two of the ring leaders to death.  The author's political bias blinded him and turned him into a poor schola 
 The fan does work fairly well as an intake fan.  However, in exhaust mode (the mode I need), I can barely feel a breeze from either side of the unit.  It simply doesn't work as an exhaust fan.  Therefore, to accurately describe the fan it may be a 2,470 cfm intake fan and it is about a 2 cfm exhaust fan.  I'm returning it.  By the way, the packing slip from "Air-n-Water" states that a 15% restocking fee that applies to all returns.  I am very unhappy with the fan and will be extremely unhappy with "Air-n-Water" if they try to hit me with a restocking fee 
 Well you know the drill. Some people will like anything that is "artsy" or "out of the ordinary" or "made by that great director". Its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless.  The movie is about incest. It is about sex and adolescence. And, ironically, it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews. The best part of this movie is Eva Green. Or, more precisely, Eva Green's body. I didn't care about her acting (I thought it was mediocre). I just sat there and drunk her body in, wishing that I was that lucky actor (whats his name again?). The only reason to watch this movie is Eva Green. If she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation, then I am glad it happened. The movie is visually rich. In fact, its so rich that Bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see. But I will take it. He captures and celebrates Eve Green's stunning body - every square millimeter of it(including her genitals - the movie is NC17 for a reason), to perfection. Other than that, there is nothing else in the movie. The story is utterly insipid, the old movie clips, the "discussion" of morality or whatever ... nothing interesting. The music is another plus point.  Bottomline, watch it for Eva Green's body. It deserves five stars. But the movie deserves only two 
 The only song worth listening to is "Finer Feelings", hence the one star.  This album was a waste of money.  I'm so glad Kylie's music got 30 times better after this record 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 I've recently discovered Elizabeth Berg and have been greatly moved by 3 of her books. I was really looking forward to this one... though I am married with a child, I certainly do remember the occasional angst of my single days!  HOWEVER, this book is SUCH a disappointment. The whole plot is just a cop-out and the protagonist is not very sympathetic.  I suspect the book might be based in fact, which I suppose would somewhat redeem it.... 
 The publication and subsequent widespread popularity of "The Da Vinci Code" has led to a host of books attempting to delve further into the subject matter and separate fact from fiction.  The authors and producers of these books usually fall into two categories: those of the Christian faith that feel threatened and try to discredit everything Dan Brown presents in his novel; and those who wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Brown and seek to reinforce the subject matter of his novel.  Additionally, in my personal opinion, both of these camps also seem to be motivated by a a desire to capitalize on the popularity of "The Da Vinci Code" for profitable gain.  While these types of exploratory 'history' books (and I use that term very loosely in this case) no doubt succeed in clearing a decent profit margin they fail miserably as researched historical treatises on the subject matter of "The Da Vinci Code".  Both, "The Rough Guide To The Da Vinci Code" and "Da Vinci Code Decoded" purport to be properly researched exploratory works with the former taking the side of discrediting much of Mr. Brown's novel and the latter supporting much of it.  However, what the astute reader will notice is that neither makes its case very well and both are guilty of the same gross error, namely not presenting any tangible historical reference to accompany the myriad of 'facts' (I use this term quite loosely as well) presented.  By this I mean, whenever they present any information, whether it opposes or supports Mr. Brown, there is no specific reference as to where that information came from.  As far as the reader knows, the author could be entirely fabricating the information themselves as there is no footnote and corresponding reference for the reader to check to ensure the author is not just asserting their own opinions as 'facts'.  While that type of writing is entirely acceptable in a fictional novel such as "The Da Vinici Code", it is most unacceptable in non-fictional writing where the claim is made that the book presents researched historical facts.  If the books are so well researched, where are the footnotes and references that will allow the reader to double check the facts themselves?  These books are in essence 'he said / she said" publications where it is the word of the author against the word of Dan Brown, and as such are of no use in the realm of legitimate historical study.  Please do not be fooled by the authoritative style with which these books are written, as they are essentially just someone's opinion and should not be taken as fact.  I would recommend the curious reader who desires to learn more about the subject matter of "The Da Vinici Code" to seek out and read academic historical texts for further information, but at the same time I would suggest taking that with a grain of salt as well.  Historical facts have a tendency to become distorted and manipulated over the years to serve personal and national agendas.  If you don't believe it is in human nature to manipulate historical accounts, consider this real world example: the Japanese government as of this day does not teach Japanese students about the atrocities and war crimes that Japan committed historically in Asia (atrocities and war crimes that are well documented by the rest of the international community).  The details have been stricken, literally, from Japanese school history books.  This is even more important when we remember that Japan actually lost World War II and yet they are still engaging in this type of activity.  Imagine if they had won...furthermore, imagine if the Germans had won: would the attempted genocide of the Jews even be spoken of today much less remembered in a couple hundred years?  These are the types of things one must consider when studying history. So, if you want to learn more about the Da Vinci code, ignore "The Rough Guide To The Da Vinci Code" and "Da Vinci Code Decoded", do your own research, keep an open mind, and decide on your own what seems most likely from a logical standpoint. 
 Berberian's work is one more example of why writers, especially first-time writers, should write about what they know intimately.  It is painfully obvious from his ponderous and endless recitation of his character's physical training techniques and his love for particular kinds of foods, that Viken has nothing else to talk about.  Existentialism?  Hah!  More like pedanticism.  Berberian's characters are flat, uninteresting, and tell us nothing new about the Mideast.  Where is the conflict in his characters?  Where is the multi-layered (and therefore believable) mileu of the cyclist's world?  Where are the characters that could provide an alternate perspective on, or at least discuss, the objective reality of terror?  Most unforgivingly, where is the drama?  Pass on this author, until he decides to write about something he at least sparingly knows, and doesn't have to research from square one 
 The author needs someone to explain to her that arguments develop not simply by stringing one sentence after another and expecting that with a little tape, good cheer, and hope, a coherent line of thought will emerge.  Rather, arguments develop by actually rereading what you have written, revising it so as to clarify the connecting ideas, and making assertions that require some kind of evidence to defend them.  A little reseach along the way wouldn't be a bad idea either.  While the topics being discussed are certainly interesting, the result of this porridge-like prose (it's not at all clear that book represents sustained meditation), is a kind of mush capable of taking any of a number of shapes 
 Several years ago I used DeLorme's Street Atlas with a USB GPS receiver. The software worked but the interface was lousy. This year I tried Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the Delorme software, but still surprisingly clumsy. And the help is possibly the worst I have seen in a Microsoft product (that's saying a lot). Here are some of the problems:  1. Street & Trips is expecting a GPS receiver that uses a **COM PORT**. Are you kidding me? In 2007??? The Delorme Earthmate 20 (usb) will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software, but why is this necessary??? (And it was not trivial to get it to work.)  2. The handling of pushpins (identifying spots on the map), favorite places, and the like, is extremely clumsy. (Although, contrary to another review, you don't to re-enter the information each time. You just save the file and reload it.)  3. Directions are sometimes not so great. Why would you instruct someone to "turn left" if you don't know which direction they're pointing (e.g., when you're stationary in a parking lot)? Much better in such cases to say "head NE" or some such. Freeway exits (at least in So. California) were often not handled well. (One freeway entrance was identified as a "local road", which at the time proved quite confusing.)  4. Why doesn't the software automatically recalculate directions to put you "on-route" once you're off-route? You can push F3, but why is this necessary?  5. I never got the voice providing driving guidance to work. The online help was useless. I'm sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it, but it should be trivial.  6. In general, the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together. I'm not a reflexive anti-microsoft bigot (I bought this software after all), but I find that much MS software is bad precisely because it feels like it's cobbled together without much attention given to integration. It's shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it.  Given this experience, I will probably give the Delorme software another try next time around. 
 My experience with Tacitus in the original was brief and without professorial guidance, so I can't vouch for the accuracy of the translators; however, Church and Bodribb's English is certainly readable if a bit outdated (A trait I like in translations of ancient authors). The lack of footnotes or maps is what dooms this edition, though it probably is directly related to the excellent price. I would only advise purchasing this book if money is that much of a problem for you or if you're only buying as an aid for translation, you dirty cheat you 
 That's okay, Junior, we're just going to put the Lion King away for a little while (puts DVD in trash as kid cries, screaming).  There, see? He's just going to sleep. Now let's go sit over here and talk about why mommy put the Lion King to sleep (kid still screaming). See, honey, the Lion King is a movie that is made by bad, evil people. Even though the Lion King is cute and the cartoons are nice to look at, the people who drew the animals want to do VERY BAD things to you. They want you to HATE yourself, and you know what? These people are EVERYWHERE WE LOOK. They aren't just in the Lion King, they're on your school bus, in your classroom, and in the cafeteria. They might even be your teacher. They might even be people who call you their friend and say you're pretty. Even when they say you're pretty, they're just saying those things to make themselves feel good. What they're really trying to say is that they HATE you and they want to HURT you!! (kid screams again, now scarred for life) Now let's talk about how Mulan says bad things about Asian people, how The Incredibles reinforces stereotypes of female inferiority, about how Buzz Lightyear destabilizes the corporate-controlled capitalist economy that subjugates the Black race, and how Finding Nemo is homophobic. And don't worry, mommy will tell you about these big words after you eat your bean pie, child. Power to the people! 
 I know the book is aimed at "young adults" but I cannot help pointing out that over 100 pages of psycho-babble with a "see the end from 20 miles away" style is just horrible to read! If you have actually read 1984 then leave this "book" alone 
 I really wanted to like this book. I really did.  The illustrations were excellent, and the book was well written.  However, it was also a little disappointing.  I really had been hoping to get some more information on  the lost tribe on the Bunyip and some relatively new antagonists for my  players.  However, the only new tribe was the Iron Riders, a more archaic  name for the Glass Walkers. And while there were some fairly original  fomori, they weren't terribly interesting. Some of the totems and gifts  were all right, but overall I think White-Wolf could have done so much more  with this book 
 Oh come on now! I'm a big fan and this is a big let down 
 This book is so far from Krentz's best romantic novels (Grand Passion, Absolutely Positively), that I would have believed it written by some other romantic novelist because it was so predictable and boring.  The heroine has this "amazing" ability to tell where people have been murdered, but there is no way for her to use this ability to try to solve crimes & contribute to her husband's detective business.  Her husband is a private investigator who somehow manages to stay afloat financially, since he spends most of the book picking out color schemes for his home (Ochre or gold, ooh, the mystery!).  There are a couple of romantic subplots where friends of the couple who have previously been unlucky in love suddenly discover each other & decide that they're perfect for each other.  At the end of the book, you end up with a clumsily-plotted attempt to kill one character, a bunch of references to some nutty mental institution where two of the characters were held captive, three soppily happy couples dancing in the sunlight and one majorly bored reader who wishes she had picked another book for her weekend read 
 After "Lazarus Long" I had high expectations for this audio book.  It seems, however, that Heinlein "lost it" between 1946 and 1961!  The book starts out interestingly enough but once VMS goes out on his own, it becomes a joke!  Heinlein's endless anti-religion, diatribes, voiced through the mouths of VMS and the insufferable "Jubal Hershaw" made me want to chew my leg off, just to get away!  (Apologies to "Hitchiker's Guide!")  I stuck it out though, hoping for a "second wind," but there was no wind, just a SUCKING sound! Jubal is basically Marvin the Robot on downers! Any real person with his outlook would've eaten a gun LONG ago.  VMS is an "Ubermench" strung out on Qualludes!  "I grock this...I grock that...I grock grocking..." Blah Blah Blah.  I didn't grock this book at all! The final scene wherein VMS allows himself to be vivisected reminded me of the "Black Knight" scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail"..."It's only a flesh wound!" Oh, and lastly, what's with Foster and Digby and VMS himself in some sort of weird afterlife "adjusting their halos!?"  Methinks Heinlein may have discovered Acid in his later life. Bottom line, a waste of 16 hours of my time...thank God (yes, THAT God!) I didn't have to pay for it 
 What the heck WAS that? I just watched this and . . . what the heck WAS that?! The cover looked good, but I think they spent 90% of their budget on the cover and didn't have anything left to actually shoot the film. This looked like a junior high school production shot at a sleepover! By the way, there is no house like the one on the cover, there is no little boy on a tricycle . . . there is no reason to watch this.  Unless you just want to laugh at the corny lines and bad acting : 
 I think the book is very flippant and uninformative.  If you are looking for hard facts, skip this one.  I'd like to return it for a refund and I'd be embarrased to pass it on 
     Dershowitz' book is not so much a book about terrorism as it is specifically an attack on Palestinian terrorism and how terrorism relates to the US and our 51st state, Israel.  The author operates from the thesis of why terrorism is effective, and then proceeds to systematically discount every terrorist campaign in the world, leaving only the Israel - Palestine conflict and 9-11 for discussion.  One would expect to find more discussion on other conflicts such as those in Ireland or terrorist acts carried out by North Korea (the ultimate example of state-sponsored terrorism), but they are either nowhere to be found or completely dismissed.  Dershowitz carefully pares down his topic until he ignores practically everything in our century outside of 9-11 and the PLO.     His anti-Palestinian bias becomes more apparent later in his arguments.  His central idea is that terrorist groups feed off the success of other groups.  Because Palestinian terrorism is the most effective terrorist campaign in the world, for the sake of world security they must be defeated.  However, if you follow this logic it becomes apparent that he leaves no room for the possibility that the Palestinians might have a legitimate complaint or that perhaps they deserve certain rights that we in the US generally consider inaliable.  According to his argument, the Palestinians can never see any improvement in their situation, no matter how deserved, because such would be perceived as a victory for terrorism.  Therefore, as far as Dershowitz is concerned, they're just plain out of luck.     Dershowitz's attitude seems to be that the Palestinians should have tried nonviolent protest instead of violence.  He seems oblivious to the fact that the Israelis used violence to sieze Palestine in the first place, and while he admits that Israelis use terrorist-style violence, he never judges them in the same way he judges the Palestinians.    In fact, Dershowitz advocates the use of torture and assassination and seems to praise the Israeli use of these tactics.  I'm at a loss to explain how anyone can advocate nonviolent protest at the same time that they advocate assassination and praise 'preemptive' warfare.  I'm likewise unable to understand how anyone can caution us as to the steady erosion of our freedoms at the same time that they argue for state-sponsored torture.    To his credit, Dershowitz reminds us that even hated terrorists have constitutional rights, and he makes a plea for us to remember that even terrorists deserve due process of law.  But again, his hyprocrisy is stunningly blatant.  How can one argue for universal judicial fairness and advocate torture and assassination at the same time?  These concepts are completely antithetical to a fair, democratic judicial process.       The most frightening argument Dershowitz makes is that it is alright to allow our rights to be degraded as long as the "feel of freedom" is maintained.  (His words, not mine)  He claims that as long as our free speech is protected and our media is critical, it is alright for us to sacrifice our freedom in other ways.       In fact, Dershowitz admits that Palestinians in Israel are second-class citizens, and then says they should be thankful for it because Israel has free speech and a balanced judicial system.  I was previously unaware that bulldozing towns and bombing Palestinian civilians constituted a fair judicial system, and it really is a shame that too few Palestinians actually live long enough to enjoy it.     Anyone who reads this book should be frightened to live in a future Dershowitz America 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 This film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave. I originally saw it for free and afterwards, I still felt screwed. It stank so badly that I checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre. Yeah, I know. Call me "Mister Tact".  A "horror-comedy" that's neither slightly funny nor remotely scary, this film is a supposed sequel to the 1981 horror classic "An American Werewolf in London", (which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made). The filmakers had a lot to live up to and, boy, they blew it in every department. The effects were ludicrous, the cast was lost, the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues, and the director should have been shot (with something other than lots of narcotics). This film is a textbook example of the Hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew.  If you have already been suckered into buying this DVD, I feel your pain. You are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a Heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack 
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 When I began reading this book, I expected to read a story about a young girl growing up with an extended chinese/hawaiian family.  Although this book is filled with Hawaiian and Chinese family tradition, it is merely a collection unlinked childhood memories.  Each chapter is a mini-story within itself and is not related to other chapters.  I was disappointed that the plot was not developed 
 I bought this book in hopes of discovering a better grasp of what foods and combination of foods I should eat, as a vegan, while training for the LA Marathon.  Instead, this is like reading someone's personal diary with absolutely no valuable information whatsoever.  The few hopes he offers as far as a menu plan or even a recipe he leaves out of the book and says there will be a recipe book published later.  So, basically, he wrote this book to try to sell a different book yet to be published.  I have been vegan for only a year and yet my knowledge far surpasses his.  In fact, a lot of his advice is bad, unhealthy, and ignorant.  For example, he claims that taking in absolutely no nutrition before a long training session is a good thing and encourages it in a rather braggert sort of way.  Obviously this guy knows nothing about body metabolism or function. This book is basically from the perspective of someone saying "hey, I'm over 40.  I gave up meat.  I do endurance sports.  Ain't I cool?"  Don't waste your money or time. It is a very frustrating, empty read.  Brendan Brazier's book is a bit better if you're desperate for food ideas while training for endurance sports.  At least with his book you get some menu plans and recipes.  
 I am profoundly sympathetic to the main thesis of this book -- that the present American economic and political situation is marching towards a fascist system.  However, this alleged 'writer' relies too much upon mere juxtaposition and unsubstantiated conjecture to label anyone and everyone whoever enjoyed power in the U.S. to be a "fascist."  The book has much in the way of interesting information, but the conclusions come across as the colloquial ramblings of an undisciplined conspiracy theorist 
 The Encyclopedia of Trading Strategies is well written and is a good book if you are looking for something very technical and mechanical.  I was disappointed with the book.  I thought it would offer chart set ups or set ups per technical indicators.  Instead, it offered codes, etc for setting up mechanical systems. 
 I've purchased seasons one and two thus far. If this third set is as poorly done as the first two, stear clear. If you remember the old LPs that stated "all songs performed by original artists" meant that the songs were rerecorded. The first 2 sets were poorly done. Season One, from NBC has been named "bonus" selections. this is clearly a ploy to force a collector to purchase all seasons just to aquire the true first season.  The music on the series is nothing short of annnoying. It simply is poor and detracts from our collective memory. the picture quality is poor and looks extremely worn and dated. I can't get over the music. It is really that bad. Bad enough that this set should be rejected by consumers.   One can't help but feel cheated when the waited for DVD set lacks the original audio (replaced by truly awful songs), and the picture quality so poor 
 Motion picture messages are so smoothly constructed and mass produced today, audiences would hardly bat and eye if they were seeing anti-intellectualism presented to them in a form that also imputes witchcraft, telekinesis for example.  Big ideas must mean something from outer space has infected the brain; or anything intelligent, resourceful or efficient.  Also foreign language acquisition is held suspect by this piece of government propaganda, we're better off being mono-lingual and ignorant of others around the world.  While not as mudslinging and rife with judicial malpractice as the Salem Witchcraft Trials, movies still libel segments of the population the state has deemed unwanted or suspect for reasons of their beliefs, attitudes and intellectual pursuits.  Then the mudsling is that intelligence must be unnatural and under alien control, that it means something is organically wrong with the brain; of late it has been more popular for the exercise of state oppression to simply label people as mentally ill (without all the cosmic conspiracy angle).  What it really means is that the tireless efforts the government has put in place to destroy the public education system, and to weaponize the culinary water supplies everywhere with a vectored chemical incapacitant wmd, fluoridation, must now jealously and suspiciously interdict any signs of its ineffectiveness at rendering the population functionally illiterate, subaverage in memory, language, logic and mathematics skills.  There is no big important secret cipher system at risk, that the government needs to keep a secret in order to subjugate unwanted populations of chemically inundated citizens; it is plain to see and requires no algorithm to decode.  The pattern is obvious:  exploit, lie, poison and insult the residual intelligence of the population they haven't yet completely wiped out.  This movie is a highly revealing sick statement of an insular, autocratic technological empire crumbling under its own inconsistencies and open acts of war, mob violence and vigilantism on America; a foreign policy of isolationism attempting to disguise corporate colonialism as our outreach, when the overstatements of xenophobia for international languages couldn't be more apparent or reflection of the decline in the U.S. education system.  Demonization of intellectuals is old fascist whining and scare tactic.  It is making more movies than sense because its only card to play is hypnosis in order to evade fairly simple identification of its ideology and modus operandi.  Other than the large dimensions of psychological film project objectives for mass populations the psycorps or planning and budgeting of the Pentagon designs, this film also has latent suggestible side effects that could be harmful to young people prior to the age of disillusionment with the establishment.  The film could instill phobias in young people that academic achievement or the strengthening of their intellect is somehow a demonic or alien compromise, that smart is bad and that dumb is preferred.  Use this film if anything to make a fool of the corruption that thinks we take it seriously.  Who is the more alien-invasion insidiousness anyway?   There are these people out there who think they have big ideas, something to contribute.  They believe in direct democracy, energy conservation, environmentalism, alternative forms of power extraction and won't learn from the coy ridicules of cinematic revisionism not to see others equally, or not bother to learn to speak some of their language.  What's to be done with them?  Perhaps they'll die naturally from the progression of their disease, as they so should.  It seems that would be in keeping with this film's sick prescription.   Oh, and in case you're writing in the newspaper oped style that can't make an argument without  telling people what to think verbatim, remember to begin with the polemic:  "That's what's going on here!..."   
 SPOILERS AHOY!  Disregard the glowing review blurbs.  Despite some good (if misdirected) acting from Stockard Channing, this unbelievable, mean-spirited and coincident-driven mess about a career barracuda (Channing) who joins forces with a young assistant (Julia Stiles) to kidnap and sexually torment an oily young businessman they both have a grudge against is a third-rate sisterhood-bonding mess that looks like a justly forgotten Off Off Broadway play, sorta a fem-lib Mamet opus.  Begins intriguingly but Stiles' character inexplicably degenerates from a hard-working young woman into a junior-grade Fatal Attraction-type psycho who inexplicably draws Channing into her sick plot. Suffice to say that despite dubious nature of their victim's "crime" (turns out he may or may not have been involved in a long ago sexual assault), Channing's character's participation in this near-murder causes her to take this young sociopath under her wing, prompting her to re-examine her whole shallow power-suited lifestyle. Ywan.  Channing was far more believable playing 30-year-old high school senior in Grease. Here, she's just a mid Fifty-something mired in Gunk 
 Most of the proofs that the Morrises give are well thought-out with good  evidence.  However, when they start talking about creation, they base their  proofs on traditions instead of scripture and natural revelation. No matter  how hard the Morrises try, their personal creation theology has never stood  up.  This section stands out like a sore thumb out of what could have been  a great book 
 Results makes a solid case for building blocks that a good Business 101 textbook would tell you make up a company's likelihood for success, but Results misses the mark on identifying or leveraging company personalities.     The term `company personality' is misused.  Instead of a company 'personality', the authors appear to be more accurately describing the maturity or efficacy of a company ~ which is a VERY different realm.  Said another way, the survey tool (and the book) do not describe a company's personality, they describe a company's level of dysfunction.   Results illustrates a preferred end of the efficacy spectrum labeled Healthy in which companies are said to have mature capacities for what we know are best practices for decisions, org charts, metrics, and performance infrastructure.   On the Unhealthy end are companies that have not developed similar capacities.   Results would then have us believe that all companies should aspire to become the same personality.  Herein lies the misnomer of the term `personality'.  The Healthy-Unhealthy spectrum of dysfunction offers a simplistic explanation of what makes a company 'work', but it is only two-dimensional.   A company's personality is THREE dimensional.   A company's personality is also founded on its core values, core beliefs, signal behaviors, its attitudes, and its vision.     If you are looking to leverage success through understanding your company's personality, read Companies are People, Too (Fekete, 2003) instead.  This book (and tool set) offer a well rounded approach to understanding company personalities and provides a way for all company personalities to have their place - and still be successful!   Intuitively, it makes more sense to assert that all company personalities are necessary to create a diverse and creative market.   For leaders within a company, it is imperative to identify (and identify with!) the unique and salient strengths of their company's personality.    Only armed with this information can a company distinguish itself from its competitors.     We can initiate change in business practices, but we can not inherently change a company personality - nor should we try!    The idea of changing the personality of a company would be like trying to beat gravity!   Results does offer sound, basic business lessons regarding infrastructure necessary for business success, but it does not fulfill on the promise of understanding and leveraging a company's personality to get there.   
 I loved Moneyball but this is not interesting enough to finish. This reminds me of a book about TV's Rifleman, Chuck Connors, who died before the author did any in-depth interviewing. I am not a current baseball fan so I only knew of James from reading Moneyball. This book is mostly a rehash of James' comments, some from about THIRTY years ago. Very little of this book is based on current interviews with James by the author.  Now I am leery of trying "Baseball by the Numbers. 
 As I recall, 1967 was not the most prolific year for movies and Point Blank,in my opinion, would be one of the worst films I have ever watched.  Notwithstanding the very violent nature of the film, the acting by such notables as Lee Marvin, Carroll O'Conner and Angie Dickinson continually appear to search for conviction with their dis-jointed and nonsensical dialogue. Flashbacks, San Quentin, the San Francisco skyline cannot save this film from the trash heap of celluloid history. If your a Lee Marvin fan, better to watch "The man who shot Libery Valance" twice, than waste your time on Point Blank. Your disposition will be better for it 
 This is a terrible book, written by somebody who is totally ignorant about football (please, use the proper name for the game) and seems to have decided to write a book based on secondary sources, puff pieces and ignorant oversimplifications.   It would take too long to discuss the numerous inaccuracies, exaggerations, mistakes and so forth present in this horrid tract. Just as an example, when dealing with Jewish football he never mentions the peregrinations of Israel through UEFA and Oceania (for WC qualifications). Yet this would be exactly the kind of topic to be dealt with in a book purporting to explore the intesection of 'soccer' (sic) and geopolitics.   Compare this with Kapuscinski's 'The football war' for a vastly superior and more intelligent treatment. 
 i had it it lated awile(1-2months)enough to last till it wouldn't open! other things happened i didn't like                 DON'T GET IT PEASE IT'S A WASTE!!! 
 I am an avid reader, and I will finish a book no matter how difficult it is, or how boring it is, and I couldn't finish this one. It was so dry - and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I was really disappointed 
 I knew this book was a marketing ploy. ''Supposedly'' written by one of the deceased plane crash passengers onboard the doome flight Oceanic 815 in the tv show LOST, this new-found book was, as the story goes, published postmortem for our enjoyment. I did not buy the book to find secrets on the show's consipracies. I was honestly curious about what this book would have to offer. But this juvenile and badly written mystery has very little to offer.  Investigator Artisan is used to the very easy cases he picks up. But when Clifford Widmore hires him to find Alexander, his lost twin, Artisan picks up a case that... well I don't really know what 'that' is since the mystery is practicaly nonexistant in this book. Artisan travels to California, South Keys, Cuba, Australia. And for what? Well just for the nice settings it seems. Why is it so important that he finds Alexander? Why care?  The book is slim but even at only 260 pages, reading this one felt like an eternity. Badly written with silly situation and ridiculous dialogue, the whole thing made me grown and grind my teeth. When Artisan finally arrives in Australia, he meets Pru, a woman who seems perfect for the first three pages. But her secret identity is too quickly revealed and the plot stalls yet again. Why add this character when she obviously offers very little to the story, if anything at all? This book is full of whys, just not the right kind of whys.   And even for Lost fans, this one offers little. The so-called hints to find in this book about the show's conspiracy seem tacked on for no particular reason and quite unnecessary. Why add these three or four quick scenes at all? Why publish this book at all?  A great mystery needs one key element. A mystery. This one had very little of it to be found. You can guess the ending from a mile away and none of the characters are ever interesting enough for you to care for any of them. Skip this one. Stick to the tv show. 
 This is a nice compact guide with many great photos. It is organized quite nicely and is a great help in finding your way around Washington DC. Unfortunately, this book has not been updated since 9/11, and contains a great deal of out dated material. The book does have a sticker on it saying it is being continually updated, but the version currently being shipped is not up-to-date. When using this guide make sure you call ahead for visiting any government agency, building or office 
 This is arguably George Michael's most personal offering to date where he sings of love (American Angel), the Past (Round Here) and death (Mother Had A Brother)...All tracks that tick along quite nicely. But that is the problem. For an artist so talented, he really needs to be pushing boundaries and not producing background lounge music !! He lifts the pace somewhat with the best track 'Amazing', 'Flawless' - with it's pumping disco beat, and the political 'Shoot The Dog' (not available on all CD's as the song was pulled off the American version)..But it is not enough to recover the uneventfulness of this collection...What you do get for your money is at max 4 decent tracks, George's beautiful voice and perfect production...not sure if that is enough to pay the asking price 
 A mildly better read than Rochefort's first book, "French Toast" (which is so infuriating it's difficult to finish), and of somewhat broader scope, this one manages to be both meandering and repetitive as well as occasionally self-contradictory in her supposed observations. Inserted snippets from other writers only serve to highlight the lack of depth in both her observations and her choice of corroborating comments (which often don't corroborate!). It is amazing that she has lived so long in Paris and retained so narrow a focus. This book is really a waste of time

 This album is incredibly ambient with lots of electronic sounds floating, and breathy voices echoing in and out of the stratosphere. Pacific is simple in its structure; and for the most part is listenable. At timed it tries to do way too much of the underwater country and emo blend for the eardrums, but their down-tempo jinglebell opiate trip is a recommendation if you like slower music that's stuck between trying to impress the scenesters and rehashing acoustic grunge. Overall I'd say this album would be perfect for a midnight mescaline trip on a west-coast beach, or some other equally applicable deviation. The group includes Lucas Jensen, clay, and Howard Hudson, and is currently playing shows to support the release.

 I've heard a lot about this book, and in fact I will be involved in a faculty summer discussion group about it. Some people I respect think very highly of it. I can't for the life of me understand why. Moses deserves nothing but credit for his history of activism and his obvious talents and commitment as an educator. But he is utterly unconvincing in his argument that math literacy is a central civil rights issue. His whole argument seems to be based on the increasingly discredited "new economy" thesis about jobs and calls for "economic access" as a "radical" change similar to those in the 1960s. I disagree heartily. His attempt to link math education with the civil rights movement is a stretch, and I think he trivializes his own experience. His discussion of cultural experience as the basis for education is nothing new. And I still don't know what the "Algebra Project" is!  I found the description in the appendix to be even more alienating and incomprehensible than my high school calculus teacher, who flunked me.  If Mr. Moses is getting kids to demand algebra classes, more power to him--he is doing something right. He is probably a far better teacher than I am. But this book leaves me cold and confused.  I look forward to my discussion group--perhaps they will show me what I'm missing, but I doubt it 
 I was looking forward to using what I learned from this book to implement balanced scorecard strategy with my small business clients.  There is so little useful information, I didn't even finish reading the book.  The last chapter and appendix are literally the only portions I found helpful.  Look elsewhere 
 The "Rise" of the Cherokee nation is nowhere to be found in this book.  In fact the "Fall" is well underway before chapter one, and continues to this day with the publication of tripe like this. Any fair depiction of a clash of cultures needs to see each culture in it's context.  Ehle doesn't seem to attempt this.  His descriptions of Cherokee and settler life make no attempt to relate to their specific histories, but merely poke at them with a judgemental 20th century stick. Two stars are simply because he has thrown out many names that anyone with a serious interest in the subject can use as tools for research 
 Though I respected Allan Bloom's translation and introduction to Rousseau's "Emile", "The Closing of the American Mind" shows his inadequacy as a social theorist as well as an academic.  The worthy, though somewhat obvious, point here is Bloom's recognition of America's movement away from intellectualism.  Ironically, this work filled with tenuous arguements makes a case that intellectuals (if one considers Bloom this) have very little to offer (and may be incapable of understanding) society. His comments on music, culture, and race are embarrassingly naive and insipid.  One of the more glaring deficiencies here was the treatment of German philosophy; I don't know that there is a notable scholar who has more misunderstood Nietzsche than Bloom.  He should stick to translating French and leave interpretation up to more worthy critics.    
 This is a recipe book based on a diet philosophy but does not include enough details or instructions to be labeled a diet book 
 The concept of a faerie realm where technology and magic exist side-by-side is an intriguing one. I've read some of Swanwick's short fiction and found it enjoyable enough, so on a friend's recommendation I gave this novel a try.  It failed for me on many different levels. In tone, the novel is unremittingly cynical and bleak. Swanwick depicts a thoroughly corrupt fey society with no apparent redeeming qualities. It is a dark mirror of modern western society with the grunge dial turned up to eleven, cyberpunk with pixies and dragons. Unfortunately Swanwick does not convey any sense of how or why this mish-mash of sorcery and science came to be or is supposed to work. There aren't any apparent ground-rules governing what technology works and what does not. Along the same lines, there aren't many clear principles of magic outlined either.   Even the structure of faerie society is inscrutable. You don't get a glimpse into WHY the powers that be are acting as they do, no sense of a guiding principle other than simple but pervasive corruption and cruelty for the sake of cruelty. Just when a rule or a law is presented it is shown that it means nothing. I could relate to this if those in charge were at least clever in their manipulations and observations. But they're simply opaque.  I have no idea of what is NOT supposed to be possible in this setting, no sense of the boundaries that might limit character's choices and thus make their decisions more meaningful. Most of those characters seem to make their choices based on one of two driving motivations--they are either supernaturally doomed to a certain fate or they are greedy, grasping bastards. The amoral main character often drifts about, guided only by a fate that seems largely out of her conscious control. She seems to break free at the end, but that's unclear as well. Even the sex lacks empathy--most of it is literally a mechanical ritual, and much of that has a dirty feel to it. Not the dirtiness of pornography so much as the sensation of finding a used condom in a wastebasket.   The result is that this world resembles a chaotic stage peopled with caricature after caricature of creatures from fantasy and folklore dressed in leather jackets and snorting magical drugs until one form or another of deus ex machina emerges from off stage (again literally, the Iron Dragon itself) to shove the plot along. It is surrealist more than it is either science fiction or fantasy. In fact, it reads more like an attack on certain types of heroic fantasy.   I was going to call this novel undisciplined, but I get the feeling that all of these choices were made very deliberately by the author in service to an ultimate goal that honestly, as a reader, I could not understand. I can accept a story that sacrifices sympathetic characters to explore a milleu in detail, or a story driven by character that has limited plot, or even a suspenseful plot filled with twists and turns that gives little of plot or setting. But a story that seems to strive to be disorienting is beyond me. 
 I try to read previous reviews before writing my own.  In this case, the Publisher's Weekly review (on this web page) just about says it all.  And for the life of me I cannot see the "brilliance" attributed by some reviewers to this book.  It is often interesting, but certainly not path-breaking.  "Why Geography Matters" fails to deliver regarding Geography as such. The author says that there is no simple, clear-cut definition for the  discipline of Geography, and bemoans the demise of Geography departments in U.S. universities.  He tries for a definition, yet his case studies (climate change, China, and terrorism) fail to demonstrate any particular skills or discipline that can be uniquely be attributed to Geography.    The case studies are interesting, but could have been written by an skilled, hard-working journalist.  A few maps (nice) do not add up to a discipline.  By the way, in the early part of the book he spends time explaining maps and how to read them; useful for beginners, perhaps, but a waste of time for me (an experienced map reader).  My final comment relates to a feeling I get from some arguments in his cases, especially about global terrorism.  He sees powerful forces in the world, and uses maps to show tentacles of the far-reaching Islamic terrorist network(s). The not so credible leap is to buttress (?) his case by heavy lines on maps - purportedly showing direct ties (routes) back to known concentrations of Islamic terrorists. Lines such as these may look good from a great distance, but as often as not distort or conceal as much as they reveal 
 I found this book to be close to useless--extremely hard to figure out how it's supposed to be organized, close to impossible to find anything 
 I recently purchased this software and had to uninstall it.  In my case, I was unable to get into my Quicken account, which is password protected.  One of the features of Confidential is an "Information Vault" which stores all passwords.  I was prompted to enter the Quicken one as well, but chose not to as I felt this would defeat the purpose of having a password set up in the first place.  After that, when I would enter the Quicken password, my machine would just hang up.  The only way I could get in was by opening it in safe mode.    I believe that this product sounds appealing on the surface, but when you get down to it, it promises more than it can deliver.  I also think that when it comes to internet security, the best solution is to take reasonable precaution.  If you respond to an e-mail requesting your account numbers and passwords, a software package is not going to save you.  I purchased this product based on my previous experience with Norton products and have been quite satisfied with their performance.  Thus, I was extremely disappointed with this product 
 Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series.  However, I was very disappointed with this book.  One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such).  I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)!  I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book.  Also, I found the book to be too gritty.  It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books.  It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read.  So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order.  Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it.  I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient.  This is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order 
 I haven't received this product yet and I'm pretty upset about it. I've requested that someone contact me about this problem and I haven't been given an answer.  I think I'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer.   Where is the product I bought??? 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 The author presented quite a rosy picture on China. On privatization, this book praised the successful gradual approach of the government. On institutional reform and liberalization, the market forces and foreign investors seem to be transforming China into a "rational" and democratic system.  Although the author distances himself from the neoliberals on the issue about privatization, his logic on institutional transition and modernization nevertheless make him more of a neoliberal than otherwise. This book described the policy reforms and changes of social control mechanism nicely, but not the social problems and challenges resulted from the reform.  Optimism is fine, but downplaying the uncertainties and social ills associated with globalization is not. The excessive optimism of the book make it like an English version of a Chinese official textbook 
 this album is terrible.  just useless noise.  i also own electric pink and very emergency.  if you liked those albums, you will agree that this one is garbage 
 I have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational. Recently I have subscribed to Shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer. Its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks !!!! 
 There is a reason why some things are cheap, and it's because they are...ummm...cheap. Bad frame, uneven color on the glass. Polarizing filter aside from having AIR BUBBLES on front glass, almost falls apart. Screwing and unscrewing them is a pain. If you are even a little bit serious about photography, don't waste your money on this set. Get yourself at least a set of HOYA filters 
 Don't see this. see the version with Jackie Chan. It is much more exiting because there is karate. Plus the new version with jackie is hillarious. nice and crud 
 This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing that stopped me from demanding my money back at the end was the fact that I saw it in a free sneak preview.  By the end of movie you don't like any of the characters and you don't care what happens to them, even the ones that started out sympathetic and likable.  The third time Jack Nicholson's character gets beaten with his own golf clubs you're torn between wishing they'd just kill him already and wishing they'd kill you instead so you don't have to sit through anymore of this crap.  Save your time and your money, turn around and walk away from this one.  I wish I had 
 Most of these stories were writen for the Saturday Evening Post and later compiled in book form (the copy I have is a [older]1950s paperback, not the current pricey literary collection).  Captain David Grief, called the Son of the Sun for his body's ability to tan perfectly, is a trader, entrepreneur, and adventurere in the south seas.  In each of the eight episodes which comprise the book, he has a less than spectacular adventure which he solves using the combination of brawn and brain.  There's not enough excitement to be true pulp fiction, and the stories are too slow in developing to interest youthful readers, so it begs the question:  who comprises the intended readership?  I read them because they were writen by London, and as such are well crafted, even if boring.  Unlike many of his other works, I won't be reading this one again 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 Feels like sleeping on a rock, hard like a rock. I wake up everyday with a headache. I slept much better with my old, 10 year old pillow 
 This version of Stone Soup leaves a sour taste in my mouth.  At the beginning I was especially disappointed that there were no polite words like please and thank you.  The boy also tells instead of asking.  The other thing I don't like is that the old woman basically lies about not having anything to eat.  Both of these issues are bad examples for my child 
 I agree with another review posted above-- don't waste your money on this book.  I was looking for concrete, real things to do with my preschooler.  The book suggests things like keeping a candle on your table and lighting it, then blowing it out, after each child says a prayer before every meal.  I can't see how that's sharing the Catholic faith, nor does it seem practical.  It also suggests things like taking your child to church, teaching them the sign of the cross, and praying with them.... all of which are common sense to most parents 
 I think this book ruined any small chance I had of getting back together with my ex-husband who is a beloved physician in our community.  I had read the reviews on Amazon and was misled into believing the advice in this book worked.  It did not and (it almost landed me in jail.)    Michele told me to never give up.  Well I should have.  I totally humiliated myself in front of our kids.  What happened was we were not getting along and we had not had sex in years.  He moved out to get space and to think.  He thought we should split to protect the kids from our fights.  He wound up making male and female friends which drove me bananas.  I picked up Michele's book and it all went downhill from there.  And when I say downhill, I mean downhill.  I went nuts.  This book made me go crazy, and in my mind every woman he knew became "OW's" or "Other Womans".  I started stalking him screaming, "But you said 'til death do us part" and other idiotic stuff.   Because Michele told me to never give up unless my husband abused me, I went to the hospital and to his medical office to "talk".  One time I even kicked him  because he would not do what I said and admit to an affair (which I later learned he was not having.)  I went to his apartment and laid on the doorbell in the middle of the night.  I called up all of his women friends and called them names.  I am embarrased to admit that one time I saw my ex driving with a female and swerved into the incoming lane of traffic to block them with my car.  When he was at friends' houses for get togethers, and would not return my calls, I just knocked on the door even if it was midnight and I did not know the people who lived there.  I went thru all his phone bill and started calling every number on there I did not recognize.  Michele told me to fight for my marriage so I would have the peace of knowing I tried, so I dug my heels in and fought.  The list goes on and on.    Well the whole "hang on no matter what" approach backfired.  My ex-husband thinks I am nuts and won't speak to me.  Fortunately he was kind enough not to get a restraining order.    Now, with the passage of time, I understand that a marraige involves two people and each of us has the right to stay in it or get out of it, without being bad people.  In my place of hurt and anger, this book justified my feelings of victimization, hindered my ability to accept responsibility for part of the failure of our marriage, and inflamed my own sense of self-righteousness and denial.  In short, I  was led to believe I could do no wrong because I was on the righteous path of saving my marraige.  Do yourself a favor, and just get a good therapist to help you grieve when you know it is over.  This books prolongs the pain and is quite destructive in the long run.  Try Albert Ellis' "Guide to Rational Living" instead.  I mean it.  Good luck.   
 This is the longest textbook I have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that. I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior. You'll actually begin to understand how investment really works, without getting bogged down by the numbers, terminology, and jargon 
 This book is centered around a few good insights into human behavior, but the execution - in other words, the actual writing of the book around these concepts - is done so poorly that the whole package loses credibility. I have observed a better level of scholarship from "Prevention" magazine. There are constant one or two line statements which need at least a chapter of discussion and detailed justification - and where I know these one-liners to be incorrect from other readings on evolutionary biology, the credibility of the whole book comes into question. This is a shame, because there are some really good points about satiety and the biochemical basis for "happiness" as opposed to "pleasure". The authors also pad it out with irrelevant material (Edison's youth - interesting enough, but completely off the point) and laborious explantaions of concepts which the reader would surely be familiar with (anyone prepared to read about dopamine and serotonin already understands geometric progression!). They even repeat an entire page, word for word, of material presented earlier. The final straw is the plug for their clinic where you can be saved from your misguided instincts - this apparent ulterior motive calls their whole message into question. Reader, buy a copy of Burnham + Phelan's "Mean Genes" instead. It's better written, better researched and will give you some better coping strategies 
 Very poor, low quality 2nd rate models, way below expectation 
 I would give this book a zero, if it were possible...  Anyone that wants to follow this book is more than likely screwing up their child. I would consider "Doctor" Ezzo's philosophy a form of child abuse. This thing is the most awful, upsetting piece of parenting literature I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!! I don't understand, WHY would parents not want to go to your baby at night when he is crying?  WHAT is wrong with loving your baby, cuddles, and attending to their needs???  Oh, yeah I forgot....American parenting seems to given way to the form of training your baby like a puppy, fitting "convieniently" into your lives, with alot of distance, no empathy, No trust, little to no communication, little emotional bonding, and in the future, this results in children who have attachment problems in later life, trouble regarding relationships, and practically seem to be teaching them to be independent and self sufficient from the time they are brought home from the hospital....  How heartbreaking.   Sorry, I don't beleive in the form of abuse as this book is about. and I wish more parents felt the same as I do. 
 Great Product but shame on Amazon for selling it without telling people that it is old software.  Kudos to Acronis for giving me a free upgrade to 10.  Acronis 10 is absolutely wonderful 
 What a rip-off....I agree it is the first comic..but sure is not the best value for your money.  
 Sinead O'Connor is One of the best Stylist Singers over the past 20 years to me.problem with her material is that at times She can be heavy handed with the Material. this Album doesn't move me because She doesn't need to be doing any collaborations. Her Instrument of a voice should easily be able to carry any song.this collection seems tossed together as to feeling like a Cohessive Album on a whole to me.with the right material Sinead could make a Pretty Good to Very good Album with the right musical match up&Hook up.this ain't it 
 Dont bother buying this book it,s far too technical for anyone except a pro with a flash machine shop 100 parts (some tiny) heaps of springs and no ma 
 I thought this was a neat idea but silicone in the oven is not. Our house smelled like plastic 15 minutes into baking a cake in one of these at 350 degrees in the oven. The cake was ruined & the silicone cake pan smelled of the cake even after a thourough washing. I like my silicone pot holders & threw out all my cloth ones that were a fire hazard, but I have to say that I don't recommend cooking anything in silicone pans. Use air bake double insulated non-stick pans instead, which are tried & true 
 I must admit that a misguided person gave me this book. Worse yet, she expected me to swoon and join her on my knees and pray for rapture.   Of all the foolishness that is damaging our world, LaHaye's products must be among the worst culprits. I managed to finish this book, and between laughter and rolling of eyes, all I can say is "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY." 
 When I bought the XBox on 6-11-06 it came at a very good rate of time, my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke I don't feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months. I can't say the  person that sold me the XBox has even tried to email me since I've emailed him , hmmmm. 
 I was intrigued by the title of this book, since I come into contact with all sorts of dogs regularly and am often asked advice about issues like possession guarding, dog-on-dog aggression, etc. However, the advice in this book is by no means anything I would ever pass on. Most issues are dealt with by correcting the dog harshly, shaking him, dragging him by the leash, and similar awful methods. The author's 'cure' for a dog that growls and snaps from under the bed is to daftly drag him out by the lead, and if he happens to bang his head on the way out, so much the better! She advises owners of dogs with fear aggression towards strangers to severly reprimand the dog with voice and leash corrections every time he becomes agitated around another person. This is a ridiculous way to 'help' your dog and will most likely only make the aversion worse. I noticed that Ms. Benjamin has also written a book that claims to use positive training methods, but unless her philosophy has changed from one book to the other, I would not recommend any of her material to anyone else. There are plenty of truly humane training guides out there, don't waste your money on this 
 of us who don't care to be grossed out I want to warn that this book is not for all Christians. It had quite a bit of unacceptable crudeness 
 I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing.  The book was interesting enough but not very useful.  I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful.  I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle 
 I liked Ocean's Eleven but this movie was just ridiculous.  Someone seemed to think that if you get enough big celebrities in one place and try to make it "stylish" you'll have a good film.  Unfortunately, the plot, dialogue, and even the internal logic of the plot is just poorly done.  The clever banter isn't clever.  The plot is slow and dull.  And without giving too much away (although you really should pass on this movie!) there is a plot twist involving the Julia Roberts character that is so ridiculous as to be arrogant.  Overall, a terrible film and a terrible waste of everybody's time 
 This book was mediocre. The stories are not really atypical for anyone in the medical field. To write a good medical book, someone needs to have had an amazing career, really love medicine, have spent time in an obscure field, have an innovative spin, or be an excellent writer. Unfortunately, Vertosick brought none of these to this book.   His stories were not really unusual or atypical - they were things you can find in any field of medicine (the pregnant woman who refuses treatment even though she will die, the abandoned baby in the hospital, etc.). The writing was weak - it didn't feel like someone who especially enjoyed writing or had a knack for it. Sometimes it felt like emotional manipulation - bad writing pulling out all the tearjerker stops.  He also seems to have a blind spot to his own ego; all docs have huge egos, and need to be a little bit self-mocking about it, which he is not. (Repeated many times: "If it was easy, anyone would do it.")  The most interesting part might be for someone to see behind the scenes how people are chosen for medical fields - in his case, a fluke landed him in neurosurgery, and how they train.   That said, there were a few funny stories - like the guy who carved "You suck" to another resident on a skull, which of course later had to be reopened and everyone found out. Funny story, which anyone who has ever worked in a hospital can believe, yet it was hard for me to believe that this didn't result in an expulsion from a program.   Vertosick probably would have had a much better book by bringing his stories to a ghostwriter. He tried to walk the line between the harsh, sarcastic, yet funny medical memoir and the sensitive, isn't-this-amazing kind, missing both. There's tons of good medical writing out there - skip this one. Try David Delvin's It's a Doc's Life instead - that's where Vertosick was aiming 
 Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them.  It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's.  Not any more.  Inform yourselves, people.  I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics.  It's overwhelming.  Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world.  Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 I teach third graders who read at a 5th-9th grade level. The first problem with this book is that, on the back, in huge, yellow letters, is, "Learn more about your Christain heros!  Read what traditional  educators try to keep from you!"  Not a good thing to send home. 	  This book was much too difficult for them, not just because of the  unnecessarily thick language. It is very poorly written.  The prose is  wordy and full of characters who are only mentioned once and then  forgotten.  The children claimed to like and understand this book, but  their retention and actual understanding was nil 
 Buckley is obviously a sincere believer in Catholicism, and it is for that reason, and that reason only, that he wrote this book. ... It is not an autobiography, nor is it in any way spiritual. It deals with a few intellectual issues in Catholicism, and a few religious stories from his life. If you're looking for a way to pass the day without rousing your intellect, read this book. Or read a better book 
 Had the printer for just over a year with light use.  I started getting numerous error messages, then the printer would stop printing in the middle of a page or I couldn't get it to print at all.  Spent over two hours in a hp chat session that made little sense - (was told to push buttons my printer doesn't have, and when I told the rep that nothing happened after a procedure to re-set the printer, she replied "great, that means it worked.")  Was then offered the option of getting the printer serviced for $290, the same price I paid for it a year ago, or upgrading to a C6180 for $300, which is $20 more than the current price on Amazon.  This product has been a waste of time, money and energy 
 this books chapter titles were random as hell and so was the book. its so weird.  there is no plot whatsoever. i hated it, don't buy it cuz it sucks major balls 
 This fan does not have enough power to even come close to blowing out the hot air from even the smallest room.  Go for the industrial strength, expensive ones 
 After 2 attempts at having this shipped to me, and both times having it arrive broken.  I have given up this model.  It's a shame that the poor packaging on the machine is the reason for the rowers rating.  If you can buy one at the store, it may be a great unit, but don't let it go UPS 
 The subject matter is dramatic intriguing and full of genuine anguish, but the writing is so overblown and self-satisfied that one has trouble finishing any of the stories here. The author can't keep away from cliches and hackneyed situations and characters and finally you give up expecting anything fresh or any character who doesn't fit a stereotype 
 With excitement I looked forward to learning more about Dr. Edelman's interesting ideas in detail in this book, only to be served yet again philosophical musings 
 Even though this movie had good actors in it, I would not recommend it.  I especially was turned off by the language and I'm sorry to say this ended up in my trash and this was a first for me to do that 
 The pronunciation of kanji in romaji killed the functionality of these cards for me.  Why would anyone learning to read Japanese, want to read the pronunciations in anything but hiragana?  I also found a number of mistakes with the cards.  I've returned the cards and ordered the White Rabbit Press kanji flash cards.   
 I haven't recieved a single copy so I can't really review it. All I can say is the amazom service is terrible 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 I thought this DVD would be fun. It's got a fantastic feature that allows you to customize your workout, but I was really disappointed with the content. It was poorly organized, short, and not very fun. I bought it the day it was released and am already getting rid of it. Don't waste your money. If you want a great workout that's fun, get Carmen Electra's striptease workout. The best are 1 and 2. 
 Like many of you are thinking about, I bought this through a website (Apple). I bought it based on the name brand, partnerships, and design (I must admit, it is a very nice design - in theory) figuring, "Hey, Nike invented this additional sensor and must have figured out a way to fit into a nice little package...I'll spend $30."  IT DOESN'T FIT CORRECTLY & YOU CANNOT SEE THE SCREEN. This armband is NOT FUNCTIONAL! I even tried to make it work by fitting some tissue at the bottom to raise it to its "intended" position, but inevitably the tissue shifted during the run.  I used the Nike+ armband a total of three times over a 10-mile period and IT CAUSED PROBLEMS DURING EACH RUN.  First, I had trouble adjusting the volume. Second, I accidentally kept pausing my workout trying to play my "Power Song" (center button on Nano).  Third, on my longest run, just today, I accidentally erased the workout trying to end the workout without taking the Nano out of its case (I still don't know how I did this).  I was so frustrated after that third negative occurrence that I immediately went out and bought a different case. I'm not going to name drop, but just type in NIKE+ armband and there are several other options (okay, I will name drop).  My favorite, (especially because I did not want to purchase the Nike+ shoes) was the Marware Sportsuit Relay; this set comes with a neoprene Nike+ sensor pouch (to attach to your current running shoes) and a wrist/arm band that covers the entire Nano with room for the additional Nike+ transmitter. Bottom Line - Nike+ system and partnership with Apple Nano = AWESOME! Honestly works perfect and I couldn't be happier so far, but don't give Nike any more $ for this specific armband. Hopefully we will see enough bad reports, and Nike will come out with a new, more functional design. 
 I recall seeing this movie in a theater way back in 1981, when it was first released, and thinking (at the time) that it was very entertaining. In a fit of nostalgia, I recently rented the DVD and discovered that my initial, youthful impression was way off base. Like Shelly Winters and fish, this movie does not age well.  I have always been a great fan of Jeff Bridges (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot was a classic) and would have sworn that he never appeared in a bad movie....until I (re)saw this one. Bridges plays a gigolo/boat salesman who never works or commits to anything, which becomes quite tiresome as the movie progresses. His life is a sham and he constantly seeks the easy way out. I can accept this, but would have preferred some growth, some improvement in his character as the movie progresses. None is forthcoming. Worst of all, he lacks the sly, roguish charm we always expect from old Jeff...he is simply a boring, loutish, manipulative loser.  John Heard, appearing rather young and slim (compared to now) is ridiculously loud and obnoxious as the title character, Cutter: a badly injured Viet Nam vet who uses his disabilities as an excuse whenever his foul, drunken mouth gets him in trouble (which is often). Shouting and cursing is simply not acting...if it were, we could all be stars, and in this case, while I believe we are meant to find Cutter to be a troubled but amusing character, he is simply repugnant. It has been suggested that Heard deserved an academy award for his performance, but was not even nominated (big surprise), perhaps for "political" reasons. I contend that he was not nominated because his grating, annoying performance never rose above the level of school yard tantrum. It was awful. I would submit to root canal surgery rather than endure another minute of his ranting dialog.  The only good characterization is by Lisa Eichorn, as Heard/Cutter's long suffering, alcoholic (who could blame her?) wife, who seems strangely amused and tolerant of his boisterous, annoying behavior. Perhaps she knows a side of him that is simply not presented in the movie. She presents a vulnerable, touching performance....the only redeeming virtue in this otherwise unremarkable movie.   The plot is extremely slow moving, centering around the brief and indistinct witnessing by Bridges' character of the disposal of a murder victim. The very next day (what a coincidence !!!), while attending a parade, he believes that he sees the murderer, who happens to be a rich and powerful man. Rather than go to the police with their hunch, Cutter hatches a hair-brained plot to blackmail the rich guy....if he pays, then he must be guilty. He also enlists the help of the murder victim's sister, who seems totally unemotional, considering that her sister was brutally murdered two days before, and acts like she is along on a field trip to the zoo....which is no real problem, since she simply disappears from the cast long before the conclusion.   The characters spend what seems like hours arguing, harranging, shoving, and degrading each other while they try to hatch their flimsy plot. Several times, my finger was poised over the "STOP" button on my DVD control, itching to put an end to this increasingly annoying shout-fest. I stuck it out to the climax, which is so unlikely, so utterly preposterous that it leaves you shaking your head in disbelief. I, like many of the other reviewers, must have been blinded by nostalgia, but harsh reality is that this is simply not a good movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this turkey....other than watching Lisa Eichorn, it really, really, really isn't worth the time or effort. 
 This was a cute book, but enough with the detailed descriptions! It was as if the author couldn't come up with enough words to fill her  contract, so had to fill in with exhaustive lists of every food item Holly had for dinner, including how it was prepared. I found myself skipping over entire paragraphs of stuff because it added absolutely nothing to the story. In one part there was like a page and a half of her making SALAD for dinner! And reporting on EVERY.SINGLE.TIME she checked her e-mail? Give it a rest! I get that she checks her e-mail frequently!  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. I managed to get through it to the extremly predictable ending by sheer stubborn will, but I won't be looking for this author's books again 
 I can't believe how many people think this movie is a masterpiece. I had such high expectations of it and was extremely disappointed. When the film began I was interested for about 20 minutes, but then as it went on I started to have doubts. After a while I was debating whether or not to turn it off, but towards the end I decided to leave it on just to see how bad it was actually going to get. And it really did get bad! The ending was so predictible and hackneyed. It was just another crappy cops and robbers story, but with a high budget and an all-star cast 
 Investment Banker with a conscience, Ben Hartman, and special agent Anna Navaro's plot lines and bodies soon become intertwined in their quest for the secrets of Sigma, an elite cabal with roots in Nazi Germany that is bent on world domination. What starts out as reasonable and entrancing enough genre pulp becomes sheer Bond by the end, but there's no denying Ludlum has a gift for keeping the heat turned up from page to page.  If you are new to espionage fiction and have even slightly literary sensibilities, run don't walk to writers like Alan Furst, Graham Greene, or even John Le Carré. But if strong characters aren't a necessity, you are able to suspend your disbelief, and you are lusting for pure literary sugar, you probably won't be disappointed.  Ludlum is a great author for those who typically spend hours in front of the television and tremble in anticipation at the release of the next Hollywood blockbuster, because he provides essentially the same experience in written form.  He is a master of the wildly oscillating plot line, but barely approaches apprentice status in any other literary area.  I found myself cringing in embarrassment for the author at many points, but to his credit I was compelled to continue turning the pages until I had reached the end.  It's like candy, you can't stop eating it but feel ill once it's gone.  If you are a die hard Ludlumite I admit this is my first foray.  Please point me to a better example of his work if one exists, otherwise I'll invest my time elsewhere and catch up on Mr. Ludlum by proxy when the next "Bourne" film comes out 
 When I received this book in the mail, I was shocked at how cheaply it had been printed. Anyone familiar with the cheap cardboard backed books put out by another catholic publishing house that I won't mention, will recognize the similiar handiwork here. The paper is of the poorest quality, the binding is destined to crack with little use, etc. This is hardly worth the [money] charged. The two week cycle of prayer used here will quickly become monotonous to most diligent practitioners of regular prayer. If you are serious about starting the Hours, invest in Phyllis Tickle's "Divine Hours" here at Amazon 
 A friend of mine gave me Bad Love to read when I spent the night at his house and was looking for a book.  I started it, and took it home with me.  After almost finishing it, I called him and said I really didn't like it, at which point he started laughing and told me both he and his wife thought it was horrible, and they gave it to me as a gag!  They couldn't beleive I got as far as I did.  I like fiction, and even meaningless pop-fiction like Patterson, Stephen King, Grisham, etc., so I'm not some elitist.  With that as a background,  Bad Love is without a doubt the worst work I have ever read.  I am shocked that people have given this garbage 5 stars.  Its poorly written, has a bad plot, and....you know what....its not even worth going on.  I am only writing to warn others.  Avoid at all costs.  You would be better off shaving your head with a cheese grater than putting yourself through Bad Love.  
 My wife is a big fan of Candice. She has done some large remodeling projects on our homes over the years and isn't exactly a novice on these types of things.  I thought this would be a no brainer as far as scoring "hubby" points and bought her the book.  Big mistake,  while I didn't read it I was told by the wife that this was nothing more than worked over material from previous shows with a few tid bits thrown in to spice things up.  She did say that there was a bit of interesting background on Candice but reading the book in general was a disappointment and waste of time to say the least.  Bummer I say! 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 I know, I know - Elaine Stritch is a "legend" - she makes sure you know it, believe me...  Maybe I'm the only one in the universe who felt like smacking her, but, I felt like smacking her.  She offers a few bon mots about Old Hollywood and Broadway, however the rest seems like a self-congratulatory vanity piece.  I got the feeling that she's been practicing these "naked" little soliloquies for her audience of one, in front of the mirror, for years. Maybe that is the point of the show, I don't know.  Perhaps some think she should be humored because she's 80, but crikey, I just found most of it insufferable.  Sorry Elaine.. 
 This book is beautfully illustrated.  And that is the only good thing I have to say about it.  It is a terribly negative book. Everything is "don't do this, don't do that!"  Babies like to splash in the bathtub, and it is joyful to watch them play, but in this book the baby is told not to splash in the tub.  Ditto for stopping to smell the flowers: "Don't be so slow, baby!"   My toddler loves looking at the pictures in this book and saying "please, baby, please", but we have changed the tone entirely, and most of the words so that this book is not negative and unpleasant 
 The clip holds the money, but the credit card holder is a bit scary.  It just doesn't work that well.  Plus, it is very heavy.  If you put 5 bills in there, even without the credit cards, this thing is like putting a brick in your pocket.  I would not recommend it 
 I purchased the Alex Watch for my 8 year old daughter as a gift from Santa.  The watch face has a small round purple piece that sits in the center of the wathch face where the small and long hands are positioned.  This piece came loose and is floating around the watch and jamming the hands.  So, the watch hands cannot move forward.  Frustrating and useless, since I cannot return it 
 I, too, could just not finish this book. It felt like such a shame because the idea behind, and the title, and even the first pages had me really looking forward to the story. But three-quarters of the way though I'd just had enough. I found the writing style very ponderous. The switching tenses were confusing, the book is mostly written in the present tense which just doesn't work for this kind of writing.   My biggest criticism is of the cloying, sentimental prose that infused the whole piece (or, certainly, as far as I read). Moreover, as another reviewer mentioned, this author never gave her audience any reason to enjoy her characters. It is all "tell" and no "show". Everything is assumed. I never got any sense of why this Annie was so beloved, which is the entire premise for the book! And the five main characters were simply irritating. The author seemed to want her readers to fall in love with these women, to look to them as models to which they might mould their own lives. But there was no rational as to why these women were so fabulous, or why any self-respecting woman might consider their characters admirable or aspirational.   For me, this is the worst kind of "womens" writing: sentimental, superficial schlock. Ultimately it was just not worth the time or effort expended in reading. Don't bother 
 This book aimed to sell on its claim to fame which hinged upon the juicy account of the lives of 9 femme fatale who purportedly launched the careers many great men in history. This book sucked precisely because these "juicy" accounts teetered toward tacky sensationalism; the writing no more refined than tabloid-style prose; and the manner in which the author attempted to connect the unconnected lives in a bid to justify the publication of the title was incoherent and done in poor taste. The book is an eye sore and an abomination...avoid it at all cost 
 So lets see if this makes sense:  -Mormons are forcibly expelled by Missouri Militia (Gov. Boggs infamous "Extermination Order") in 1838; -They are again expelled by Illinois Militia in 1846 after Joseph Smith is murdered in State custody; -They flee to the desert wastes of the Great Basin where no one else wants to settle--they struggle against starvation to survive; -Republican John C. Fremont (notable for killing Indian women/children with his sabre to save gunpowder) runs for President in 1856 on a platform to abolish "the twin relics of barbarism", namely slavery and polygamy; -Southern Democrat James Buchanan is elected President in 1856--he won't do anything about slavery; -But Buchanan pre-empts the Republican's religious bigotry platform by acting on bogus reports of a "Mormon Rebellion" to send the "Utah Expedition" to "quell" the insurrection; -Utah Territorial Governor Brigham Young--fearing (with just cause) the worst--orders what turns out to be a bloodless defense by Mormon Raiders, who force Johnston's Army to winter in Ft. Bridger, Wyoming; -This delay permits cooler heads in Washington/Salt Lake City to avoid open war in 1858; -This in the context that newspapers in California and elsewhere had long advocated a "final solution" to the "Mormon Problem"; better to kill them than to tolerate them; -Since the Mormons had been driven from state to state because of religious intolerance, why would they have reason to trust the good graces of Pres. Buchanan and a beligerent/hostile Federal Army marching on Utah?    Author Will Bagley briefly mentions most of the above historical facts and acknowledges that Gov. Young had "virtually no military or political weapons to resist federal authority...".  But his entire book is spent minimalizing the ordeals of the Mormons--even insinuating they deserved to be driven--in order to slander Gov. Young with a supposed "crime of power".  In a nutshell, Bagley picks up the prosecutor's mantle of Cradlebaugh, Carlton and Baskin in their rigorous but dead-end attempts to "Pin the Tale on Brigham".  Those bigots couldn't produce evidence to indict Brigham Young then despite the full power and funding of the U.S. Government/Army behind them, and Bagley certainly fails to produce evidence to indict Brigham Young now.    For example, Bagley's "smoking gun"--the journal of Dimick Huntington--speaks vaguely of Gov. Young's "giving" the cattle of emigrants on the road south to the Piutes, but fails to mention that none of the Indians present at that event were anywhere near Mountain Meadows until after the atrocity was consumated.  The Piutes who did participate knew nothing of this purported deal.  You'd expect such sham evidence from the likes of Barney Fife, not a serious or unbiased historian.     Further, Bagley presumes to channel Gov. Young's thoughts regarding the Mormon's September, 1857 "war strategy" against the hostile U.S. Government/Army.  Bagley speculates that Gov. Young ordered the massacre of the Fancher train to in some way intimidate the U.S. Government by closing the overland trails and "violating" his oath of office.  This is utterly preposterous--especially in the context of a hostile Army marching on Utah.  Obviously, Bagley believes Gov. Young to be either exceptionally stupid/obtuse or perhaps "Jim Jones" suicidal to deliberately give Pres. Buchanan and the Army the very pretext/incident they needed to justify the elimination of the "Mormon Problem" once and for all.  Bagley acknowledges that Gov. Young was a "fox"--a very shrewd operator--another Bagley contradiction.  If Bagley is so biased to believe such tortured logic, perhaps he also can conjure the tunnel-vision necessary to believe in the tooth fairy.        Bagley's research for the most part is detailed--if not tedious--though he should better acknowledge the tabloid nature of most of his sources.  He often quotes tabloid rather than primary sources.  His prose is pointedly inflamatory against Brigham Young and the Mormons; they are "fanatics" who are "oblivious" to the rancor the practice of their religion has on non-Mormons--as if this is license/justification to send mobs/militias/Armies to persecute, prosecute, and drive an entire religious movement.  Hasn't Bagley heard of the First Amendment?  Pres. Buchanan sure acted like he didn't...  Bagley's conclusions and analysis are preposterous--particularly the tortured parsing of Gov. Young's straight-forward order to Haight/Iron County to leave the wagon train alone.  ("Depends on what the meaning of 'is' is", right, Mr. Bagley?)    Bagley's caricature of Mormon society as not being capable of doing anything with or without direction from Brigham Young is also groteque, insulting and utterly false.  I defy anyone anywhere to show where in the Book of Mormon the Indians are referred to  as the "Battle-axe Of The Lord".  Bagley works all the tired Mormon sterotypes possible to rationalize his bias.  Bagley insists he uses logic to put together the puzzle of Mountain Meadows.  He sez Gov. Young/Apostle Smith contributed to the tinderbox creating the conditions for the Massacre.  In the context of looming war, I agree because Young/Smith had every reason to believe they were about to be attacked/driven/exterminated by the US Army.  While trying to pin contextual blame on Young/Smith, Bagley brazenly fails to acknowledge the "elephant in the tent": Pres. Buchanan and the US Army.  This Massacre would absolutely not have happened had it not been for the bigoted and reckless warmongering by Pres. Buchanan to send the Army to Utah, regardless of the murder of Parley P. Pratt.  If Bagley wants to apportion blame on Young/Smith and is so insistant on an apology/repentance of the contemporary LDS Church, why doesn't he also demand the same of Pres. Buchanan's successors, the U.S. Army, and the descendents of the corrupt Federal appointees who clearly harrassed the Saints?  If he is so convinced of the benign behavior of the Fancher party who stampeded Utah with their very large (and presumably hungry) cattle herd (remember Utah is a desert with little grass, unlike Arkansas), why can't he give a scintilla of benefit-of-the-doubt to Gov. Young and the Mormons?  Clearly, Bagley is pandering to those Mormon haters whose mind is already made up and can't be confused with fact.  The bottom line is this: Southern Utah Mormons got caught up in the war hysteria caused by the outrageously unwarranted march of the US Army, feared that once again they as a people would be driven, over-reacted to an emigrant party that was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and commited a horrible atrocity.  Much to the chagrin of the Mormon haters, the act was local.  Perhaps for Bagley's sake, Mark Hoffman can "discover" a document that could really indict Gov. Young...    As the great-nephew of Juanita Brooks, Bagley's presuming to carry on the truthful inquiry she initiated is a farce.  Brooks did not have an axe to grind, as Bagley obviously does.  Perhaps Bagley would do better to try his hand at writing comic books.   
 "I have received your new book against the human race, and thank you for it. Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. One longs, in reading your book, to walk on all fours. But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it. Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves." Voltaire (1755 
 Boring!! I was disappointed.  In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book.  That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around.  I just could not do it with this book 
 This is great looking watch at a good price but very heavy.  I am unable to wear this watch with activities like golf and tennis. 
 I purchased this for my laptop. It worked great at first. There were blue and red lights that would brighten up when it was awake. Not anymore. The blue light completely stopped working. It used to be plug and play. Not anymore. Basically it is useless. It just doesn't work. It was used probably 30 times at the most. Complete junk. I like the smallness and shape of it though. Time to try a different brand 
 Unfortunately he doesn't go into detail on the Bradley method, rather focuses on how great his method is and how horrible other methods are. It may be a great way to give birth but there isn't enough info in this book to tell 
 The DVD is really a deception. All the experts invited are the ones that support Gnostic theory. I was hoping that I can see a balanced view related to this subject. Instead, I only see the point of view of the pro Dan Brown's experts. I think we should invite the famous evangelists, theologists, and scholars from the protestant, cathodic and liberal to discuss the issue. The DVD does not even discuss why the Gnostic theory was rejected in the first century. 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.  Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?  The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend 
 I really enjoyed Kelly Wearstler's Modern Glamour, but found this book to be disappointing.  There's no text, only seemingly self-serving photographs of her and her gowns in her over-designed house.  The only thought I had while flipping through the pages was how difficult it must be to keep it dusted!  I would have been much more satisfied were there some explanations as to how she might have come to some of her design conclusions, because to me it all seems cluttered and complicated, and somewhat random.  I guess that's part of the appeal, but I expected more text and fewer images of the woman herself.  One quick flip through this one is enough - borrow it from the library 
 First time I write a review, but I thought I would take the bother. I did not like this book. Although the title is accurate, it is about conversations with millionares, the conversations are not very enriching. I would have prefered to have spent my money on something else.     BE WARNED!!! In the book there is a web page address were two free gift are promised, this is not true a you are requested to sign up with your e-mail, only to be bombarded with SPAM, and end up with no gift 
 After one month I have never received the item. Never even received a shipping confirmation. So am extremely dissappointed in the seller you adevertise. The other DVD came just fine I ordered from another seller. So sorry can't honestly rate the item when it was never sent. I've been very patient waiting for it to come and extremely busy so haven't had a chance to write before  Mark Cai 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 I was looking for a book that would give me some great recipes to use with my new food processor.  I was not happy with this one. There aren't a whole lot of recipes and a lot of the ingredients are not very common in our household.  I usually have capers, anchovy paste, greek olive etc. So I am not talking ketchup and mustard here.  I am talking about tahini, lemon grass, and indian relish (what is that, and where do you get it?)  I enjoy cooking for my family, but I am more apt to use recipes with ingredients I will use for other recipes.  In addition, a lot of the recipes are very complex, which is okay, but cooking doesn't have to be complex to be either gourmet, or tastey.  There are a couple of recipes I will try:  Mushroom caviar, Oh-my-God Cheesecake and Stuffed Artichokes.  Other recipes I will probably never do are: Sweet Potato Soup w/ coconut milk, lemongrass & cilantro, Terrine of Pork & Ham w/ Calvados & Juniper Berries, Leek & Sweet Red Pepper flan, Chicken Liver & Red Onion Jam. I also ordered The Food Processor Bible.  There are many more recipes that aren't so elaborate and more for daily use 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon "chloroform in print" and he wasn't kidding.  It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it's worth a shot).    Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a "glass looker" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use "magic stones" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found "gold plates" and used what he called the "Urim and Thum" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).    There are SO many myths that are told by members of the church "most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband...  11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what's up with that???).. etc.. and the list goes on and on...  I am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great! Just PLEASE do some homework first and don't just rely on the "power of prayer".  There is a reason that Utah is the [...] capital of the USA (I'm sure every one of those people "prayed" about that big business decision - it can OFTEN be mis-intrepreted).  
 I am a huge fan of Kinky Friedman's books, but was very disappointed with this one.  It's the first book he's written that I actually didn't finish, it's just too introspective and frankly not Kinky's usual style.  I expected to be entertained but was just bored.  I hope Kinky's next book will be back to his normal craziness 
 The text gets 5 stars for the orientation, organization, and the on-line resources for the text. It describes exactly what you would want in an Applied Corporate Finance course. Unfortunately, I have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which I specifically want my students not to make. This has been frustrating for my students, as well as myself. However, I am confident that when this problem is cleaned up, the book will be among the best Applied Corporate Finance text in the market. I strongly recommend a new, corrected edition 
 I was very excited to see another Valentine horror movie coming out; the last one I remember was My Bloody Valentine about some Cole Minor named Harry Nabob or something like that, very bad film.  But Valentine looked like it would be good and it was actually until the ending.   The pretty boy being the killer again is just played out.  Scream was good everything else is just redundant.  Imagine if the geeky boy who was attacked by the bullies actually got burned or his face was horribly deformed in a fall or something like that.  He goes to the mental institution and years later he escapes or is released into society, but escaped is much better.  This masked figure then chases down the mean kids and kills them one by one, then the climax when we see his face it shows the reason he is so angry and deranged.   I give it 2 stars because it could have been so good and I can always pretend the ending was good 
 HORRIBLE! The dialogue is extra stupid and corny and the storyline extra empty and the cussing extra filthy..I have read all the UNDEAD books but this is the worst..I think MaryJanice wrote this one on the can~ 
 This book sucks so bad.  All of the redundant crap that everyone makes  kids read about the Holocaust is so depressing.  We all understand that  WWII was a terrible thing and that the Axis forces did hideous things to  Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, etc.  Do we have to keep reading about  it?  I feel like my brain has been drained!  It's all so depressing, so  negative.  Move on, people.  I might sound insensitive...sure, this was an  atrocious thing and deeply affected those involved, but move on.  My priest  says that we bear our own crosses.  The Holocaust is NOT going on now.  We  need to learn from what happened (I have!) and MOVE ON 
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed. 
 It was a book required for my MBA course, but it speaks to what seems like common sense.  Read the Wall Street Journal if you want some insight on real world strategy 
 Just another wanna be somebody, using the tired old trodge stuff. Like a previous bright lad said, `Heresay`. Wonder why they don`t consider self immolation to get attention....now THAT would be worth reading about. AND we could bring chestnuts. As for George nicking somebody elses song....oh dear. And of course, the only place that the Beatles went, was america. Typical yank author..two places in the world. america and notamerica. Toilet paper might work if the ink isn`t as cheap as the scribbler. Not worth a zac.  BTW the software advised that I HAD to award this crud with at least one star or the review would not get posted...hence the one star where I gave it minus 5 stars (idea would be to give us a choice of bouquets or brickbats doncha think??) 
 A favourite writer goes to prison, keeps a diary which proves to be an enjoyable read, then, upon his release, writes the worst book of his career. The concept of the book is good, as is the idea to blend the characters into the 9-11 tragedy. The first 20 pages flow with typical Archer style. Then the characters begin to make a series of continuously irrational decisions.  My personnal favourite is when 2 characters independantly consider driving either to Canada or Mexico in order to fly to Europe during the 9-11 grounding of air traffic. The idea that New Yorkers wouldn't know that Montreal is the nearest international airport seem laughable. While there is a direct highway to Montreal, Archer sends the main character to Toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes, is in the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive. Once at the border, the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art historian who apparantly doesn't know that McGill University is in Montreal not Toronto as is claimed by our hero. The guard then remarks that he will "meet" a collegue of the hero when that peron travels up to the conference. The idea that only one border guard is working the dozens of eastern US/Canadian border crossings, with multi-lane checkpoints 24/7 is simply the work of a mind out of touch with reality.  Its fine to change details to enhance the plot and structure of a story, but there is simply no benefit to this sillyness.  Dan Cormie 
 I think that most of these guides were written by British people.  Coincidentally, they are pretty objective until you get to this one.  Since the Brits consider themselves to be brutally honest, I was hoping that the authors would mention ALCOHOL under the 'Obsessions' chapter.  Hardly. 'The Pub' is described as a social setting when it should be described as a social ill.  The 'Character' chapter starts off with, "Moderation means a lot to the English".  That in itself is laughable.  This book is obviously about England before dark.  After dark, it's a whole different country, and the authors are truly in denial 
 I saw the FIERY FURNACES open up for WILCO last year at Radio City Music Hall, NY last year.  A high school talent show would have been more entertaining.  Absolute noodling rubbish.  The sounded like bad seventies GENESIS, heavy metal, and SUN RA all combined.  Oh yeah, the sound sucked too.  I understand pushing the boundaries and experimenting but, come on.  A hint of melody might be a thought.  The only thing going for them is the very beautiful singer.  
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 Had it not been for Nora Robert's contribution to this book, I would have rated it with no stars.  The Eve Dallas story was great as usual, however the rest of the short stories were awful.  I always read what I start but in this case I should have changed that rule.  Just awful!! 
 Don't pay money to see this. Wood Harris is not a bad actor; quite the antithesis. He made a heroic effort to portray a man whose persona, mannerisms, and "vibe" simply cannot be immitated. Kudos to Mr. Harris for his bravery. The director did a mediocre job bringing life to a badly written script. Granted, Hendrix' story had a great deal of tragedy; but I have it on good authority that Hendrix was also a lot of fun to be around.  The scene that described his death was not historicaly accurate: and I know people who were personally aquainted with Hendrix and were around when he died: and they told me what REALLY happened that day. The music was marred by the fact that nobody can play the guitar like Hendrix without sounding like someone trying to immitate him, and Hendrix' estate refused to allow them to use any of his original compositions. The glossing over of the music; which was Hendrix' greatest accomplishment, was truly irritating. All it was was sensationalism and Hollywood glamor: all flash and no substance - which does a great disservice to Hendrix' legacy, musical genius, and life. The whole thing made me sick. 
 This is a nice book. I say nice because it does tell you what to do but not how to do it! There are some parts where I was completely stumped, so I bought the book. It still didn't help me so I am going to buy the other one  and see how it is 
 my other management textbooks were able to cover nearly the same amount of information in 1/4 the space without being needlessly complex or as paralizingly boring. it would be an excellent cure for insomnia. professors PLEASE don't make anyone buy this thing. 
 Avid fans of Sidney Sheldon will probably enjoy this book.  It is indeed as is noted in the editorial reviews a rough-hewn and crudely carved sequel of "The Other Side of Midnight."  Sheldon does not deviate from the routine trashy forumla replete with cliche bedroom scenes and a plethora of ruthless characters.    Set in the late 1940s right after WWII, Catherine, wife of pilot Larry whom readers first encountered in "The Other Side of Midnight" regains her memory.  She remembers how cruel Larry was to her and how he jilted her for his mistress, Noelle Page.  Indeed, Noelle was the kept mistress of one Constantin Demiris who was written to sound like an ersatz Ari Onasis.  Demiris, like a magician can make those in his disfavor disappear.  Exit Larry and Noelle in the first installment.  In this book, Catherine, the long-lost heroine is restored to glory and is swept off her feet by a man who is loosely based on the cliche Cavalry men.    A psychiatrist and an eclectic mix of patients are thrown into this story; just how they are directly tied into the main plot has never been addressed.  One character who is clearly written as an autistic savant displays some of the more prominent autistic behaviors.  He is echolalic; he recites long chains of information and he knows the number and type of vehicles he passes in route to the doctor's office.  His activities are solitary and few; he does not voluntarily interact with others.  I am really tired of stories like this that portray characters with autism as automaton-like savants with isolated abilities that are far removed from the social world.  I think stories like this do a grave disservice to those with autism and for others who come across autistic characters because it is just perpetuating a stereotype.  This book does not really contain much of a mystery.  It's just ruthless people getting even with each other.  Even good old Demiris' wife Melina enters this story after having been relegated to shadow figure status in the original.  Same old fare.  An attorney who was directly involved in a trial engineered by Demiris re-enters the picture.  Some fancy manuevering, and he runs away with the show.  Literally 
 In 1993, Record, a former Senate Armed Services Committee staff member, authored Hollow Victory: A Contrary View of the Gulf War[1] in which he took President George H.W. Bush to task for not ousting Saddam Hussein. In the present book, Record takes George W. Bush to task for having corrected his father's mistake.  The new book, while well written, is reduced by the author's permeating antipathy for so-called neoconservatives, alleging without proof that a sympathy for Israel's Likud Party colors their view of the world. While it is true that neoconservatives tend to be staunch supporters of Israel, every president since Harry Truman has defended Israel's right to exist and to defend itself. Nor is there anything new about U.S. support for democracy or opposition to terror. The only recent development is a willingness of the U.S. government to reach out to new partners, even if this means working without traditional allies. Record further blames neoconservatives for "the president's controversial use-of-force doctrine," curiously overlooking the impact of 9/11 on Bush's thinking.  Record holds neoconservatives responsible for pursuing policies that cause many adversaries to dislike the United States. He laments "the Bush administration's foreign policy fails to grasp the fact that others do not see us as we see ourselves-that is, as a benign and historically exceptional force." But the Bush administration does grasp this; it just believes that being respected is more important than being liked. The costs of winning Syrian, North Korean, or Chinese favor for U.S. policy would be too high if it meant abandonment of democracies such as Israel, South Korea, and Taiwan. Conversely, Libyan strongman Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi may not like the United States, but it was his respect for the Bush administration's willingness to back force with military action that led to his decision to abandon his nuclear ambitions.  Record's style is confident and authoritative with plenty of facts cited and examples given. A close read, though, shows that Record ignores facts that undermine his arguments. For example, he trumpets a 1999 UNICEF report that relied on Iraqi government statistics to conclude that sanctions on Iraq killed 500,000 Iraqi children; he ignores a joint Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization study the following year that found that half the Iraqi population was overweight, and that hypertension and diabetes-not diseases of the hungry-were among the leading causes of Iraqi mortality.[2] Other facts he simply gets wrong. How could the Defense Department have airlifted Ahmad Chalabi into Iraq during military operations when Chalabi had returned to Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq months before the war began?  Dark Victory has many other weaknesses. Record engages in one-man's-terrorist-is-another's-patriot moral relativism. He conflates the Afghan mujahideen with Al-Qaeda, an anachronism that ignores a decade-long fight between Al-Qaeda pan-Islamists and Afghan nationalists such as Ahmad Shah Masud. While determined to debunk any analogy between postwar Japan and Iraq, Record ignores the South Korea example, frequently cited by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. Notably absent from a book about Iraq is any consideration of what Iraqis think; Record writes as if Iraqis do not exist.  A book should be more than a glorified op-ed. Unfortunately, Dark Victory is not.  Middle East Quarterly, Spring 200 
 I don't like the index in the front of the book. The headings of the units that the book is organized into are kind of cryptic. It's hard to find what you are looking for. Some of the monologue selections would be poor choices for contest or auditions. They wouldn't appeal to every kind of judge or director. There still are some great pieces though, so I had to give it 2 stars 
 I have been a trainer for many years, and am currently working towards becoming a behaviorist - and I can tell you that Paul Owens offers nothing new to the world of dog training. This book is an average (at best) compilation of training techniques discovered and perfected by other (professional) dog trainers/behaviorists. I've read many, many books on dog training and behavior and this is one not worth purchasing. If you're looking for an interesting read to learn more about how dogs think and why they act the way they do - check out any of Stanley Coren's books (he has many). If you're looking for training techniques - take a class. Honestly, there is nothing better for a dog than to go to puppy classes (with a respectable and knowledgable trainer) where they can be properly socialized and trained. If your dog is having serious behavior issues - consult a professional animal behaviorist. Your veterinarian should be able to refer you to somebody. Good luck! 
 A complete waste of money.  I still have all my stretch mark 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
  Lorna is pretty, and her suitor is devoted. The story holds your attention. For many that is enough. Some auspicious beginnings, without depth. So maybe 3-stars for some people. I give 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again in later years.   I found the romance unfulfilling, and so the movie. Romance movies that I liked better are: "North & South", "Pride & Prejudice"-1940, & 1996 & 2006, "Wives and Daughters", and "A Walk to Remember". Adventure with romance: "The Scarlet Pimpernel". 
 I've read all of this author's books and this one was just plain bad, dumb, and stupid.  I tried to read the next in the series but knew it wasn't going to get any better.  I generally enjoy these stories but this one was very tiresome and idiotic.   Save your money for something better 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 Glad to see I'm not the only one who can't stand this book.  There is nothing to redeem the inferior writing, fractured plot, inconsitancies (a dragon changed color!  OMG, hire an editor, for crimminy's sake!), and completely undeveloped characters.  Weyerleaders act like petulant children, showing the worst characterists of previous "real" McCaffery characters.  The main character is alternately distrusted, then suddenly trusted, then shot at, then trusted again, for little apparent reason.  And firestone plain old does not kill dragons--ask a real writer, Todd.  You stink 
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 Well it was an obvious path to musical collapse, she should have stopped at Tidal.  If I'd been dating her for the talent she showed on her first CD I would have broken up with her over this piece of haggis.  The course of the last three CD's drew a trendline right from stardom into a melodic pit.  The lyrics on Extraordinary Machine were not only not up to their namesake but worse than the melodies.  The number of great reviews on this site only go to prove once again the masses prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive.  Her original Cd with it's collection of diminished and augmented chords set to deep overlays of texturing, blended with truly poetic lyrics has been replaced with a distilled musical joke.  What on earth gave her the impetus to try to go 'artsy' by experimenting with music predating the second world war I'll never know.  It's obvious her angst is no longer producing art, rather it is being replaced with contrived resolution and the equivalent of a musical epitaph.    Eat it up people, it's all about not having to think.  It's the kind of tripe that happens when someone is trying to hard to think of how to outdo their first brush stroke of genius and is confronted with musical block.  Judging by the news her father is ruining her life and creativity as so often is the case in todays less than feminine half of the culture.   
 I mean no disrespect to a prior reviewer--Jill Switzer--or to anyone for that matter.  But I do resent having been enticed to buy this book.    Ms Switzer expresses 'enormous gratitude' for the advice given in this book, which has led to a book deal. She wrote the review in July 2004--her only one--when she was 'putting the spit and polish on her manuscript.'  I searched Amazon for her book but apparently it's not published yet, or Amazon hasn't yet begun selling it.  Please look for Ms Switzer's book to check the authenticity of her review.    Another disquieting piece of advice in the book was the suggestion that the writer employ an indexing specialist.  MS_Word does a pretty good job of indexing--am I wrong?   The book does not give sound advice regarding what to do when a publishing house tries not to pay a writer (usually first time writers will need to field such a 'try on'.)  I remember it saying that under no circumstances should you bother the Editor of the Publishing House regarding money matters.    Overall, this book felt like it was designed for 'wannabees' who would never be.    Strange also, that this book, like so many others that seem to pander to the interests of the Publishers, won't state expected income in dollar terms for things like romance novels.    Thank God for Amazon's new 'real name' system--now I can read reviews with some certitude of genuineness.  
 ridicolous creatureattaks a bar full of strange characters.it starts out pretty good whith the introductions of the characters but goes own hill fast when it bings nothing new just more gore.Krista allen however is always great to look at and she does not dissapoint in feast eighter,if only there was more of her to look at,that would have helped the movie a lot.ps does any one else think baltazar ghetty is a illigitamate son of martin sheen.Because he looks like two drops of water like charlie sheen in everything he does 
 Honestly, this is a book you don't need. Torts are not that difficult and this text is not the best aid for a student. While it comprehensive on the subject, you'd be better served to supplement your casebook with a guide like an Emanuel or Gilberts. Because Torts are not that complex, the brevity and structure of those two will probablely better serve you when it comes time for the final. Furthermore, the Emmanuel's has two additions and tries to match sections to your casebook. While in general it is a fine book, if I were a student, I would go another route 
 The story started off OK with the first two short chapters.  Then it falls apart.  The template is used but isn't filled out.  The love interest isn't, the bad guys did it but we don't have a clue how the good guys know that.  Getting into the clutches of the bad guys was done by following the script from the (imaginary) Scary Movie series for action fiction.  Getting out of the clutches of the bad guys relied entirely on the stupidity of well-trained mercenaries (who could not have been trained to the level of Scoobie Do if they were really that stupid).  There were a few interesting tidbits on history and historical paraphenalia, glaciers, old planes but the biology was 70's.  A very disappointing read 
 This item was never received. Amazon's tracking system claims that it was shipped on January 20 by Canada Post. 
 This is my first book by this author, and I honestly feel like I might like the story after-the-fact, if the author didn't ruin all the punchlines in the book. The fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like I was being beat over the head with a "Did you get it?" stick. I also thought he was over-doing the fairytale theme, with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 This author obviously has a political and religious agenda. For anyone today to seriously believe that anyone than Muslim Arab terrorists perpetrated the most heinous terrorist incident in history is just moronic. His "proofs" are all worthless inuendo, and remind me of some of the nonsense I read on snopes.com. It's pretty amazing what some people will believe. For those reviewers who think this book is important, let alone factual, I've got this great bridge to sell you...  Don't waste your cash on this trash 
 I would like to write a favorable review of this book, but I honestly can't.  You see, I am a Nebraskan and my father knew the Sandoz family growing up in western Nebraska. However, this is a hard book to read and at times, as dull and lifeless as the Nebraska prarie that Ms Sandoz describes.  For someone looking to learn more about western Nebraska during the late 1800's to early 1900's I suggest picking up a Willa Cather novel 
 This is, without a doubt, one of the worst "films" that I have ever witnessed.  The plot, if one can call it that, revolves around that parodying summer camp movies from the late 70's and early 80's would be hilarious.  And 21 years after they were made!  Or, was it an attempt to make a deliberately bad film, and label it "ironic"?  Either way, the film has some of the most indifferent, atrocious acting you're ever likely to see.  Janeane Garofalo (who needs to stop associating herself with David Wain and Michael Showalter, the creators of this "film" and the awful TV series, Stella) looks like she rather be anywhere else, David Hyde Pierce looks like he wants to strangle his agent for giving him this script, and you will be lucky to chuckle twice in the entire film.  In the featurette, the directors Michael Showalter and David Wain, say they were drunk during most of the shoot, and it shows.  Indifferent performances, horrible direction, continuity errors (like visible tape marks on the floor, hair styles changing in the same shot), and an appalling lack of professionalism sink this film early and it never recovers.  There is nothing good about his film, other than it ends.  It amazes me that people out there could actually like this film, AND give it five star reviews.  For the rest of you out there, do not waste 97 minutes of your time.    
 ABC dives into the Kennedy killing with this video showing how the lone-nut Oswald did the killing alone, just as the Warren Commission said he did.  The main focus of the video seems to be to show why all of the conspiracy-theory people are mistaken and misled.  Unfortunately, the content is sufficiently weak that the video's ability to persuade will be limited to those who are completely unfamiliar with the facts.  It's easy to believe in the lone-nut theory of the killing as long as you believe things like:  1) the Parkland Hospital doctors in the ER who had seen many bullet wounds were mistaken about seeing an entry wound on the front of Kennedy's neck, an exit wound on the back of his head, and the absence of the grotesque wound on the right side of Kennedy's head seen on the Zapruder film, 2) the autopsy accurately identified the type and location of Kennedy's wounds, 3) the second bullet fired by lone-nut Oswald passed through Kennedy's body, through Connally's body, and lodged in Connally's leg, later to fall out on the stretcher in good condition and morph from the pointed shape identified by the finder to the rounded shape found by the Warren Commission, 4) the eyewitnesses and police at the scene when the shooting occurred were mistaken about the number of shots they heard, hearing shots originate from the grassy knoll, and seeing the limousine momentarily stop, 5) Oswald fired three shots with a bolt-action rifle in 6 seconds and was able to fire down at a target moving away from him and up an incline while hitting with two shots, 6) Oswald decided not to fire when the Kennedy limousine was coming towards him but waited until after it had made the turn directly in front of him, had traveled several hundred yards, and was moving away, 7) Oswald was able to hide his rifle and race down the stairs from the 6th floor to the 2nd floor lunchroom in 90 seconds without even breathing hard and then be questioned and released by an extremely suspicious police officer who had just raced into the building after hearing the shots, 8) fire a bolt-action rifle 3 times without having any gunsmoke residue on his cheek to be detected by a 'paraffin' test given hours later by the Dallas PD, and 9) a guy just happened to be pumping an opened umbrella up and down on a sunny day at the exact spot of the shooting, when the president came driving by.    If none of these things are a stretch, then you will find ABC's work highly persuasive.  Otherwise, you will start to wonder why ABC is cranking out this kind of stuff and...perhaps...even become a conspiracy nut.  Even if you do lean towards the conspiracy point of view, though, you will find this video well-produced and interesting.  
 As a freshman in university, I thought this would be a funny novel, but I was completely wrong.  This is one of the most horrible books I have ever read; so bad in fact, that I was tempted to use it as toilet paper after 20  pages in to it.  But I read it all, and was bored and regretful that I had  bought it by the time I finished 
 I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large.. 
 The diagrams in the book where nice, but man this guy isn't an author. You can tell he knows what he is talking about but he just uses a lot of lingo. Thankfully, there is a glossary, but it takes too long to look up every word. He just tells you the different parts in mechanisms. He doesn't really explain how anything works. By the way, he has like 5 nicknames for every part. If you are a beginner too complex, if your an expert you probably know this stuff. If you have the money and your an amateur go ahead. If none of the above I wouldn't suggest this book 
 Every Pinon Press book has a title page with a money back guarantee coupon and information.  This is a lie.  When you send them the information and title page...they send the envelope back "Return to Sender."  There is no listed contact information for the company...just in case you ever feel like giving them feedback.  -Or asking them why they lie 
 With regard to concerns about the audio quality of the this MP3 version, the original audio CD version ("The Collector's Edition"), an 8-CD set, is still available from Amazon UK. I paid a little more than twice the MP3 price. The ISBN number of the Audio CD version is 0-563-47702-4 
 I really didn't read it as it is too long and does not keep my interest at all.  I have read other books in the past like "Body for Life" and found them very informative and short and to the point.  
 Although there is much informative basic material in this book, I cannot stand the fuzzy math this author uses.  The percentage gains he reports in some of his examples are blatantly deceptive.  An example is Fig. 5-10, where he shows the possible gains achievable using the "gap" method.  He quotes a profit potential of $21062, which I dont dispute.  However, there is no mention of the actual money necessary to make the trades shown, which is probably somewhere around $30,000 (minimum).  This would yield a profit of around 67%.  The figure, however, quotes a profit return of almost 700%!!  Whether or not these figures are his, or if he borrowed them from another source does not matter.  He should know better!  This sort of misleading "fluff" does nothing but confuse the amatuer and leads to the expectation of gains much better than realistically possible with a small account balance.  Throughout the book, math like this is used to over exagerate possible gains from day trading 
 I saw all the revies for this movie and was expecting a dark enjoyable tale about a libtertine.  I was strongly mistaken.  Johnny Depp is a great actor with great abilites, but this is the worst movie of his I have ever seen.  Even his "cheesy" movies were better than this.  The rated R rating is light.  I couldn't believe how pornographic it was.  Even in Quills, it wasn't as raunchy as this.  Don't waste your money or your time with this one 
 These dried cherries are more like candy than dried fruit.  I was expecting a chewy, tart treat and got an instant sugar high instead.  I will use the rest of the cherries in salads or on cereal, but I won't buy them again 
 He is the reason korn is hear to day, so all you korn fans, Dont hate him love him. Because he made the world of metal a whole lot better. If you were a true korn fan you will support him all the way.Why blame him that he left korn if you were unhappy you will do the same thing.head is my roll model he made me pick up a guitar and, Made me play like thire was no tomorrow.ok this album was ok but not the old school korn i like.everybody gives up something everyday that is part of LIFE So deal with it 
 This book was a huge waste of time and money, as all of the information is common sense and copied from other books. I found no new or interesting information here 
 This book was very easy to read and moved along quickly but it was by no means "good."  The plot was sometimes boring and sometimes just silly and the writing was banal.  Although it was a fast read, there are  hundreds of other books out there that are a fast read and capitivating.   Reading this book was a waste of my time 
 The text doesn't come close to describing any of the terrain rendering algorithms adequately. For this, the author refers the reader to whitepapers on the companion CD written by the original authors. After a short search on the Internet, I turned up a wealth of better written descriptions on 3d terrain rendering algorithms. I suggest others to do the same.  The author makes a big deal out of the importance of morphing vertex points to minimize the effect of  popping but provides no implementation description. As he says in the text: "I didn't want to limit your imagination..."  What a cop out!  The c++ code provided on the companion CD is cleanly written, compiled and ran without problems, but is also clean of any useful comments further mystifying the subject. Another search on the Internet turned up many source code examples with better documentation. 
 Wattenberg introduces an idea of enormous interest and scope and it was an interesting book to read in sense of topic and debate. However, Wattenberg also dilutes the debate into a one sided ethnocentric account of what is a global problem. He considered himself a liberal but i found his ideas and unneccessary views rather conservative and politically charged. I thought that although linked to politics he presented an extremely bias account, with a pointless degree of patriotism. I was extremely interested in the topic at hand and if written by a well founded neutral writer i trust that this review would be somewhat different unfortunatly it was not the case. I found myself a times, reading things twice out of emense interest but more often than not cringing and at times shocked at how he turned a book focused on world demography into platform to voice his overly oppionated views on almost everything. a low two i'm afraid. 
 Of course Stossel can talk big about busting them "liberals" but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them. Ever wonder why ABC hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths? Ever wonder why Stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks? This and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad  
 You might as well go read the National Enquirer, or Matt Drudge's mudsite, for this kind of drivel.  Yes Bill Clinton often was a sleaze around women, but this book follows the bread-and-butter wingnut EDS technique (Exaggerate, Distort and Smear), creating vast conspiracy theories, recycling hearsay and gossip from dubious sources, and relying often on anonymous sources.  Just read the reviews of this ludicrous book and all you get is a bunch of wingnuts foaming at the mouth about how the Clintons are basically the Commie-AntiChrist poised to take over the world!   Why are they so scared of a Hillary presidency that they keep having to churn out pulp like this?  It'll never happen anyway, all a candidate Hillary would do is massively mobilize the redneck vote.   
 I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.   
 I bought this book purely on the strength of its being written by Jeffrey Deaver.  However, less than 3 pages into this terrible novel it becomes very hard to believe that it was written by the same man who brought us The Bone Collector and the Coffin Dancer.  The fact that it was written in 1988, before Deaver was established, may explain some of its mediocrity but there is no excuse for the fact that this is simply a terrible book.  The basic plot is that Rune, a supremely annoying "punk" discovers a favourite customer of hers shot to death when she goes to his apartment to collect a video he has rented 18 times in one month.  The film is a "true" story about a Manhattan bank robbery in which a police officer steals a million dollars which he hides away and which has never been found.  In the biggest jump to a conclusion I have ever come across, Rune decides that the the depiction of what was done with the money in the film is real and that Mr Kelly found it, and makes up her mind to find it herself.  The plot of the book probably could have been fairly good, but Deaver ruins the entire story with Rune, the most unrealistic and annoying "heroine" I have ever read.  She lives in a fantasy world that a 5 year old child would be too mature for, and has no concept of the real world whatsoever.  Everything about her, from her appearance to her manner of speaking to her ridiculous inability to lie makes the reader want to punch the book as it's the nearest thing possible to punching her in the face.  Another major problem with this novel is its glaring predictability.  There are no twists and turns in it and if Deaver thought anything in it was going to shock the reader, then he must have been as naive as Rune herself.  This book is chock-full of cliches that were probably old even in 1988.  This book has nothing to offer the discerning reader and it probably better left to those who see reading as hard work and only do it to reassure themselves that they can once in a while.  Complete and utter rubbish 
 We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and  inability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her view of women isn't much better in that they are supposedly the poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a  distasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is the  aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing  victim to only get children and love in return.If she can't see the pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers. Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why some people bother to read such books because it's a waste of  trees,paper and time! Another problem is she makes it sound as though women who  like intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as though she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse. She tries to make very subjective material sound like it's  supposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!! Very dangerous book 
 Bought for my wife and it is usless. Short battery life and poor suction. A total waste of money 
 The original edition of this book was published in 1977 and it and the succeeding editions are sponsored by the Sierra Club.  If you are a supporter of the eco values of the Sierra Club, that is reason enough to  buy the book and you will be completely in sync with the authors basic  proposition that we should care for the backpacking environment.  I agreed  with that thought in the first edition and still agree with it all these  years later in this edition.  Having said that, I do not value this book  highly and do not recommend it to anyone, specifically not to novice  backpackers.  Here is the problem; the book expends the vast majority of  its pages in the detailed listing of the component parts of gear such as  packs, boots or tents and spends almost no time in telling you how to  utilize the gear efficiently.  The very essence of backpacking is doing.   Putting the pack on and going.  This book goes to great lengths to itemize  the various straps on a backpack but really glosses over the where and how  to use it and all the other gear associated with backpacking.  In other  words, it definitely is not a "how to" book.  For that, I  recommend "The Backpacker's Handbook" by Chris Townsend 
 Having read dozens of books on adoption and foster care, I was looking forward to this book.  While some of the ideas were compelling, I found the tone to be too aggressive and some of the facts misleading.  I would not recommend this book 
 It starts out well but half-way through, it loses its direction and suffers an identity crisis. Avoidable 
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 For those of you reading the entire series of  " In Death" books this is a real disappointment.  I'm wondering if someone else wrote it.  There is no candy bar thief, Peabody, McNab development,  insights into Eve's past, just nothing!  Yes, Mavis having the baby is progress but that could have been done in 5 pages.  Please Nora, spend a little more time with the characters in the next book.  Or if you are tired of them, wrap it up.  This one is a real stinker. 
 Okay- I know that this is a seminal work re: the Middle East, but it is as dry as any other history text that you might find on the shelves of MiddleEast 101.  In comparison to Price of Honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region, it pales in comparison 
 A first novel--and it shows. Has all the charm of Barbara Pym's best work (Excellent Women, No Fond Return of Love) but is marred by narrative clumsiness and (frankly) lousy technique: characters appear out of nowhere, conversations start one place and end in another, etc. Skip this and focus on her later, great work 
 If you have a "day job" and own a few rental properties on the side, this book won't help much.  It's got some cool ideas for someone that wants to add some pizzazz (read "work") to thier property management practices.  I have to admit that I even used one or two ideas.  But this isn't a reasonable "how to" for someone who actually needs help learning how to rent properties.  I didn't use any of the forms, either.  They are too casual and sometimes flippant - I wanted a more professional and legally sound basis to work from.  For a comprhensive guide get "Landlording: A Handy Manual for Scrupulous Landlords and Landladies Who Do It Themselves."  And don't forget Nolo's "Every Landlord's Tax Deduction Guide."  This topic needs it's own book.  Even "Landlording" won't educate you on this topic adequately 
 This is probably one of the worst books ever published. 1st of all,it is trying to be allegorical when it really isn't. Kafka is great allegory. Innocence is not. Her ramblings read like bad confessional poems- like Sharon Olds- she had every cliche- being trapped underwater, blood, melodrama, etc... The ironic thing is that this book is SO bad you won't forget it. So I do recommend it so people can see how bad it really is. The sad thing is that there was a review written by a young girl who liked this crap & said how it has "inspired" her to be a writer. Sheesh. This is why bad writing does us no good. This book is easy to write and easy to read, and it gives hopefuls who can't see Jane's lack of talent hope, just as Sharon Olds gives bad women poets hope. UGH 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 The Cd isn't worth the money - liked only over the rainbow.  he has a beautiful voice, bad selection of songs  CD was in good shape, seller OK also 
 It's a good text for Precalculus as long as you have someone along to check your work, the CD is basically useless.  The first two chapters don't load some of the animations due to Java errors on Windows, and there are no practice tests on the CD.  The answers in the back are fine, as long as you know how to get them.  This version DESPERATELY needs the study guide 
 Brian trys to move into a different direction and fails on most of the selections.  While growth of an artist is expected sometimes it doesn't work 
 The idea for the book was great, but the book was way too long, although the ending wasn't quite long enough. You shouldn't read this book until your 16 or 17, at least. It was way too confusing for me. Some parts of the book were more intersting than the others, and it was interesting to see into her life, but definately not a book to put on a young adults list 
 Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces.  I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products.  But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues.  I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points.  We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds.  This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, "The Food Pharmacy" by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references.  Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce 
 Unfortunately, I have not received the item.  It's been 4.5 weeks since I placed the order.  I am reviewing this a low star, it should not take this long to receive a magazine subscription 
 Quick! Name two Eddie Money songs....... 	I said "Quick!!!!".........I know, it's been a while, and you never hear this guy on the radio anymore, so it's understandable that you'd struggle a bit, but...what? 	"Two Tickets to Paradise"? Excellent. That's one. Now give me another...............C'mon, you can do it. They played it every day for nearly two years on album-oriented radio back in the day....... Need a hint? 	....."Whatever will be will be..." Does that help? 	"Baby Hold On to Me." YOU GOT IT!!! 	Awesome. Those are undoubtedly Eddie Money's most famous songs, right? 	Now, for bonus points, name just one more. Come on, double or nothing. Okay, I'll go even better than that, TRIPLE or nothing. Just one more song. Just.......one........more............... 	You can't do it, can you? Well, to be honest, neither could I. So why in the world would I want to own a collection of Eddie Money songs if it DOESN'T EVEN CONTAIN HIS TWO MOST WELL-KNOWN SONGS??????? What are they thinking? 	"We Are the Eighties" is a new CD series that compiles songs from has-been artists who had a modicum of popularity twenty-five years ago, but today couldn't sell water in a desert. Now, Eddie Money seems like a really nice guy, and I certainly do not want to offend him, but I'm sure he's aware of the fact that he isn't getting much airplay these days, and so is Columbia/Legacy, his record label. As a ploy to appeal to ageing baby-boomers, they are re-packaging his stuff as part of this "We Are the -80s" series. The problem is, Eddie's biggest hits date from the `70s, and so this collection simply ignores their existence. Instead of compiling a genuine "Best of" collection, we get fourteen tracks of thoroughly dated and totally forgotten material. The only track that even rings a bell is "Take Me Home Tonight/ Be My Baby," and that's only because I remember that crappy video with a cameo from Ronnie Spector. 	Honestly, if Columbia really wanted to do their artist a favor, and sell some records, don't you think they'd at least include his hits on this compilation CD? Or, if their intent is to focus on artists from the `80s, why choose Eddie Money? As I type this, there are at least four collections available that feature Eddie Money's Greatest Hits (not to mention his first album, which is a virtual greatest hits all on its own), so why does this CD even exist? Eddie may not be a star any longer, but he still deserves much better than this. This may be the most ridiculous repackaged product of the past ten years.		F	(Sorry, Eddie) 		Tom Ryan   
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 This film was not in english and very hard to follow.  I threw it ou 
 It took about 10 hours of work to make it function with a MacBook running OS X 10.4.6 and an Epson CX 6400, and I needed a windows XP PC to set it up, but yes it works.  For Mac installation, the trick is that (using the windows xp pc connected with wire - not wirelessly) you need to change the static IP of the server to a DHCP given by your router and then you have to go trial an error with your browser to find whatever address it was assigned.  On the Mac, set it up as an LPD printer.  Also, make sure you type the queue name exactly as it is shown on the status screen and God help you if you don't have one of the printers listed on the packaging 
 The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 When I saw a book covering the exploits of Navy SEALs in Iraqi I thought it was far too soon for anything interesting to be declassified.  I was very right.  Mr Couch's book probably does the best job possible without offending Navy censors, but that still makes for a boring book.  Less than 10 operations are covered, and even then many of the details were left out.  The rest of the book is filler with information about training and command structures.  Maybe in 10+ years Mr Couch will be able to write a more interesting book about Mid East SEAL operations when the information is released to the public 
 When I first heard Faith No More was putting out an album called, "Album of the Year", I got pumped.  I knew "King For a Day/Fool for a Lifetime" was a flop, so I thought this was the bands attempt at getting back on track.  I was sadly mistaken.  This album, to my amazement, got very good reviews at the time it was released.  I just didn't see it.  "Last Cup of Sorrow" was a decent song, as was "Ashes to Ashes", but other than that, I saw nothing but a collection of mediocre to weak songs, most of them being more on the weak side.  This was a disappointing end to a band that started off with a tremendous bang, with "The Real Thing", and "Angel Dust".  Two remarkable albums.  I wish I could say the band members moved onto better things, but if you call Mike Patton's insanely childish ramblings in his 17 other bands good music, all power to you.  
 "Complete reference" - I thought this would describe/explain the SQL code that I need to use in my job.  This book sits on my desk at work - for SQL code, I get it from the internet 
 What started out as a somewaht interesting read quickly degenerated into an obviously hastily written attempt at demonstrating  to Mr Pickover what a great he is in his own mind.  Between self serving reminders of of many books he has published, he occasionally does present an interesting concept or two, but the frustraton in having to wade through the endless tedium made me want to shove an ice pick through my left temple.  I heartily enjoyed "A Passion for Mathematics",  I wish I hadn't bought this one 
 This book describes Cameroon as the armpit of Africa. Seriously. It said that. At least 1/3 of the book is on all the different types of diseases one is sure to catch being there. It says that Cameroon is unique in that there is a type of malaria that will KILL you in 24 hours of the first symptom. This book scared me so much that I went to Egypt alone instead of going with my friends to Cameroon. There arent really any books just on Cameroon. Lonely Planet has one on West Africa which I should have gotten. My friends went and had a wonderful time. The book should have talked about the good things this country has- which as it turns out there are other things there that Malaria! Perhaps if I would of read a different book then I would have not canceled my flight to Cameroon. 
 Todos los tpicos tienen algo de verdad, y aqul que dice que Borges es un escritor pedante para pedantes no es en absoluto una excepcin. Sus historias, a pesar de estar cuajadas en ocasiones de ideas interesantes, se ven total y completamente empaadas por el afn didctico y pomposo del autor a la hora de inundar sus escritos con referencias tanto reales como imaginarias a todo tipo de obras, autores, sucesos, etc, etc. Sus cuentos suelen adoptar ms bien la forma de un ensayo o de una disertacin filosfica que la de un relato convencional. Esto bien podra parecer algo original y audaz a simple vista, pero su ya mencionado didactismo, su escaso ritmo y la casi nula caracterizacin de sus personajes, restan muchsima fuerza a unas historias que, entre tanto aderezo culto y metaliterario, pierden todo aliciente a los ojos de cualquiera que haya disfrutado de narradores ms hbiles y conocedores del medio en el que se mueven.   Todava estoy tratando de dilucidar por qu diablos cosas como "Ficciones" o "El Aleph" estn consideradas como obras maestras cuando su inters no me parece que vaya ms all de lo puramente anecdtico. A todas luces el de Borges es un caso claro de egocentrismo o de vastas influencias literarias mal asimiladas.  Los aduladores borgianos, esa grimosa secta compuesta (generalmente) de elitistas literarios, seguramente dira, leyendo crticas como la ma, que la razn por la que Borges me desagrada es "porque no lo entiendo". Nada de lo que preocuparse, pues es bien sabido que para ellos toda aquella crtica negativa a su escritor de cabecera viene dada desde la frustracin de quien no logra aprehender al "seor del bastn". No falla, probad a poner en duda la grandeza del argentino, y ya veris cmo en pocos instantes os llueve encima un torrente de dicterios por parte de sus incondicionales poniendo en duda toda vuestra cultura general. En fin, que visto lo visto habr que borrar la palabra "pedante" del diccionario, total, como no hay libros malos, sino slo libros que no se entienden por los que los critican...  Jams he llegado a observar mayor grado de sectarismo que el que rodea a este autor por parte de muchos de sus admiradores (ni siquiera por los fans ms agresivos de autores "frikis" como Tolkien o Lovecraft), y en parte es por eso tambin por lo que no me gusta. He llegado a conocer gente que modifica sus gustos y preferencias literarias como borreguines para que casen exactamente con los de Borges. Y es que es tal el grado de arrobamiento comnmente requerido para la "correcta" apreciacin de este escritor, que de verdad a m me enferma. Sin duda a Borges se le puede considerar, independientemente de sus mritos literarios, un autntico soberano de insufribles.  No niego que Borges era un buen lector, que su amor por la literatura se deja traslucir de sobra en sus escritos, y que como crtico era bastante avispado, pero desde luego, en el plano literario, era totalmente incapaz de algo tan sencillo como contar una puetera historia sin exhibir gratuita y sistemticamente su supuesto grado de erudicin. En mi opinin, un narrador nefasto que obliga al lector a "adaptarse" continuamente y sin remisin a sus referentes culturales (como si stos fueran imprescindibles o necesariamente fascinantes). Presuntuoso, superfluo y, sobre todo, frustrante, pues promete lo que ni sabe ni puede dar.  He optado por escribir este comentario en castellano, idioma en el que Borges redacto sus obras, pero para el que curiosamente nunca tuvo nada bueno que decir hasta que recibi el premio "Cervantes". En fin que -aparte de su incompetencia literaria- fascinante desvergenza la suya (iba a decir "chaqueterismo" pero se me olvidaba que Borges es uno de los pocos con patente de corso para drselas de listo inventando neologismos, as que mejor ser callar, que igual no estoy capacitado, vete t a saber...)     Un clsico sobrevalorado ms (y van...). Puestos a tener que elegir algo que lleve el nombre de Borges, creo que me quedo con la famosa marca espaola de frutos secos. Me resulta ms digerible 
 Includes a DVD with OS for Linux. Only the last few sections deal directly with Linux commands and only briefly. Most of this book deals with installation issues of different Linux OSs 
 BOO has to be the worst horror movie I have seen in a long time. Poorly conceived, badly acted (and, boy, is the acting BAD), atrociously written, sloppily directed and lacking anything approaching a genuine sense of atmosphere, this film has virtually nothing to recommend it. There are occasional (VERY occasional) glimpses of the film that might have been, but every opportunity is wasted and all we're left with is ninety tedious minutes of teenage histrionics and unnecessary (and unconvincing) gore. Even some of the potentially disturbing imagery (not to mention the presence of Dee Wallace Stone - oh, how careers can plummet!) cannot save it. The one thought I came away with at the end is 'How do people with so little talent and aptitude actually get the opportunity and funding to make a film like this in the first place?' I guess that's one of life's more baffling mysteries, that and the assumption on the part of film makers that horror fans will accept any old rubbish. Avoid this film like the plague. It is truly, truly dreadful 
 This book is fatally flawed.  Layard's notion that you can create happiness by removing risk from society is absurd.  Risk and challenge are what keep us alive.  Without it, we become nothing more than drones.  Instead of spending the time on this book, readers would do well to read Ayn Rand's account in her first novel, "We the Living," of what happens when people try to do just what Layard proposes in his book. "We the Living" is Rand's profound personal account of the swift and complete demise of her country and its people through the acceptance of the collectivist philosophies that Layard pushes in his book.  Living in Soviet Russia just after the 1917 Revolution, Rand lived with all the socialism that "Happiness:  Lessons from a new Science" claims is the only way, and grew to hate it all with such distate that she spent the rest of her life trying to abolish it. Her book alone is reason enough not to read this one 
 It's quite amazing that this book is a business best-seller.  The book contains nothing new and, in fact, the 17 so-called "laws" are just overblown statements of the obvious. For example, in the Law of Significance, the author "explodes" the myth of the lone ranger by stating that "the belief that one person can do something great is a myth."  Really? In the Law of the Big Picture he says, "people who build successful teams never forget that every person on the team has a role to play and every role plays its part in contributing to the big picture."  Another insight?  I could go on. However, equally important, the book does not contain any new research or even interviews with key team leaders. The conclusions, such as they are, come from secondary sources such as the popular press and the author's personal examples, none of which seem to be based on any real business experiences.  I returned the book to Amazon 
 the typical self proclaimed china hand writing books catered to the western audience with typical stories everyone hears if you are in the investing biz.  no added value except to "reveal" to the world what had happened to him or her.  do these writers trully understand china?; same question to be posed to the thousands of current and potential investors into china.  and can they offer insights that are practical, realistic and offers a true fact of what is happening daily on the ground?  i seriously doubt any writer can offer this in respect to china because china is a story of limitless permutations.  there is only one commonality in china, which is its damn hard to get it right, because there is no right or wrong in this environment.  so how does anyone who wants to know how to operate in this environment learn?  i beg to differ, but its not gonna be thru a book written by the gangs of so called "china hands" out there.  these books are like the ones that came out supporting the great hype about the "new ecnomony" when the heat was scorching white.  opportunistic but offers little value.  i'll only buy the soft cover versions of these type of books or reading it as borrowed material. there is absolutely nothing valuable in this type of undertaking other than entertaining one on a slow afternoon. the author doesn't trully understand the reasons why things and events like those that transpired while he was ther in the early 90s, he doesn't understand the deep down psychic of the chinese person that he is dealing with.  chinese as a society is very complicated and extremely difficult to "read", and with the thousands of years of upheavals and sufferings of the masses, a twisted sense of whats right or wrong flows thru to today's society.  understand the meaning of "middle kingdom" and the world will have a starting point on why things are done the way they are today.  understand why "putonghua" has to be implemented  to bring all the different sects of chinese together is also another start.  i have yet to read any of this and a hundred other basic seeds of discontent that creates the china it is of today and why it behaves the way it does.  i doubt that anyone will be able to put it in on paper with  a certain thoroughness as it will create lots of uneasiness and tensions that has been around for 5000 years.  chinese will not accept a book on this and the western reader will have difficulty fathoming the gist and hidden weight behind each nuance.  
 In her summary, Margaret Starbird complains that other theories on the Tarot are "...purely speculative and not supported with hard evidence...."  This could be the subtitle to her own book.  She has written an interesting, even intriguing, thesis and this work is her first chapter, but where is the rest of the book that supports her thesis?   I've been a student of Tarot through the BOTA system for 22 years and am engrossed/obsessed with the Holy Grail theories, ala "Holy Blood, Holy Grail."  I was hoping for insight on the two issues, but found only unsubstantiated theory here 
 I can still remember the feeling of confusion upon purchasing this album in '98.  I was your typical Manson fanatic.  I tuned in at Smells like Children, backtracked to Portrat, and then was completely blown away by Antichrist.  Manson instantly rose to the level of my personal hero and guru.  Antichrist Superstar, is, without a doubt, one of the finest albums I have ever experienced, and still is.  I thought of Manson as an powerful demigod.  Hell, I probably would have killed my parents if he asked me to.  And then this,... this... travesty.  The shock, the horror.  In september of '98, Marilyn Manson threw away all his power to pay homage to Glam Rock of all abominations.  To expose the shallowness of Hollywood....  um, hello? What happened to the evolution of the Antichrist?  What about all that Antichrist left unfinished?  Your minions were waiting to hear your orders... and you failed them.  CAREER SUICIDE FOLKS!  End of the show, curtains up.  I woke up in a daze, not really knowing where I was or what to think. My world collapsed. Manson had that kind of hold over me.    Perhaps it was trent's production skills on Antichrist that really made Manson who he was.  It certainly seems that way, as Mansons last 3 efforts have been progressively more pathetic.  I think of Manson's discography like the movie Star Wars.  The first three are amazing, the last three are absolutely horrible.  You may need special eyes and ears to understand why that may be the case.  To anyone that was around when Antichrist hit the shelves and changed the world, to those that were tuned in, and, who tuned out as soon as they heard Dope Show, I say, fear not.  Life goes on.  Someone else will pick up where manson left off 8 years ago.  Where is the sincerity in this record?  Its nothing but shallow material and self serving nonsense.  What happened to the man ready to sacrifice himself to the cause of exposing religion, of embracing his own depravity and evil? What happened to my childhood hero?    This cd gets one star for the unparalleled power Manson gave up to realize his menial, small-minded glamrock concept.  May he rot forever 
 This product is a waste of time! Don't bother. The handheld game is entertaining for my daughter, but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least! Once connected, we walked around the "virtual world" with nothing to do. It is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone. There are much better products out there for children that are similar, but easier to play with. I would suggest Webkinz or Neopets. These 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play, unlike the Muichiz site! Good luck.. 
 Pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers, whose very existence and relevance is due to that king. What you will get from that kind of writing? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. Sound familiar? Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. Probably she does not care. Americans are lucky that they never had any king. Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS, Iran-Contra, welfare, deficits, funding mujahideens, cozy relationship with Saddam. Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler, happy citizens..."happily lived ever after". Basically, this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer.  Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don't know already. This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80's (which is nothing new in human civilizations). Secondly, she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans. But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan, except all the negative things, like Iran-Contra. In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings, characters of kings and the writings about them 
 This book is for those pastors who are wanting new insights and resources for ministering to a postmodern society.  The strength of these authors' writing is their dedication to ministering to the postmodern concept of family.  However, they state, "Our definition of family is more empirical than ideological.  It takes `what is' seriously before affirming `what should be.'" I am saddened that these authors have acquiesced to the social norm and are suggesting that the church do the same.    These authors suggest divorce rituals in which religious communities gather around the divorcing member or member couple and offer a public and spiritual occasion for "redefining" their relationship. As if divorce isn't easy enough, now the church can simply redefine things.  What kind of message does this send to our youth, as well as to other people who are struggling to keep their marriages together?   They also fall into the trap of defining family as "anything anyone wants to make it."  Yes, this is the "way it is" in society but we will fall into complete familial anarchy if the church abandons what God has established for the family.  They state, "It's a social fact that lesbian and gay couples establish enduring partnerships as stable and long lived as many marriages.  What is most congruent with Gospel values - to ignore such life-giving faithful commitments or to offer recognition, blessing, and the support of the wider Christian family?"    They even give instruction to the church for dealing with cohabitating couples.  They propose that choosing to live together even without a wedding is a commitment and that the church should welcome them as members, but they suggest caution in putting these folks in "role model" positions such as teachers of children or advisors of youth groups; as if one has to be a teacher or advisor to be a role model.  We are all role models, regardless of our position or function in the body.  It may be a new day for family ministry, but it is a sad day for the church if we allow society to define us.      
    Reilly fans will probably find his latest novel to be quite a disappointment. For some reason, Reilly forsakes all the things that made his earlier books great.  Instead, this novel is a thinly disguised political statement which reveals Reilly's prejudices against various governments and religions. The plot is obviously borrowed from "The Da Vinci Code" and the characters are one-dimensional pawns whose main purpose is to verbalize Reilly's personal ideology.  For the first time in a Reilly book, I managed to finish the book out of sheer determination rather than out of any interest in the plot or characters. 
 This volume has some excellent material, but it suffers from the authors' lack of empathy for the Sant tradition of India 
 I want a complete and diverse needlecraft library and I was pleased to see this book listed.  But the reviews and book descriptions led me to believe it would be innovative and new.  It's not.  The layout of the book, the photos and the illustrations are excellent.  The patterns are mundane. I don't use novelty yarns, at all - so I knew I would be adapting the patterns using merinos, silks and wool blends.  The problem with that plan is the book is all about the novelty yarns.  Once you take away the novelty there is nothing left but basic plain crocheted vests, ponchos, shells and a few accessories.  I like easy, I like fast, but I also like style.  I was looking for a new take on the square, a way to put crocheted squares together in a new and exciting way.  I did not find it with this book.  I will gift this book to someone who appreciates novelty yarns in all their glory - because it is a beautiful book and deserves a good home where it will be used and appreciated 
 Immature... smug... arrogant yet insecure. It's really hard to sympathize with a character who is so completely self-absorbed, bitter and judgemental. What were her redeeming qualities?   It sounds like I'm alone in this, but I found it hard to relate to her -- it really seemed that she was unloved throughout most of the story because she was ... unlovable.   
 I tried to like this book, but by page 61, I had to put it down. The main charachter, Helen, is a self-absorbed tramp and an unfit mother. She kisses people on a whim. She flirts and sleeps with anyone in town. She talks about how much she misses her daughter, who is away at camp, but I don't believe that she thinks of anyone by herself. She drops the F-bomb casually, as if that were speech becoming of a lady...which she is not. The plot is absurd. That she could be as callous and crude as she is represented to be and as popular as she is also purported to be, is impossible. This character is lewd, obstinant, selfish, childish, and impetuous. Do not pick this book up unless you admire loose women who are horrible mothers. Disgusting, and not a very funny book, either 
 Typical Feinstein ("A Season on the Brink" excepted).  Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc.  This book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long Island.  The subtitle, "Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black," is used here as a figure of speech, meaning "behind the scenes."  ("Inside the ropes" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.)  Feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion.  We see U.S Golf Association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf course.  Yet the book does not fulfill its promise.  My guess is that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis I had hoped for 
 Richard, there must be more info in all the research that you did.  I thought you would pick up where Anthony Sommers left off.  Hoovers faults were taken rather lightly instead of showing what an evil person he was-probably the most flagrant violator of civil rights this country has ever seen.  I do give you credit for the fact you did bring up-if you didn't tow his line , you were ostrasized.  His crime fighting skills were vastly overrated 
 I love Eddie Murphy, and I loved Dr. Doolittle!  The previews of Dr. D II looked so funny, I couldn't wait to see it.  Well, I just saw it, and my mind has still not recovered.  Dr. Doolittle 2 is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The story and dialouge are so mind-numbing, even the animated Murphy and Raven Symone, who plays his teenage daughter, couldn't salvage it.  The story revolves around Dr. Doolittle trying to save the patch of forest behind his house from a land-hungry developer.  To do this, Doolittle must rehab a tame bear and make him wild, because this bear is an endangered species, and if he lives in the forest, the developer can't touch it.  Sounds kind of cute . . . it's not.  The bear acts and sounds like a washed up Vegas lounge singer.  His whiny voice (Steve Zahn) is so annoying that even I, a passionate animal lover, could not summon a shred of sympathy for this bear.  And talk about long.  This whole thin storyline is dragged out for ninety minutes until I writhed in pain.  And the other animals!  A sad, alcoholic French monkey, a chamelon with a horrible Mexican accent, and an abusive bear and his passive female bear.  When the bear is not whining, a dog is narrating the whole film in another nasal, bland voice with HORRIBLE dialouge.  A subplot involves his daughter rebelling and liking a boyfriend who is a complete idiot, is dropped off by a pizza delivery car and asks to stay two nights.  Murphy actually acquieses.  What an intelligent, lovely girl like Raven would see in this sorry homie is completely unbelievable.  It is hard to believe people (and animals) are going hungry when millions were wasted on this fart of a film.  It seemed like the voice actors were embarrased to be saying such stupid dialouge, and that the animal actors were embarrased to be acting such stupid roles - and I don't blame them 
 I agree with the previous reviewer who wrote of the guilt trip that this book gives to working mothers.  I am an Australian who is residing in the USA, and I am shocked and appalled at the American attitude towards working mothers.  In Australia it is the norm for women to pursue careers and work in fulltime jobs, whether they are single, married, de facto, mothers, young, old, whatever.  Childcare is a policy issue for government, is often subsidised, and considered imperative for the growth of the economy and the wellbeing of the community.  What assistance does the American government give to working mothers?!  How does the American media portray mothers of Generation X?!  The attitude here is so far behind it is laughable.  For American authors to claim authority over subjects such as Generation X and its place on the world stage, they will need to update their ideas and look to other societies as well as their own.  
 I would not buy this version of the old classic for very young children.  In this version two of the pigs get eaten by the wolf, and the wolf gets eaten in the end by the last pig. When the pigs ask for the materials to  build their houses, they do not offer to pay, trade or work for the straw,  sticks or bricks, they are given the materials. What kind of message does  that give our youth 
 I read these 5 star reviews and the synopsis and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I like odd. I read the first few pages/chapters and thought it was "different", but kept waiting to be taken away to a dreamland carnaval. I forced myself to keep going, thinking it was just a slow-starter but I was never seduced like the other reviewers. Very interesting premise, but I was quite disappointed 
 To me,the most notable aspect of Chabon's style of writing is his ability to  describe disgusting things (notably food) in a disturbing manner. He describes sad human cases with a pretentious detachement and a punctilious care of ambient and objects details that can't replace a more profound analysis of the characters'stories: those would be interesting, if we knew less of tapestries and the content of suitcases and more of the inner turmoils and interpersonal conflicts of the unfortunate persons whose misfortunes are narrated. At the end of the stories I felt as I  missed something. As of the final horror story, that's a bit better,pretty chilling,  Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith come to mind, but Cha bon's elliptic style is once again frustrating. 
 I am a member of obesityhelp.com and having read the message board and replied to many, in addition to having attended 5 local seminars and numerous support group meetings, I didn't learn anything from this book I didn't already know.  However, if you are just starting out on this journey, this is a great book.   I have researched lapband surgery for more than 2 years and had heard about this book but couldn't find it in the library system here nor in any local bookstores, even thought I live in a large city in NE Florida. So, I ordered it.  Its a good read but not if you've already done your homework and lots of research.  
 The trouble with most movie books is they're written by people with, at best, questionable credentials.  Most of them are written by university film department drop-outs - disenchanted Humanities majors who spent too  much time in the rear stalls of some of the seedier art houses.  But, if  Roger Ebert can make a living at it (and win a Pulitzer Prize for it), then  anyone can.  Why not you 
 I agree with another reviewer: this CD isn't worth writing home about.  Anthony has a good voice and with the exception of Charlene and Where I come from, the other songs fade into boring Muzik for me.  I've tried several times to get into this Cd, each time, it becomes nothing more that white noise 
 I have dry, fine, easlily tangled color-treated hair and thought this sounded like the answer. I was surprised to read the other comments since, for me, this just plain didn't work. My hair was as dry and frazzled as before I used it. I have better luck with conditioners that don't have to be left on for nearly as long a time. I recently discovered a great conditioner from my hairdresser called Bonacure which works in a few minutes and leaves my hair in great condition, shiny, managable and detangled. And for a mask I tried Keratase and it was fantastic and the consistancy made it easier to use and my hair was silky smooth and stronger. I really thought this would be amazing for any type of damaged hair but it wasn't the right choice for me. Maybe I would have had more luck with Fekkai's glossers 
 If this book were written by Tim LaHaye, Jack Van Impe, etc., it would probably get one star with no problem. I have given it two because MacArthur doesn't lard his work with sensationalistic drivel. Despite that,  he, like all dispensationalists, fails to deal accurately with the text. It  is a constant source of amazement to me that the dispensationalist prides  him/herself on "taking the text literally," but then stumbles at  so clear a verse as Matthew 24:34: "Assuredly, I say to you, this  generation will by no means pass away till all these things take  place." (NKJV) Did Jesus mean what he said, or not? If he did, then  MacArthur's premise is faulty. If "this generation" means  something other than the generation to whom Jesus was speaking, how can one  claim to take the text literally? Unfortunately, MacArthur (whom I respect  as a fine Bible teacher in most areas) follows the dispensational party  line here, giving the phrase "this generation" an artificial  twist, so that it means "the generation that will see all these things  take place." Hint: it was the same generation that Jesus spoke to;  that's why he said "THIS generation" and not "THAT  generation."  So, when one starts with an erroneous premise, it is  hard to make any laudatory statement about the rest of the book. I wish the  dispensationalists would get together and agree to write just one book that  adequately addresses Gary DeMar's "Last Days Madness".. 
 The premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache.   I have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that 'Kingdome Come' was much better than 'First Horseman.' Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum 
 I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading.  I was so disappointed in this novel.  It did not meet my expectations.  I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly.  The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la "Weekend at Bernie's."  Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one.  
 While this book had a few good travel suggestions, I found it annoying that the author kept interjecting his personal opinions about every and all subjects. His accusations and conclusions were never supported with actual facts. He seems to view himself as a concerned citizen of the world with a strong social conscience, but he comes off as didactic and offensive. Very distasteful. There are many better books out there 
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 Notes and outtakes from the Mars series that should have been left on the cutting room floor. It appears that someone wanted to squeeze every red cent out of the success of the trilogy. Degenerates down to pages and pages of really bad poetry. Does not deserve even one star but that's as low as you can go. Terrible. Skip it 
 I had high hopes for this movie, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton, how could I go wrong with this movie with a cast like that? Despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script. The film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me. This was a poorly contrived and at times silly film. The tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try. Embarassing for all involved. I only give it two stars to be nice to the cast 
 I've purchased several of these bras in the past from Qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here. Though I was suspicious, I ordered one anyway. Not surprisingly, the cups puckered when I tried it on. Never had this problem with any ordered from QVC. When I inquired about returning it, I was disappointed to find they have a no return policy (though not posted anywhere I could find easily).   I believe this company sells '2nds' though does not advertise that fact.  I will not purchase from this company again, and I am now leery about purchasing through Amazon in general 
 I found this book offensive as a pagan.  I have no problem with Wicca as a religion, nor with those that admit it when they plaster other people's gods and goddesses onto Wicca.  What I do have a problem with is when one obviously did enough research on the Norse religion to know that it has very little in common with Wicca, and still claim that the Norse were Wiccan.  Freya and Freyr as the main deities?  Where did that come from?  I guess Odin was too manly to be the principal male in her mind.  The author not only ignored all research done by reconstructionists pagans, but she had to make Freyr, the most effeminate of the Norse gods, the principal male.   This was, unfortunately, the first book on the occult and Norse magic that I read.  Luckily, I actually did some research on the subject, and was able to discard it as useless in under a week.  I will say, however, the book is quite well constructed.  I have ran over it with a truck, left it outside for weeks at a time, used it as a coaster, etc., and the cover hasn't even fallen all the way off yet 
 I bought this movie set for my nephew and have to say that I was unpleasantly suprised to hear the language used in this "Cartoon".  Fine if your child is 13 and you don't mind, but NOT for little ones 
 If he were alive to see what Allen did to his Robot Universe, he would strangle the guy. This is a perfect example of why Allen should've stuck to those Little House On The Prairie sequels. The basic idea of Inferno (Just like it's predecessor, Caliban) is the creation of two new kinds of robots: The New Law robots and the No Law robot, and their effect on the society of the planet Inferno. The New Law Robots are freer than the original Three Law robots in Asimov's books, but have their own share of problems; Caliban, the only robot created with no laws, is of course the most free, but is far from human. This is all well and good, and in a more capable writer's hands would have been interesting, but Allen takes his one or two good ideas and throws them in a turbine. I'm sorry, Mr. Allen, but I don't really care about the intimate details of Tierlaw Verick's body, or anyone else's, for that matter. Whatever happened to "don't tell, show" 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, BRIAN KILCOMMONS AND SARAH WILSON ARE BOTH COMPLETE IDIOTS. WE USED THIS BOOK AS A REFERENCE WHEN WE BOUGHT OUR BICHON FRISE, WHAT A MISTAKE. IN THE BOOK IT STATES A BICHON CAN BE A 9-5 DOG SO WE BOUGHT ONE. BICHONS ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO HOUSEBREAK,ALL THE BOOK SAYS IS THEY 'CAN' BE HARD TO HOUSEBREAK. THIS BOOK HAS COST US HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. WE ENDED UP GIVING OUR DOG AWAY TONIGHT BECAUSE WE COULD NOT GET IT POTTY TRAINED AND AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH FOUND OUT THAT BICHONS DO NOT LIKE TO BE LEFT HOME ALONE. THE BOOK ALSO SAYS THAT A SHIH TZU IS A NINE TO FIVE DOG BUT AFTER RESEARCHING THAT BREED THEY ALSO DO NOT LIKE TO BE HOME ALONE ALL DAY. THESE TWO AUTHORS NEED TO FIND A DIFFERENT LINE OF WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPLETE IDIOTS WHEN IT COMES TO DOGS. THANKS BRIAN AND SARAH FOR WRITING SUCH A CRAPPY BOOK! 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 Bought because it's purportedly a 'MUST READ' of recommended English 19th century literature and I'm trying to read every good book I can before I die (hopefully at 90). Unfortunately,  this book is a waste of time as it's BoRiNg (even w/ the footnotes that I so dearly love).  
 I ordered this CD on May 19 and I have not yet received it.Please advise as to what to do about this. I know I have been charged and I would like to think this doesn't happen very often.  You might know, the first time I order CD's off the net and one of the 3 doesn't arrive 
 I rented this movie from Netflix recently, expecting a wonderfully campy, cheesy horror film. WRONG. Its just an hour and a half of boring film.  The plot is lacking, the characters are annoying, especially Duane.  Its simply a ridiculous film 
 This book turned out to be another release of the original book from the 1980s and it shows.  It is full of seriously outdated information and old style, pushy, boiler-room style telemarketing tactics.  Worst of all, it tells you to always push for the appointment and end the conversation there.  What about qualifying?  I can already set appointments all day if I don't bother to qualify them, but unfortunately those unqualified appointments don't buy.  Save your money and find a more up to date sales book 
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 It is a book about a dog. A cat liked a dog because he doesn't do dog things like bark at night,howl,beg and run away!There is a big suprise!I read some of the book so far and I liked it, so will you 
 This book dose a good job telling you were things are, but thats about it. It gives one 8 step process on how to draw the head, thats it. It dosnt give you any of the help that i thought it would, it dosnt explain the basics of drawing the head. It gives you a few rough, do this and it should be fine, but dosnt explain what 'this' is. I wouldnt sugest this book unless u just want to leard about the anatomy of the head, not if your looking for techniqes as the cover sugests 
 I was so disappointed in this book. I don't find a closeness to God in the pages. Instead it seems intellectual. It contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with God face to face. Even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal God I seek. And though the author's prayers are included too, I feel the same about them. I expected more from Richard J. Foster 
 The description says "slipcover zips off for easy cleaning", but the product did not come with a slipcover.  The pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern.  Now I have to find a slipcover that won't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath 
 Take the worst parts of:  David Baker era MERCURY REV THE WOLF GANG PRESS ROLLERSKATE SKINNY THE BEACHBOYS CAN DEAD CAN DANCE and SHADY,  Put them in a blender, set it on "wow, aren't we crazy!?", poor mixture into the glass of an overly hip, indier than though hipster, and then smash the glass over the hipsters head.  The resulting sound of glass breaking and hipster crying will sound better than this wannabe band 
 As some of the reviews below suggest (albeit approvingly), this is a one-sided rehash of the modern cliches about this era:  the Christians retaking their land are evil and intolerant; the Muslims who violently seized these lands in the first place are noble and benificent.  I look forward to reading Mr. Reston's forthcoming book on the bloody Muslim conquests of the Middle East, northern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Turkey and the Balkans, and their forcible conversion of millions throughout those lands, which were once predominantly Christian.  That should be a ripping good read.  I give it two stars because at least the prose is lively 
 In Hollywood films, kids are mean. They tell their siblings to drop-dead, roll their eyes at dumb-old-dad, barf all over the floor and run away, and always seem to have a snarky come-back for every situation. They are cynical, jaded, suspicious, and  totally lacking in innocence; they represent the worst aspects of adulthood.  In my opinion, films like this are like extended sit-coms - although most sit-coms are better written. My family was quite stunned by how nasty everyone was; there wasn't a kind moment anywhere except in the last 5 minutes, when syrupy-violins prompt us to recall how much they really "love eachother". If you want to see a film where kids act and talk like real kids, try to get your hands on a British film called "Melody", made in the early 1970's. It'll knock your socks off. 
 Denzel Washington and Bob Hoskins tested many critics' high opinion of them by co-starring in this awful supernatural comedy. Hoskins is a racist cop with a weak heart. Washington is a slick lawyer who dies and has his  heart transplanted into Hoskins. Denzel's ghost haunts Hoskins. Picture  "Watermelon Man" and "All of Me" combined, and done stupidly. The low point  comes when Hoskins awakes after his operation and finds a huge black dildo  his prankster buddies have planted in his pajamas. The two antagonists must  work together to catch Denzel's murderers and save Hoskins' hooker  sweetheart Chloe Webb. Denzel won his Oscar for "Glory" not long before  this was released; if not for that, it probably would've gone straight to  video. It would be a waste of time and money even to rent this (never mind  buy it) to see for yourself how bad it is 
 I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.   Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.  There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden 
 I bought this item like 2 months ago, and now it's broken. I'm sooo frustrated.   I 'd not recommend buying this item 
 On the plus side, this book was cheap and a quick read. However, I found very little tangible, useful information in it. Seemed to be mostly common sense stuff. 
 I was soooo disappointed with this one that I had to quit reading.  I felt that the authors insulted my intelligence as a reader -- no depth in its characters, no real plot, such TRITE writing!!    I was really excited to see a story that incorporates a fun "chick-lit" genre with cooking and recipes.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stomach the characters or the way the authors "spoon-fed" the story to me.  Very condescending...  I, too, am wondering how this book was published 
 I purchased this camera for my own birthday present last October.  I have owned it for 1 year and 2 months and now it isn't working.  I paid $400.00 for it last year when it was "new."  The LCD will only turn on every 15 - 20 times after I take the batteries out and turn the camera on and off. I purchased new rechargeable batteries, but that wasn't the answer.  I contacted Panasonic but it is out of the warrantee period.  They will charge a flat $140.00 to fix it and I can get a new one for about $150.00.  I loved this camera, but it is such a disappointment.  I was very easy with it - it just stopped working!  Buy a different camera - I wish I had 
 A dis-jointed book.  The only thing I found interesting was Ian's view on sorrow 
 This was a mess. This movie gave me the feeling that I was was watching a really bad made for tv film. I was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was. Everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. Viggo Mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan. All in all, this film was predictable, formulaic and a bore. Please save your money for something worthwhile 
 This book is a waste of time and energy.  The plot centers around a mother's murder of two of her children.  However, the author doesn't take the mother to trial, nor do we find out if she's acquitted or convicted. Save your money 
 MY GIRLS GOT THIS PUZZLE FOR CHRISTMAS. THE FIRST TIME THEY WERE PLAYING WITH IT I NOTICED SOMETHING IN MY DAUGHTERS MOUTH. THE ITEMS THAT WERE ON THE PUZZLE PIECE HAD CAME OFF WHICH HAD A SCREWS AND WASHERS THAT WERE HOLDING THEM ON. THREE OF THE FIVE PUZZLE PICECS HAD THE ITEM COME OFF AND WE HAD ABOUT TEN SCREWS AND TEN WASHERS. THEY ARE SUCH SMALL PIECES WHICH I WAS SO SHOCKED THAT THIS PUZZLE WAS EVEN MADE THIS WAY. I JUST WANTED ANY PARENT WHO HAS THIS PUZZLE OR IS THINKING OF BUYING IT TO BE CAREFUL AND MAKE SURE THE ITEMS ARE ATTACHED TEH CORRECT WAY. I HAVE CONTACTED CONSUMERS AFFAIRS TO LOOK INTO HAVING THIS PUZZLE RECALLED. HOPE THIS WILL HELP ANOTHER CHILD FROM BEING HURT 
 This book is slanted, negative, and disappointing. Unfortunatley, the author's political views and negativity permeate every paragraph of the book.    On page 6 she states, "I got sick right away.  Everyone does." She said that within days her chest felt bruised and aching from the job of staying alive..."  You get the idea.  Stay away from this book.  I love Afghanistan, and can't imagine why people have liked this book.  It is not the Afghanistan I know 
 Do NOT get this book -- which contains only the THIRD EDITION of the allowable Scrabble words.  If you want the FOURTH EDITION, which is current up through its publication in late 2005, use this number to search Amazon's catalog:   0877796343   which will take you to the Fourth Edition, Large Print.  For some reason, you can't find it by using words like "Scrabble Large Print" to find that edition -- you have to use the ISBN number.  Using the older edition might be okay if Amazon starts selling it at a discount; it's certainly good enough for friendly family games (in most families!) but won't get you where you need to go if you are playing competitively, and need the most current list of new coinages, acceptable 2-letter words, and q-words 
 When i stumbled upon this book in the library, i decided that it looked interesting enough to read. As soon as i got home, i read it all the way through, and was not impressed in the least. As i look at everyone elses reviews, i am confounded as to how this book has garnered so much praise. i have no idea why this is considered a classic, or why it is published by Modern Library. It doesn't deserve it. If you want a good book about homosexuality, read Giovanni's room by James Baldwin. Don't waste your time, as I did, on a book that fails even to elevate itself above bad soft-core porn 
 The translation is a bit of odd. I can't feel the rythm of Goethe's masterpiece 
 I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned.  Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. People have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have. Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!! I used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the Shampoo. I have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too. 
 I really didn't enjoy this piece. I had to read it for school. I complained alot every night I had to read it. It is really very confusing and I think that the overall book was pretty horible. It was probably on the list of the top ten books that I DIDN'T like. Others may have different feelings but I really didn't like it at all. 
 Sorry Troon, but you put a snowman up on this one.  What a big disappointment.  I loved the other Eddie C. books... I always tried to read one as spring approached to get me in the golfing mood.  But this ain't no golf book... and barely and Eddie C. book.  I feel like I was duped.  For others considering this as their next followup to The Green, The Foursome, and Scratch.... don't.   
 The oral history approach by Ambrose & Co offers certainly has its attraction. And if this book would have consisted of personal accounts of D-Day veterans only, I think it would have made a valuable, insightful, and memorable account of this landmark battle.   Unfortunately, the author did not leave it at that but felt the need to present his own, highly biased and overly patriottic views on the various aspects of the battle. The message that is spelled out again and again, in capitals, is that only the American troops and their commanders showed excellence in planning and carrying out the battle. Their allies, in particular the British, receive considerably less credit or even scorn. For example, the book ridicules the supposed British craze for "gadgets", such as their mini-submarines and special tanks, which they nonetheless used very effectively on D-day.   But what really annoys me is the personal "battle" that Ambrose seems to be fighting with the long-beaten German foe: all the decisions they took on D-day were wrong in his opinion, they responded way too late or not at all, they failed to foresee the invasion, their command structure was inadequate, their navy did not intercept the fleet "which nobody could understand", etc. etc. The truth is that by june 1944 the Germans simply did not have the resources to fight an agressive and intelligent counter-battle on the Western front anymore. I find it disappointing, a little cheap and certainly inappropriate for a scholarly historian to keep on criticizing the past performance of an enemy with the comforts of hindsight and imaginary resources. (Even more so as the included number of German combattants' accounts in this book is less than a handful.)   By the end of this book, I was thoroughly fed up with the hollow rhetorics and "easy" truths like "The Wehrmacht's many mistakes [on D-day] were exceeded by those of the Luftwaffe, which was quite simply just not there" (ch 32). Perhaps this style is what it takes to write a bestseller, but "D Day: June 6, 1944" fails as a military history book. 
 This book is awful...a complete waste of time for anyone with half a brain...if you only have half a brain, feel free to buy it.  It's overly simplistic, obvious, insultingly simple and unlikely to help a budding consultant make a dime.   If you want REAL advise, pick up any of Alan Weiss's books 
 I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much.  It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather. I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate. Dumpster fodder. 
 I purchased bean bag toss for my four year old grandson, it was his birthday, it was absolutely no challenge - no fun and required absolutely no dexterity.   very very disappointed, if it was possible to return it I woul 
 Bought this for my 3 year old daughter who really uses it a lot daily.  The level of edutainment is excellent for her age and she learns a lot from it.  My only sore point with it is the lack of strength of the perforated part of the pages (for the spiral binding).  The pages tend to be separated there so I think it will be a good idea to strenghten the perforated part of the book or to use some other form of binding that will not decrease the overall strength 
 I am researching Kundalini Shakti and thought this book may be of help. However, it soon became apparent that I had erred when the author stated that she had been instructed by 'higher beings', that the Aquarian age was forcing previously esoteric knowledge into the public domain, that the alignment of the planets would have some affect on my Kundalini and that I should indulge in free form dancing. The bulk of the text regarding Kundalini appeared little more that exercises in auto-suggestion and the actual chapter on how to release the Kundalini lacked precision. I could not recommend this to anyone seriously interested in Kundalin 
 This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on "Ways and Means" in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy 
 This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 "songs" all sound the same.  They are not "radio" or "stereo" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!!  
 Got the toaster oven instead of the convection oven twice.. 
 It's summed up on the back of the jacket:  "... a compendium of history's most ... fool notions, useless products ..." Substitute "publishing's" for "history's", and there you have it.  All of which begs the [next] question -- what was *I* thinking when idiotic enough to purchase this piece of slack-jawed trash?    
 Sufficient movie to waist a couple hours downtime here in Afghanistan. That's it though 
 The order was processed slowly, it was shipped days after it should have been.  The website said it was in stock ... yet an employee told me it was not in stock after they already had my money.  Of course, I paid instantly for it with American Express.    When the pants finally arrived AFTER the vacation I ordered them for, I was very disappointed with the quality of the elastic waist and the very poor design of the pockets ... I have purchased higher quality clothing at Walmart for 1/3 the price.  They refunded the postage.  If they had shipped them overnight as soon as they got them ... or if they refunded the shipping and their profit margin, I would have been pleased and impressed.    It was a disappointing experience with expediency, shipping, quality, price, and service.  At least nobody was rude.  Dr. B. dallas, texa 
 I had a problem with Brietta a day after I bought her. I was combing her hair, and suddenly her head broke! The part of her head that has hair seperated from her forehead, and there is no way to fix her. So she is stuck with a crack in her skull. I'm very upset about this.  Other than that, I adore my Brietta doll. She has long strawberry blond hair that curls at the end in a messy way, so I cut the hair shorter to get rid of the messy curls.  Her face has a gorgeous expression, which looks so friendly to me. Her gown is light pink with a real overskirt and long sleeves, and she has pink shoes that ACTUALLY STAY ON!  I'm just sad that she broke, but I still love her nonetheless 
 This album has no point whatsoever. Just another attempt for the Diplomats to get money. Get Cam'ron "Killa Season" because it is much better than this. Anyone who has seen the "Knick Knack" video realizes how much Purple City sucks. This album has one good song. Just download "Hustlers" featuring Jim Jones and B.G.; do not bother with the rest of the album 
 I find crisp sets problematic. Hoping to resolve some of the problems (for qualitative and comparative research) of crisp sets, I turned to this text. Ragin repeats himself time and time again in this text. Some complex topics (concentration, dilation, complex theoretical statements) receive minimal attention, leaving readers out in the cold. He fails to establish the efficacy of fuzzy sets for sufficiency or necessity. Ragin also fails to support why necessity is either valuable or possible in social sciences. I would seek to argue that necessity is virtually impossible to determine in social sciences. J.S. Mill was no sociologist. Also, when Ragin attempts to illustrate the application of fuzzy-set methods to IMF protests (chapter 10), he seems to neglect to include certain steps in the calculation of membership scores in the set with severe IMF protests. Ragin does not provide enough qualitative data to support why each country was indicated to have membership in his seven levels of IMF protest membership (p. 265). Also, when Ragin discusses assessment of fuzzy set membership (p. 165 - 171), I feel that fuzzy set membership assignment provides too much flexibility to individual researchers that severely hampers retestability (or even critical analysis) of the data. Ragin skirts the issue of researcher subjectivity when he makes statements like (p. 166, and similar statements in other portions of the text): "The steps I sketch here assume that researchers have a solid understanding of the concepts appearing in their theories and that they have an extensive base of relevant substantive knowledge as well." I certainly feel that the 'crisp-set approach' can be highly problematic, but Ragin's fuzzy-set approach does not seem to be a well-formulated answer to social scientific quandrys presented by crisp sets 
 I have to agree with the rest. When I first heard the dubbing, I thought something was wrong with the DVD big time. Still blows me away a dude that produced his own movie would dub his own voice. That's a new one for me and completely screwball. I still like the guy but after watching this movie (yeah I actually watched the whole thing), I'm beginning to wonder why. He used to kick butt, now he's just kicking our butt by taking our money. Seems he has resorted to completely ripping off his fans with this garbage film. This demonstrates to me where we rank in his favorites list. Someone should take him aside and ask him what the hell is he doing. I know the guy is still capable of making a good movie. He needs to be directed by someone why knows how to show his strengths and get rid of his weaknesses. When he moves slow and deliberate (especially is his fight scenes), he looks good and cool. When he moves too fast and shows too much emotion, he just plain sucks. C'mon Steven, you can do better than this 
 It is a well known fact among scientists that global warming is REAL and that humans are at least contributing to this planet's rising average temperature.  It is also a fact that the oil cronies are trying to spread misinformation that global warming is either not occurring or that humans are not having any affect on it.  These oil cronies also want everyone to think that if global warming is not a myth, it's a debate among scientists.  Furthermore, many of the scientific research that shows that WE are causing global warming have been suppressed by oil industry special interests.  Bush, who does everything to cater to the oil industry, has suppressed much of this knowledge himself.  This book is just part of this special interest propaganda.  The bottom line is this: GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL AND IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE, AND EVERY TRUE SCIENTIST THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS KNOWS THIS.  If you have any doubt about this, read the original research articles in PEER REVIEWED academic journals, and make sure that they are PEER REVIEWED.  PEER REVIEWED journals are where REAL knowledge and research get published.  This book is hogwash. 
 I loved this Cordless headset until I found another that was under fifty bucks which was just as good.  (R*dio S***k 
 I have been a Dean Koontz fan for years. When he is at his best, heis books are VERY good. I used to think that even when he's formulaic, at least his books are always entertaining. Recently, I've had to reevaluate him. He can write books that are bad. I was disappointed by "The Taking", and now this... I've been listening to this as an audiobook, but now I'm turning it off. I usually don't write reviews on books or films I don't finish, but this one, I had to give up and feel abliged to warn others.   I made it almost halfway through the book, waiting for something to happen. I really don't care to know how the story ends because it's hardly started yet. There are several parallel plots, all overwritten, with long portions of text where nothing happens and too many characters that feel not realistic, but constructed to be likeable and/or funny. I've always liked the way Koontz writes characters you really get to know and care about, but this time it's way too overdone. They can't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves and have endless dialogues that doesn't move the plot forward. Something must happen for a book to be interesting.  I was a big fan but I'm going to be very cautious about his books in the future. I'm not going to waste more time on this one. Not recommended even (or perhaps especially) for Koontz fans. 
 Have a Zen Vision M and this thing does not fit. It is about 4mm too wide and 2 mm too tall to fit on the screen. It does not tuck into or slip under the plastic around the screen either. Go figure 
 This toaster looks great, but it is incredibly slow, much slower than the cheapo toaster I owned before this one.  It takes 2-3 minutes for a piece of bread to toast.  It does seem to toast evenly, though.    It features a removable crumb tray, but the "shell" of the toaster is one piece, so there is still a solid bottom beneath the crumb tray.  If crumbs fall off the crumb tray they are trapped at the bottom of the toaster.  I have a couple of large crumbs stuck in the bottom of the toaster that I cannot get out.  Fortunately, they do not burn or smoke when the toaster is in use.  I would rate this toaster high on looks, low on performance 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 This was a tough one for me. Hew knows his stuff, but this highly condensed presentation was something of a drudgery for me to wade through. Perhaps that's because that is the way the war actually was, he he. There was no time for much reflection, humor or innuendo. Hew had to get it all in one volume and he succeeded by taking the Jack Webb approach; The facts ma'am, just the facts.  I am not very familiar with the geography or the politics of central Europe and this is a huge handicap for readers of Hew's book. While he was going into much detail about troop movements or front locations I was usually kind of lost as I tried putting it all together in my mind. It is as if he assumes the reader is  intimate with the territory.  Well placed detailed maps would have been a great help; these however are lacking. Oh, there are maps all right but they seem to have been inserted as an after thought between the table of contents and the introduction. And they look like sketches hastily drawn up and submitted just in time to meet publishing deadline.  There is a fabulous collection of color photo images of the war. Did you know there was color photography that long ago? I never realized WW1 was so colorful! This was a world war and the color plates show army uniforms from countries outside Europe. They do compliment a decidedly dry text and give the war a very ethnic shine.  This is the first WW1 history I have read. I have read other topics about the war but never a complete overview of the entire war from beginning to end. I am going to try another one because the subject of WW1 has always fascinated me. I am especially interested in the wars aftermath and how it has shaped the world we see today 
 We purchased this book to use in our accelerated curriculum since we have a substantial vocabulary unit connected to Frankenstein.  However, a few days into the book, we are noticing major departures from Mary Shelley's novel.  Kaplan has irresponsibly marketed this book as if it is the original version.  
 It's a disgrace they charge money for this DVD. Producer and actors should be ashamed this is sold.  Fine if people want to experiment with filmmaking, but to release this film with big name actors and charge consumer, unforgivable.  I prefer to have rated this with no stars 
 Better than No-doze. It ain't at Amazon# 1,000,000 for nothing 
 I was in the car the other day with a friend. We share different taste, but get along well. It was after school and I said I was going to have to do something if we do 'high school musical' as our musical next year. I listened to her and her mom inform me how it is the best thing ever. I watched it on my friend's ipod at her house. I wanted to turn it off, it was so very high pitch and predicable that is was horrible. She told be it would get better, but guess what it never ever did. There was nothing at all good in that horrible movie. I can't believe they call it a musical. Is this supposed to be a kid musical? Because I did not know that that meant a corny predicable thing. The songs have no meaning and I hate them. This by far the worst musical I have ever seen, no wait it is too bad to be a musical, it is by far the utter most horrible movie. What ever happened to real musical's : Annie get your gun, Phantom of the Opera, Rent, Music Man, West Side Story, South Pacific Wicked, Les Miz. Avenue Q., I could go on for ever. I hope this is not what musicals have come to. It is the worst thing i have ever heard or laid my eyes on.  Thanks p.s. don't buy it It is soooo stupi 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 This book is poorly written.  Although it is one of the most update-to-date versions out ther, it seems muddled and repetitive.  I was surprised at the number of grammatical mistakes and errors.  Clearly little time was spent editing this book.  I'm not sure how it got to be a New York Times Bestseller, outside of the fact that it is related to Harry Potter.  I'd advise going with a different biography 
 This book is partitioned into two sections: "Basic Narrative," which is a summary of antiquity from the agararian communities of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia and Egypt) to the fall of the Roman Empire and the emergence of the Christian community and; "Societies and Cultures," which is a more detailed look at those societies and cultures that fall within the book's qualifications and, to a certain extent, the relevance of those cultures to contemporary, Western society/culture. Every sentence if not every paragraph of the first section is a bold, arguable statement that begs further exposition, discussion or reading. Actually, it appears from the "Guide for Further Reading" at the end of the book, that the first section of this book may be a derivative summary of Cantor's readings of those materials. One might be better off reading those materials for oneself rather than relying on Mr. Cantor's synthesized book reports. Mr. Cantor's use of informal, laymen language makes this book further unsuitable for use as a reference or quotation within a thesis or other scholarly endeavor. The second section of the book loses some of the somewhat cavalier arrogance (which Mr. Cantor may have meant to come across as wit) of the first section but the disjunct writing styles within the section is perplexing. The created interview with St. Augustine is clever but the section on Civil Law lacks clarity and overall what has been cited as "authoritative insight" appears to be Mr. Cantor's ruminations or opinions. While the attempt to cover the breadth of the topic within a couple of hundred pages could be construed as either laudable or [a] folly, the result in this case is an embarrassing attribution to Mr. Cantor's erudition 
 Single mom moves with her 2 daughters to an isolated property up in the mountains that she recently inherited.  There, they encounter zombie kids killed off in a mining accident at the turn of the century. While the acting is somewhat decent (and the only feature of merit in this flick) everything else screams - GENERIC.  Poorly paced, poorly written and completely derivative of several dozen movies you've seen before.  Sadly, i've seen made -for-cable-tv cheeseball flicks on the Sci-fi channel with more appeal then this.  Definitely feel free to skip this film in the After Dark collection 
 In the right hands this novel could be translated into an exciting movie.  The premise is interesting, but falls completely flat with the sewn up ending.  A true happily ever after, that begs for a more smartly written sequel in which everything unravels would be delicious.  The hardest aspect to swallow was that this super extra terrestrial life form could divide out of control then just be neatly killed and carried to a lab in the desert for benevolent study.  Sheesh!  I really thought it was going to get scary at some point! The major antagonist of the story is a tattoed up ex inmate who fancies himself a master mind killer-when in reality he is just a sharpshooting (except when it really counts) boob!  And boy does he meet his match in a simple pair of desert folk, who happen to be expert gunslingers and survivalists to boot!  This is all very funny, but to me the funniest part of the entire book is the description of the male tyrannasaur mounting the female and trumpeting loudly in the wild prehistoric world he inhabits!!!! 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
  I keep on saying the best Lalo Schifrin is on his Jazz and soundtrack albums. He is specially a master in scenes of action on which he lays music with fresh movement, full of rhythm and harmonic insight, generally with the best orchestras and musicians in the place. 'Bullitt', 'Mannix', and 'Mission Impossible' are perfect examples of this.  Now that Mr. Schifrin created his own label Aleph Records, these important soundtracks have seen the light of day in CD format. Very good!  Unfortunately, 'The Amityville Horror' is a Schifrin's experiment in a series of terror ensembles with the same old clichés of this category. Sleepy 
 I learned a lot of information about Kepler, Kepler's family, the thirty-years war, and the counter-reformation. The writer's prose was very readable; however, the book lacked cohesion. The book had very little information concerning with Kepler developing his scientific theories and his search for harmony. The author jumped off on bunny trails for scores of pages without mentioning Kepler. He would write about the thirty years war and the political machinations that led up to it. He would then return to the witch trial of Kepler's mother. He would then breifly spend a little time on Kepler developing his theories and how it relates to his faith. The book seemed repetitious at times. Maybe bacause the witch trial went on for so long, but the book returns again and again to that same topic and how worried and frantic Kepler was.  I had a hard time finishing it. The book was a hard read. At the end, I had a hard time placing  all the pieces together. The topic was fascinating and the author did provide some interesting tidbits, but the narrative thread was hard to follow 
 This movie on Chomsky isn't very unique or interesting.  He is a brilliant man, and his books will obviously teach you more.  A good dvd to check out is manufacturing consent - man. consent is almost three hours long, with a good structure that the movie follows, with more complete explanations of Chomsky's ideas.  Rebel w/o a pause is a hastily put together film, which dedicates too little time to each current issue, i.e. the war in Iraq.  Entertaining, but not a good source of information 
 I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.  This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all.   As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order).   The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.  Jesus. 
 I was disappointed by "Beautiful Evidence". It seems to me to be a medium primarily for the reproduction of many gorgeous drawings, graphs, and tables done by others and the author, and an opportunity to make a rant on PowerPoint. Yes, many bad figures have been created and Dr. Tufte has made valid points and good suggestions, but they are not as densely presented as one would expect from his own words.  One of Dr. Tufte's main theses is a good figure has high information density, yet his text descriptions do not measure up to this standard. They are regularly repetitive or shallow. He even misses an opportunity to take his own advice when he presents the cancer rate data on p. 174 and then re-presents it as a new table on p. 176 in a better format. If he had used the concept he presented through the Bumps chart on p. 56, allowing lines for the cancer types to cross according to the values of the rates so each column is correctly ordered, relationships would have been even clearer.  Although tables can be dense with information, it is the very density that makes them difficult to interpret and understand. A beautiful, but very complex, figure created from all of complex table is not necessarily better at communication even if it is interesting or pleasing to look at. This is why so often figures are made from subsets of tables. The challenge to the presenter is to find what is important in the data and clearly present it.  I often felt attempts were made to find something auspicious to say about a well executed figure when nothing more than the "beauty is apparent" is needed.  Although I don't malign PowerPoint as Dr. Tufte does, I am not enamored of it either. However, faulting the program as he does seems to me akin to faulting a hammer for the bent over nails driven into wood. A better hammer might drive nails more easily, but it is the person wielding the hammer who has the primary controlling effect. Handing out a copy of "The Table of Casualties" to an audience would certainly put more information into their hands, but it will get little into their minds. It is up to the presenter to find a means of communicating the meaningful information to those who couldn't be bothered to study such data. Whether PowerPoint slides or Word reports are used, the presenter must consider the audience and how to get important details into their heads.   Spend time enjoying the figures and know good data presentation is hard 
 The Namesake attempts to get the reader to the soul of the immigrant experience, but fails, as the book primarily focuses on the one-dimensional, shallow, superficial Gogol (who is American born), instead of spending a little bit more time on Ashima and Ashoke.  She also stereotypes all first generation immigrants as well as desis in India, as insecure, uncultured, bourgeouis.  The reality is quite different - while a large percent of Indians in India or first generation immigrants may not buy cheese from Pyrrenes or sip wine, there is a tremendous amount of art, music, literature in cosmopolitan India.   I almost got the sense, that this novel was a catarthic and semi-autobiographical release for Ms. Lahiri.  As a first generation immigrant, I can tell the reader to not base their idea of indians on what is potrayed by Ms. Lahiri in form of Ashima, Ashoke etc.   Finally, being a Manhattan elite with food, parties and drinks SHOULD NOT be the only definition of something all Americans are striving for.   She does not potray America or India in the vast multi-dimensional ways that these two great nations should be!  Other than that, interesting details of life in NYC and good, clean descriptive prose!  
 This book is not useful, helpful or inspirational. I received this book as a Christmas gift and was skeptical of it, but decided to give it a chance. Instead of giving me good advice on "getting a life" it gave me literal advice, i.e. how to make your bed, how to take a shower, telling me to make a schedule, etc. I really can't figure out who would need this advice. I was hoping for information on how to feel less like a drooling idiot and feel more connected at the end of a day filled with housework, cooking, Dora the Explorer, frazzled nerves from my 2 year-old and a husband who does't appreciate how hard I work. Instead I wasted the little time I had to myself by reading this simplistic and obvious (yeah I have showering mastered by now) advice.  The authors suggest getting a journal and writing in it and they give you exercises to write about. However the authors never give you any idea about what your writings mean. I guess it's meant to be reflective for each journalist, but I'm still confused as how this is supposed to help me.   I'm pretty sure the authors were stay-at-home-moms who needed some cash so they jumped on the "let's write a book" bandwagon, unfortunately there is really no depth or substance to this book. Save your $15 and buy yourself something - you'll get more satisfaction out of it 
 Why waste your time and money?  Based on this book's standards, just buy anything by a British artist or on a British label and you are sure to have a complete three-star CD collection.  What source are you left with?  Listen to a lot of versions of a given work(for example in public libraries)and decide what kind of approach you like.  You might find out that your tastes are not those of elder conservative British gentlemen 
 Dosn't work.  Still receving lots of auto-dialer calls.  Waste of money 
 I spent all day yesterday reading "I'm Watching You," but I regret having done so.  First, there are way too many characters (about 20) to keep straight.  Second, [...]  Third, the last 20 pages wrap up everything very quickly, giving necessary background information which should have been incorporated more smoothly.  Fourth, Kristen (the heroine) is stupidly stubborn, insisting that the murderer "will not drive her out of her house."  [...]  No, Kristen will not leave.  (Nor apparently will she buy shades).  Even when she has to have a 24 hour police guard, plus the hero (and later, his father) keeping watch,  Kristen will not leave her house.  This stupid  contrivance exists just to put her in danger.  I got very tired of the many times that she fought off various people who wanted to kill her.  To complete her status as a character who is Too Stupid to Live, is her uninformed assumption about the seriousness of the effects of surgery.  (Yes, I bet you can figure the effect of this too).  A gifted artist who is now a dedicated, articulate, principled prosector never has this assumption verified, even fearing it will end her engagement to the hero?  Yeah, sure.  Yes, "I'm Watching You"  is a page turner, but I found it to be very unpleasant.  Even skipping the explicitly violent parts, I found this book increasingly nasty.  [... 
 How come someone as educated as mr. graham endeavors to write a book on a subject that any high school sophomore could have done, maybe better, what purpose did it serve. Any nonmember with an IQ of sixty or above knows pretty much all that is talked about in this book...its no revelation.  mr graham goes undercover as a bus boy at an exclusive club, gets treated like what is to be expected then he is shocked and writes about the results...., or is he.  He should stop waisting time and buy his way into the club, then not drain our intellectual capacity with mindless research and rehashed social talk.  Ok, only purchase if your head is in the sand or you failed to enlighten your kids before they left the nest 
 While the writing was acceptable, I felt that the juxtaposition of the classes in this novel was very forced.  The differnce between the classes is too obvious.  The contrast between the rich world (the students in the Wilcox school and the Cornhills) and the streets of London (and Isa's forced marriage to the grocer, and Mrs. Cornhill's predictable and obvious snobbery) was not one that led me to feel any of the injustice.  I was left cold by the overall plot.  One thing that truly bothered me was the fate of Mr. Cornhill and Isa.  I felt that the way it happened in the book left something to be desired, and was not in true Bronte style.  The characters and their development also left something to be desired.  They were too predictable at times, and Mr. Ellin was just annoying.  There were few occasions when I sympathized with any character, other than Isa (and only at certain points in the plot). There was nothing spectacular about this novel, though I won't discourage anyone from reading it.  It was fast paced and it did hold my interest.  
 I bought this book for research for a novel, and am not overly impressed with it.  She seems to believe just about everything she is handed, with a lot of "imagine if...!" type of space wasting speculation,not terribly interesting.  Additionally, the writing reflects this breathless viewpoint and is over the top with a lot of exclamation points.  She could have used an editor to tone down much of this bad writing, which only detracts from an already weak starting point.  Some of the stories were interesting but much of what is in here takes rather a stretch to believe a supernatural influence, and ultimately I didn't find it terribly convincing 
 This book was first published in 1981, but later edited and republished with a new title in 1984.  The author was clearly influenced to change the direction of this book from the first printing because of his contact with YWAM, John Dawson, Richard Twiss, Daniel Kikawa and others who are hawking these same ideas.  Any good Christian anthropologist will tell you that history shows that, though most Gentile cultures had some sort of "supreme being" they worshipped, those "supreme beings" were one god among a pantheon of gods.  The Bible is clear that "from the creation of the world" all Gentile cultures had corrupted the knowledge of the true God.  Though the first printing of this book had some good ideas about cross-cultural methods to preach the Gospel to many cultures, the additions to this book prove clearly that it is unbiblical in its basic premise.  The new title "Eternity In Their Hearts: Startling Evidence of Belief in the One True God in Hundreds of Cultures Throughout the World" is an unbiblical statement.  Why do I say that?  Two verses end Richardson's unbiblical speculations:  Eph. 2:11-13  Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of  men)-remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now inChrist Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. Rom. 10:14-15  How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news! 
 I have two Lexmark printers and have the same "clogged, but not empty" cartridge problem.  Not only are the cartridges over-priced, but their customer service is TERRIBLE!!  I have contacted them several times RE: the above problem and they tell me that no one else ever has this kind of problem and they assure me that they sell a quality product.  Obviously not!  Maybe we need to form an organized group of some kind to make Lexmark realize that they do have a faulty product and they do have unhappy customers!!  DON'T BUY LEXMARK! 
 Although written in a conversational style, it wasn't a very interesting converstion.  I would have preferred more depth.  The title and (especially) Campolo's praise were highly misleading.  Perhaps the occasional anti-American comments soured my opinion a tad.  As another reviewer stated, I wanted more meat and less side dishes.  Overall, sorry I spent the time reading it 
 The prose in this book is so convoluted and each point takes so long to develop that you'll be soon asleep.   What's worse, the book is neither a solid academic overview of the field nor is it a useful handbook for the practitioner.    Rossi and his co-authors make many attempts to give us the grand theoretical frameworks but they quickly get lost in qualifying themselves into a tepid soup in which nothing is ever black or white, hot or cold, true or false.     Although there are some capsule summaries and references to real programmes, these callouts are helpful only to break the tedium.  They are not presented in sufficient detail that normal people could ever learn from them.  There is never any clear instruction about how one should begin an evaluation or how one should proceed.    Possibly this book is useful for an intermediate-to-advanced evaluation practitioner who is interested in comparing his broad generalizations with Rossi's.   
 Too dark, scattered, and depressing for my taste.  
 Firefighter is ranked more stressful than nursing?  Puhleeze! I've seen veteran firefighters crumble under the pressure of a moderately busy ER...  This book just perpetuates the...we are fed by the media.  The author should do himself a favor and actually STUDY some of the  research done about burnout levels and job satisfaction among the various professions.  The would be purchaser could do better for themself without buying this book 
 This is a package of two double-sided DVD's that contain four films: Hand to hand combat, Close quarters battle, knife fighting and sniper shooting techniques. The film features a bunch of people dressed in green jumpsuits, claiming to be ex-SEALs, teaching you some of their "fighting secrets". At the beginning of each film, there is a disclaimer that states that these techniques or training methods do not represent the policies, procedures or training methods and philosophies of U.S. Navy of navy SEALs. So there you go, this is not a training film of navy SEAL techniques.  The H2H -film introduces some unarmed combat techniques and principles. There are some good principles taught, although they are not very advanced in nature. There is not anything wrong with the techniques, but they don't make up any self defence system, rather they are individual techniques. And they are not taught properly, only demonstrated. As these techniques are very basics, if you have some backround in martial arts, there shouldn't be anything new to you. And if you don't have any previous experience, it's very hard to grasp the techniques based on the teaching in this film. And to top it off, some of the techniques are not very realistic for a normal citizen, like prisoner handling techniques. Run time for H2H film: 0:46  In the close quarter battle -film they show how they train people in Combative Concepts, Inc. They do not teach how to do these things, rather they just tell how they train. So, there is not very much useful information in the film. And this information is not of any use for a SEAL enthusiast, either, as these training concepts do not represents those used by real SEAL units. There are some mildly interesting film clips from force on force training scenarios, but they do not show a complete training scenario. There is also a chapter where a highway patrol officer tells about his recent gunfight, which is the most interesting part in the film. Run time for CQB film: 1:03.  The knife fighting film is the best of the lot, but still that does not tell you very much. There is some interesting, and even useful information presented, but as with other subjects, they are really not instructed at all. There is discussion about defending against knife attack with using a knife, stick, improvised weapons or bare hands, but all are handled really superficially. Some of the defences were somewhat flashy, but not "Murphy-proof", meaning that if you miss your block, you are totally vulnerable to the attacker. There is also instruction on how to attack with a knife. Although brief, this was the most interesting part of the film. For some reason, there was some commentary by Ken Good and Dave Maynard (the directors of Combative Concepts), although they were not instructors in this film. Run time for the knife film: 0:58.  The sniper film opens with a long dramatized scene from a rescue mission. This dramatization continues throughout the film, with short scenes between chapters. These scenes total about 15-20 minutes. The instructional film gives very basic and/or superficial information from several aspects of long range sniping, starting from the basics of establishing a shooting platform, to estimating the effects of temperature on accuracy. Some of the information is misleading or flawed in addition of being severely lacking in detail. For example, information on making range estimations is based to the fact that an average man is 2 meters (6 feet 6 ½ inches) tall! That makes an error of over 10% to start with. Run time for sniper film: 1:27.  This film might be of interest for pre-adolescent SEAL wannabes, but others should stay away from this product. The best thing about this film is the price (it's just about the only good thing), but when you consider you waste four hours from your life by watching the films, it's not worth it 
 Mxpx were solidly putting out great albums. They were in between an underground and mainstream band for a little while. I mean they're on a major label but their songs dont get played that much on the radio and they don't sell millions of albums. They probably sell almost as much as Nofx, pennywise, no use for a name bands like that. This album is better than the new piece of crap they put out a year ago but man not by much, this is actually going away from their punk roots and into more just straight up rock n roll like foo fighters. there are some good songs on here but there are alot of songs that sound the same and are startinig to sound kinda whiny. Mxpx is on a hunt to sell out so buy as many of their records as possible so they can start putting out better albums even though i don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon 
 I was looking for a book that would give me guidance to diet, not one that was meant to analysis my feelings like going to a head doctor. It was a  real disappointment and a waste of my hard earned money. Other books by the  Heller's are of more benefit 
 This book is not for everyone that's for sure. It seems to have an exhaustive list of words that it covers but it doesn't give you any details of their meanings. Although it very briefly, and I do mean breifly, defines  a few words it seems to be more of a thesaurus than anything else. Also  there are no graphics at all. Not so much as a drawing. So if you want more  than wham bam thank you mam then look elsewhere. Other than that. Go ahead  and have fun. Knock yourself out 
 Noam hates the western world all the while living in america and enjoying the conforts of western civilization. Maybe he should live in a communist country to get some perspective on what his ideas amount to.  Some people have told that I dont really know what I am talking about here. I can only recommend them to read what Noam wrote about Cuba. Hope to see you there Noam 
 The book claims you can build all projects with standard components. However, every project contains at least one component that can only be ordered on the website of the author! No details about those components is provided to force you to buy it in his shop and make it almost impossible to find it somewhere else. Also, the claim that all projects can be built for less than 100$ is an outright lie! Most projects are very expensive. I can be very brief about this book. Don't buy it! It's just an advertisement folder for his own company disguised as a book. Besides, every project in it can be found in one form or another on the internet for free 
 I still have not received the product ordered yet, so I am unable to rate at this time.  I knew it would be late, but hoped it would be here by now.  It is a very late gift at this point.  
 I purchased this book hoping for some artistic pictures such as might be suitable for framing.  What I found instead is a jumble of photos that are anything but.  A completely disappointing collection at best 
 The subtitle is very misleading.Having lived in New England, I love it as much as anyone, but to say the recipes come from across the country is a misrepresentation. Ninety-five percent of the recipes are from NH,CT,and NY. There are a couple from CA and one from another state, but that is it. The recipes are fine, but certainly not what I expected 
 i've read psychopath, denial, and now projection. psychopath was a modestly entertaining mystery. i have to say i strongly disagree with ablow's philosophical stance regarding society's and juries' responses to criminal pathology. he is astonishing in his capacity to excuse, even at the cost of more human life. after projection, i've decided i will not read another ablow novel. the plot is very weak, the gore is excessive for my taste, and at this point, the lead character, frank clevenger, is substantially ethically compromised and often criminal in his own actions. when clevenger, a forensic psychiatrist with serious addictive and psychological debilitation, appears on the scene, the body count shoots high. finally, i'm tired of the 'hooker with a heart of gold' stock character. it's pedestrian. life is a bit more complicated. i was looking for depth when i came upon this writer, especially given his background. what i found are weak polemics, psych 101 content, seriously implausible plotting, and emotionally manipulative denouement. it's time to put clevenger behind bars, the general population will be safer. 
 This latest translation of the Chinese Taoist Classic is a dry and lifeless specimen, not surprising from a man whose translation of the I Ching was praised for "having no truck with 'timeless wisdom.'" (back cover blurb).  This volume's claim to fame, beyond its slim and attractive appearance, is the complete translation of Wang Bi, a 23 year old commentator from 3rd century CE China.  To determine whether this translation is for you, you should know that Wang Bi had a strong inclination toward political interpretation, a proclivity probably due to the "high official status and prestige" of his family and their role in government and politics [p. 9], a trend furthered by his great-uncle's "Treatise on Keeping One's Person Safe"-which begins by making government secure [p. 10].  (Now there's a Chinese virtue, eh?)  Consider also Wang Bi's answer as to why Confucius never spoke of nothingness while Lao Tzu spoke of it incessantly (as the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things etc.):  "The Sage [Confucius] embodied nothingness so he also knew that it could not be explained in words....Master Lao...constantly discussed nothingness...for what he said about it always fell short [p. 12]."   Now if you believe that someone who could say that actually knew anything firsthand about the Tao, then this book is for you.  And if you are interested in Wang Bi, see Ellen Chen's superb translation/commentary which puts it in perspective.  Otherwise, this is a book on Te-social virtue-where the scholarship is impeccable and the feeling is weak.  And that's the Way it is 
 As big a fan as I am of Keith Jarrett, frankly this record is one of my least favorite.  Admittedly, it was an experiment of the type you would expect from ECM; but it doesn't work for me.  There are sections when Jarrett just plays his keyboard unfettered and these are interesting and enjoyable.  The saxophonist, Jan Garbarek, however seems to be an acquired taste-his horn sounds like a loon across a frozen lake.  Be that as it may, I didn't enjoy his solos as I normally would any other sax man.   The normally dependable Charlie Haden is almost inaudible here.   I especially could do without the string orchestra that pops up constantly.    Nevertheless, I suppose one has to take this record for what it is:  an experiment in a style Jarrett did not go back to.  My own brother swears by this record.  I swear at it. 
 Harlen Coben is an fabulous writer and I usually adore listening to his books on CD. But Promise Me was a difficult listen because of the reader. When I checked to see who the reader was, it was Coben himself! Coben should stick to writing and have his books read by actors 
 Splendid actress Judi, but she's no Lady Macbeth. Judith Anderson got it right! McKellen wanders about helplessly 
 Ricardo, gimme a break! Amazing as it was, the Aztec empire was not as advanced as Europe. To believe otherwise is to delude yourself into a resentful fantasy that'll only embitter and do you no good. Had Pericles fought the Mexicas two thousand years before Cortés, he would've won just the same because the Aztecs didn't even have the wheel! They didn't know how to forge metals, or plow a field. They didn't know how to travel by sea or sail in a lake. And they weren't any kinder to the peoples they conquered. Any tribe was Chichimeca ("children of dogs") to them, and treated accordingly. That's why Cortés made so many allies overnight.   That's not to say the Aztecs were inferior. Compared with the Navajos, the Sioux, the Apache, and the rest of the Chichimeca, they were a world power in their own right. But compared against Spain they were not, And Spain was on its way out, too! So what? Tough luck! Welcome to History; that's what it's all about!  And sure, the Aztecs DID perform human sacrifices; it's a ritual depicted in most of their códices. Were they any worse than the Europeans? No. Were they "intelectually superior" to them? Nope again. They weren't as developed a society as Europe was, that's all. Live with it!   "What is past is prologue". Don't waste you energy trying to deny the past, work to better the future. And please spare us your spiteful rants; we Mexicans have enough troubles as it is right now to be branded "fascists" as well 
   In the Thirties in the USSR Ms. Piercy would have been a Stalinist hack. This is the most slavish and trite abasement of Jewish tradition to PC platitudes that I have ever seen. For a so-called 'poet' there isn't the slightst trace of history, collective memory and awe that has always infused the Passover, even for the barely observant Jew.  It is deeply offensive and truly revolting.  It is like reading bumper stickers. If this is the 'only seder some marginal Jews can tolerate' I wish they'd stay away from the table 
 No George Harrison, but Milli Vanilli and Paula Adbuhl? This just goes to show you what a joke Rolling Stone has become. Looking at the publication date they omitted George Harrison after his death. What insensitivity, compounded by the fact that he was one of the Beatles to which credit is certainly due for helping to exist a culutre that a magazine like Rolling Stone started as a result of, and certainly thrived from.  Rolling Stone has lost most of what little respect I have for them anymore. 
 Werner Keller was a journalist who was enamored with biblical studies and turned his attention to archeology as a result of the burgeoning area in the late 40s (Dead Sea Scrolls, Nag Hammadi, etc.). The result was this book wherein Keller unashamedly declares - "The Bible is right after all." (p. xviii). He then proceeds to show us.  The book itself is well written and shows more than a little scholarship. He covers 4000 years of biblical history and he tries to integrate archeology with bible quotes and reference works, mostly from the 19th Century.  Yet the book is deeply flawed by Keller's desire to have everything validate the bible's positions. For example, he tries to show that Luke's dating of the census was not entirely incorrect since Quirinius had been in Palestine sometime "between 10 and 7 BC" (p. 344). Yet every scholar who has studied the issue claims that the census in 6 AD was the first census, so Quirinius' presence in Palestine in 8 BC is irrelevant. He spends an exhaustive amount of time detailing the history of the "Star of Bethlehem" and "proving" that the wise men would have arrived to see Jesus in December 7 BC. Then in the next breath he concludes that Jesus must have been born "before the onset of winter" (p. 354). In no case does he seem to realize that the "wise men", if they existed at all, came 2 years after Jesus' birth which is why Herod had all the children, 2 years or younger, slain. Or consider his remarks about the "one-time splendid synagogue" (p. 364) found in Capernaum. In fact, what is there is a public bulding of some sort, but there is no evidence that it was a synagogue until the 3rd Century.  You know that anyone who refers to Josephus as a "trusty historian" (p. 356) hasn't really done his homework.  It's a shame that Keller's theologically biases make a lot of the material unusable. This book can be dangerous if read by a person who is unable to separate fact from theology. Which is unfortunate because it does have a lot of good information and it is well written 
 I have to agree with the first reviewer.  I loved Making the Connection.  I expected a lot more from this book than what I got.  Instead of going more in depth, it's more superficial than MTC.  In many cases, I felt like  he was just repeating his message from the first book, not offering  additional insight.  I'll never get rid of my copy of MTC, but KTC may end  up going to the used book store 
 Better skip the reader's reviews and try another book. This one is far worse than it's rated there. I tried it for what I believed it would entertain me, but it did not 
 "The Last River - The Tragic Race for Shangri-la".......Tragic. Yes I'd agree that this book is tragic. Tragic that I bothered reading it.....tragic that I paid for it in order to read it.....tragic that Todd wasted his time writing it......tragic that I disliked it so much that I can be bothered writing a review. The warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket. "Advance praise for The Last River" it reads. In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it. It seems that Todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal. So much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it. This was my third Tsango experience. I do recommend the Outside documentary on the Lindgren expedition. "Hell or High Water" is not outstanding, but is worth a read, but on this book, my advise to Todd is please make this the Last River that you drag through the wringer 
 Do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20-30 days of the shipping date.  (The receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days.) You don't have much time to return an item, and the company does not give any leeway for Christmas orders.  I am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room, and I can't exchange it for another item because he didn't like any of their products.  
 I totally agree with Amit's review.  For a practitioner's perspective Bruce Tuckman's "Fixed Income Securities: Tools for Today's Markets" is a much better choice than Fabozzi 
 As far as we know, there is still only one universe that we can observe by  our instruments.  What is the evidence for the supposedly 10^500 other universes that we cannot observe?  Hint: they are unobservable.  The landscape problem was a by-product of the Super String Theory that was unable to make consistent predictions about our universe.  Perhaps it is not so super after all.  Susskind should delay publications claiming unobservable worlds until there are evidence of just observing one other universe that is not of our own.  If there are indeed 10^500 worlds around, that should not be so difficult 
 It wasn't as fluffy or thick as expected, and the colour was more blue than purple (which didn't measure up to the image as well). I could get a WAY better quality target for the same price at Target (which i finally did!) 
 These calipers are not up to any form of reliable measurement, because its premise is far too simple.  The instructions include no equations of any kind, and the pinch is intended only for the abdominal skin-fold.  Once you measure the skinfold, you take the result (in millimeters) and compare to a color-coded chart which pairs a man/woman's age and measurement to show the bodyfat percentage within the colored stripes of (ideal, overweight, obese, etc.).  This is too simple for a bodyfat measurement.  There was no regard for body weight, height, or other skin-fold areas.  It would have been nice if the instructions at least included equations so that I could measure myself more accurately on my own--but, no.  Granted, the "click" feature is pretty cool, and lets you know exactly how much pressure to apply while measuring.  However, if you're a trainer or someone seriously trying to lose body fat and measure your progress, you'll need normal calipers with formulas.  This is too basic.  A toy 
 I found the film was poorly directed and photographed. It didnt have a good flow to it. The Duke saves an otherwise poor movie 
 Not enough information about the popular culture or nightlife to really absorb the lifestyle of Cariocas. For such a complex and exciting city, this book offers basic, conventional information, some of which is out dated and few photos or illustrations. ...This book gives me the yawns. I recommend Rio for Partiers (even if you are not twenty-something)to get excited about traveling to Rio de Janeiro, one of the most gifted cities in the world 
 As a 57-year old dedicated Beatles fan since 1963, I listen some Beatles songs everyday 365 days a year. UNLIKE the ANTHOLOGY DVDs and VHS VIDEOS, these ANTHOLOGY MUSIC CDs ARE 100% DISTORTED WORTHLESS CRAP BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN UNFINISHED SONGS FULL OF MISTAKES of the BEATLES PRACTICE DEMO RECORDINGS and EXHIBIT NONE OF THE BEATLES CREATIVE MUSIC GENIUS FOUND ON ORIGINAL ALBUM'S FINAL RECORDINGS.    
 this book is very helpful for both of us,we love to read this book together and try everything they mention...lots of fun 
 I tried to like this novel because as one who believes in predestination, I thought it would show some of the opposing arguments in fictional form; it failed to do this.  James Hogg merely shows us a deranged human being (nothing new there!) who murders because he feels that he is 'destined for heaven' no matter what he does. Yes, he might have been saved from the fires of hell, but it would have been by God's grace, not by his own good or evil works. Isn't this what the New Testament is all about-grace in spite of man's evil doing? Whether one is predestined or 'chooses good or evil' makes no difference in the end-what matters is who saves you from your own mortal destiny which is death. This story fails to show any unique theological and/or psychological perspective. I was dissatisfied with the author's far-fetched and anti-logical presentation of a doctrine he clearly did not understand. 
 I got this camera when it was rather new. I am not extremely pleased with it. It is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it. -first of all...it has no lens cover so you HAVE to keep it in a camera bag. Incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined. -It takes for ever to take a picture. You have to wait for like  2 seconds for the picture to be taken. -It eats up batteries like crazy -It takes forever to turn on -If you have the flash setting on autoflash, the camera will still flash in bright sunlight -The pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home -It has no optical zoom (but the zoom is really the customer's choice. 
 This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon.com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working. When I contacted Palm they told the warranty does not cover keyboard failure then I called T-mobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset. Still didn't work. I called back on satuday 02/04/2006, Palm told me that I have to send them the unit for repaire or pay $25 to get a "premium exchange option" and that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day. I called back on the following Wednesday palm said to wait untill Friday.Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday. I asked to be refunded my $25 because they lied on the terms, the operator said that she could not 
 I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book.  I normally love Katie MacAlisters books, they are amusing and have something new even if she does have to rip off the whole Dark Ones thing.  Jennifer Ashely's story was ok, at least her cheesiness is part of the storyline.  But Minda Webber's contribution, I can't even get through.  If it's not a pun or some trite cliche about vamps, werewolves etc. on every page, it's her mama's trite colloquialisms.  Then Val, the main character would think something and the very next paragraph Lucy would say something stupid about knowing how he feels about something he just thought.  Or Lucy would think one of her trite thoughts and then Val would say in an admiring way something using the same words, Ugh, awful.  And the maturity level of the writing and the characters....it's one thing to say over and over how immature Lucy is, but Val's just as bad.  Some of the situations they are in are straight out of high school.  Everything is overeacted to, Val either hisses or says something savagely.  Always at the wrong time and Lucy has absolutely no impules control.  I couldn't even dredge up any kind of sympathy or empathy or itty bitty liking for these characters.  What a train wreck 
 It is difficult to give this book a critical look because it has become as unquestioned as the Bible is in certain circles.  According to the author the Vietnamese are unknown and unknowable to westerners. (Somehow she has grasped their elemental essence.) They share so little in common with the rest of humanity that Stalinist communism is the only political system under which they will prosper and be true to their anthropological roots.  "The moment has arrived for the narrow flame of revolution to cleanse the lake of Vietnamese society from the corruption and disorder of the American war.  It will have to come, for it is the only way the Vietnamese of the south can restore their country and their history to themselves."  As it has been seen by the eyes of the world through the history of Southeast Asia since 1975 the South Vietnamese were truly fortunate to have been "liberated" and "brought back to their heritage" by a force as truly benevolent and peaceful as the government of the "Democratic Republic of Vietnam."  Overly academic in an elitist anti-anticommunist way, this book has been required reading in all "revisionist" undergraduate history seminars and lectures since its first publication in 1972. (What was "revisionist" in the 1970s is the Very Truth in 2005.) It has the obligitory academic but irrelevant references to "dead white men" (Shakespeare's Tempest) for mostly incomprehensible reasons.  As I watch the people of Vietnam being pimped by their government to enrich its coffers and those of the Nike Corporation, I think of how stupid, ignorant and ultimately vile this book is and was.  As I watch the diaspora of Vietnam succeed and prosper I wonder how Frances Fitzgerald can sleep for all of their brothers and sisters left behind in that unfortunate and misjudged land. For all of its damage done it is regrettable that this book was not the end of Frances Fitzgerald's career, but its beginning 
 I have since raised the score a bit on this DVD although I still can't recommend it except for the curious.  So, notwithstanding the bump-ups on some of the categories below.  I have not disturbed the headline to this review.  I have given scores 1.0 to 10.00, the latter corresponding to perfection.    DVD Video: 3.0 - dull transfer of shabby 1986 Soviet Production is blurry, grainy, and shoddily directed.   DVD Audio: 2.0 - has a very annoying tape hiss that can be very distracting during the quieter numbers.   Production: 0.00 - Dull and way dated.  Probably unchanged since the first production.  Ideologically this makes sense I guess because Swan Lake was created for this company, now calling itself the Kirov.  Unfortunately, the choreography is rote and too willing to cling to orthodoxy.  This amounts to something entirely uninteresting to look at. The worst thing about it is that it seems there was no effort to justify this recorded performance, which is decidedly contrary to just about every other Swan Lake available on DVD.  Examples include the over-prominence of mime and the relative aimlessness of the principle male dancer.    Galina Mezentseva (Odette/Odile): 8.5 - I have revised my opinion on Ms. Mezentseva's dancing.  On further viewings, I found her technique to be precise and moving.  Still, it's hard to believe in her performance. She just doesn't seem to be into it, a situation that I believe is consistent to the cold war image of what Russian life was like - ideological and intensely dull (an oxymoron but accurate).  Konstantin Zaklinsky (Prince Siegfried): 4.5 - KZ was probably a pretty good dancer in 1986: good looking, nice long legs;the problem is, he doesn't get to do anything with them (he has one bit in Act III where he gets to do a once-around with grand jettes (impressive).  That's basically the only moment he's allowed to shine.  But he's a decent partner.  He seemed mostly bored.  Corps:  8.0. - Pretty solid in a late soviet-era sort of way.  Lots of technique.  Little joy.  Orchestra:  3.0 - The violin soloist in the Act II pas de deux is quite moving.  Best I've ever heard on this music.  Ditto some of the wind soloists.  The rest of the orchestra is little more than passable.      DVD content - 0.00.  Herein lies the single most annoying thing:  This package contains ZERO information (in English), on the case, the insert, or on the DVD itself, apart from the names of the two principles.  No mention is made of what the name of the orchestra is, who conducts, what year the production was made.  Some of this information is available in the end-credits, but it's in Russian, so...  I gathered from my very humble ability to sound out Russian characters that the Academy Orchestra of the Kirov Opera/Ballet was conducted by Yevgeny something-or-other.  There is really no excuse for this DVD with the possible exception of Mezentseva who has great technique but doesn't connect very smoothly with the music 
 Enough said.  An utter waste of time and money. This book flows like a bloody glacier. The author barely presents an argument or any direction. Only to be read if you enjoy arbitrary & poorly presented facts of history and grammar to be compared with that of a high school student. I'd rather read The DaVinci Code again, and that's saying something 
 I cannot imagine why a friend gave me this book. Maybe she meant it for my grandmother. This book is scary. It is so dated with rooms crammed with stuff. The same boring, old-fashioned mood runs through it 
 Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.    As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.    The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.    
 I remember reading Johanna Lindsey novels years ago and decided to pick up the Sherring Cross Series.  I watched in dismay, as the books in the series got progressively worse.  Thank goodness this is the last book in this series!  The characters have to overcome obstacles that are not only silly but incredibly unlikely, too.  The fact that the main character has 16 brothers with names as stupid as "Ian One" and "Ian Six" points to too many characters and none of them are well developed.  Even the main characters lack much in the personality department.  Because of this lack of investment, the reader does not truly care what happens to the characters.  If something bad happens, great!  We are that much closer to the end of this book!  I would like to know what happened to Johanna Lindsey when she wrote this book.  Did she have a three book commitment for the series and just came up with something out of nowhere?  Was she behind on her deadline and decided to fill the 300 + pages with dialogue of the same conversations and stupid concerns of 16 brothers?  This book has caused me to have reservations about Johanna Lindsey.  Until this point, I have considered her books to be a great representation of the Romance genre.  
 I guess I'm too far in the hole to wish myself out,best get a lawyer and hire it done 
 I bought this book expecting a long overdue treatment on one of the most dramatic camapigns of the War between the States. Instead what I got was socio-political fluff that quite frankly has been beat over the heads of tens of thousands of college students for over fifty years. Hence the two star rating. It was, however, well written and the battle narrative (the miniscule one provided by Rable) is actually very good, just far too short for a book claiming to be written about the Fredericksburg campaign and battle. Had this not been stocked in the military history section, it would actually pass as great socio-political history. But since many of us have zero interest in that category... well anyway. "New" Military history is quite frankly an attempt to liberalize and propagandize the last bastion of history we have, military history. If all future War between the States and WWII and Napoleonic and Roman military history books turn out this way... just buy the old classics and re-read them. Don't waste your money on New Mil Hist and certainly don't waste your money on this book. It takes the dead horse of Emancipation Proclomation and beats it to past death into carcass mutilation. Again, this book was supposed to be about Fredericksburg Mr. Rable, not the cause of the war to begin with which by the way unfair taxation and import tarrif laws not slavery. Alas, a different subject for a different time.  I repeat... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Buy O'Reilleys instead. 
 Unfortunately I concur with the semtiments of the other reviewers.  I ordered the system based on the writeup in the New York Times.  At least I can save the $40 price by ordering books from Amazon.com.  First, I could not open the CD-ROM, but apparently the program is not useful.  Second, book's main virtue is as a general discussion of book cataloguing and organizing, best suited to a collector of fine books rather than someone (like me) who buys too many and needs to find them at home, rather than duplicating an academic library setting. For the basis of my collection's organization I used The Reader's Catalog.  It works great because of its index to over 40,000 books, a well thought-out plan, and the convenience of being a paperback book with complete bibiographic data on the books. Why type in an ISBN when they are easily available from Amazon or in a book like the Catalog?  
 This book is a poorly-written cry of a book.  Don't wate your time 
 After reading countless poor reviews of the Dolce desk and hutch, I was quite skeptical about ordering it online. ... I gave in and ordered the set from target.com. The desk arrived in almost perfect condition (a few smudges in the stain); however, only half the hutch was in its box! The entire drawer (left side of hutch) was missing, the hardware was missing, and the assembly instructions were missing. ... I recommend calling your local Target store to check the Dolce collection's availability (and the parts inside!) before you waste the time and gas to get there. Aside from the missing hutch, the desk looks really great in my home office. 
 The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others 
 I was kind of upset that Dean Koontz's name did not appear anywhere on this film.  The book was one of the better ones I have read and for the film makers to basically quote word for word from the book without even a mention to Koontz is ridiculous.  They also took out what I thought was one of the best story lines with the other serial killer Roy.  I thought that added a good little side story.  Also, Victor Helios and his creatures were not really explained all that much in the movie.  Randall Six did not appear, and the scenes with Erica weren't that clear.  I don't know, I hope there won't be another movie to tarnish this series of great novels 
 If you're looking for real, useful information on starting a home inspection business, or becoming a better home inspector this book won't help you much. It doesn't take long before you realize the person writing this is not a home inspector. Mostly filler, with very little content. The "how to start your own business" tips can be applied to ANY business & are very basic. I got so frustrated with the lack of information I just stopped reading it 2/3 of the way thru 
 I nearly stopped reading just before the capstone section, where 10 hostages, walled up in a cell, one by one make declarations for posterity before being overcome by nerve gas. I found the book had just become completely implausible.  The characters are intricately drawn, but they are set in a plot that well before that scene is a charade of coincidences. Too many preposterous things happening make any character seem like a cardboard cutout.  What really got me about the gas was that nerve gas exposure, even in mild amounts, makes one restive, excitable, and confused; yet eight out of 10 characters are able to dictate their last words gently and carefully, in cohesive monologues, before succumbing.  The reason why this bothers me is that the author has written a sophisticated book that shows you how terrorists and corrupt spies express their humanity and how the terrible damage that they wreak is played out in the souls of those who were spared. A well-researched and plausible plot grounds the reader in the characters' reality. An outlandish plot renders the characters' actions incomprehensible, because the reader has lost her identification with what the characters would do in that situation. I wonder what would happen if I had lost my parents in a fatal hijacking, as had two of "Due Preparations"' characters; sadly, this implausible novel does not help me answer that question 
 IT WAS FREE WITH A GREAT MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS TOPPER SO, WHY COMPLAIN? NOT THE BEST FOR MY HEAD, HOWEVER, I NEED TO ELEVATE ME FEET WHEN LYING DOWN SO IT'S A COMFORT FOR THAT 
 I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this product. Indeed it does not work on my WinXP PC. The program will not even open and run. The Magellangps.com site has a downloadable patch for the product but it did not work either. What a waste of time and money. If Magellan ever answers my support requests, I hope they will send me a working copy of the program. 
 If the church is our example of marriage Christ LOVED us first. He did not need to be respected first. I agree with the main idea of the book, however the author puts more pressure on women than on men. Men, lead the way in love as Christ did, even when he received no respect but crucifixion 
 Very hard to use, maybe with a lot of practice it would get easier.  Don't buy if you are planning to use immediately.  This is where is I got very discouraged.  Just haven't had the time to play with it so it's sitting in the box 
 You should already know most of the words in this book, but if you feel somebody you know is culturally illiterate and might benefit from these well know words send them one.  I recommend the on-line version for some top notch entertainment 
 I didn't know anything about author Iris Johansen before I picked up "Body of Lies" at the library, but as a thriller fan I thought I'd check out her brand of suspense. About fifty pages into the book I began suspecting that Ms. Johansen had a romance writing past. A check of her bibliography--with early titles like "Lion's Bride" and "The Magnificent Rogue"--confirmed my suspicions. Let me clarify that I have no problem with the romance genre, and Johansen certainly isn't the first romance novelist to make the jump to the thriller genre. But I prefer the thrillers I read to have a bit more edge, and Johansen's prose dulled that edge. Still, I kept reading because the story was intriging and fairly fast-paced. By page 200, though, I was starting to lose patience, and by page 300 my only motivation in finishing the novel was the anticipation of reading something else.  The characters Eve Duncan, her boyfriend Joe Quinn and Eve's adopted daughter Jane weren't terribly interesting to me and often seemed like they were all three the same person. Only the supporting character of Sean Galen seemed to possess any real personality. Too bad, because much of this story is told through dialog, which I don't have a problem with provided it's interesting dialog, but it isn't. Johansen--no Elmore Leonard she--prefers her characters in "Body of Lies" to spout off cliches or give us paragraph upon paragraph of exposition (between gazing, grimacing and moistening their lips, of course). In true detective show fashion, whenever the bad guys are cornered, they fill our heroine in on all their dastardly deeds, saving Eve the trouble of having to work too hard to dig it up on her own. Her story of an underground society of world leaders known only as the Cabal had potential, but it's wasted in this novel. Johansen seems on surer ground when dealing with Eve and Joe's turbulent, if irritating, relationship than political intrigue.  I don't want to be too hard on Johansen. Another disappointed reviewer mentioned her earlier thrillers being superior to this one, so maybe I just caught Iris when she wasn't quite on her game. However, I doubt I'll be reading another one of her books anytime soon. So now I'm going to wipe this grimace off my face, moisten my lips and turn my gaze to a different author.     
 Had high hopes for this record but did not like it.  Apparently there is a reason you used to see it in the used bins: it's just not very good.  Over produced and underperformed.  Blues Image is a lot more interesting.  Ramatam sure looked good on paper though 
 Technology has outpaced this stellar book.  As of November 2006, 78% of all home users had broadband (high speed) internet connections.  Time for a new edition, please 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 When I got this book, I couldn't put it down.  After reading it, I was anxious to get started on setting my goals as Mr Brown described in chapter 16, but I hit a roadblock.  Mr. Brown gives an example of the goal planner, but he didn't show how the math works to get the amount one should save each month.  Mr. Brown even states,  "The following goal-setting forms will serve as a map in guiding you toward your desired financial goals.  They are here to assist you in your planning.  Feel free to use the formula over and over again for your actual desires."  One frustrating problem, Mr. Brown gives NO FORMULAS.  I followed up by going to Mr. Brown's company website and sending an e-mail explaining my frustration, I got a reply telling me to visit the website and click on "need a financial plan."  This requires me to enter in my credit card information and be charged $25 for Mr. Brown to preform the calculations for me (the same calculations that should be outlined in Chapter 16).  In addition, I get a free copy of a book that I just bought.  WHAT?!  I bought this book expecting to be given the tools to be independent when setting up my goals.  Or at least to understand how calculations are made before I seek out professional help.  But Mr Brown only brought me halfway when he suggests ways to set up goals and then in turn doesn't fully explain them. 
 I winced on almost every page of Phayer's book. Historians are paid, presumably, to help us understand well......history,  the perceptions, motivations and issues at play in a prior era. Historical analysis, synthesis and judgments should say something to us about the actual conditions people lived and experienced  -- in doing so an historian is even better positioned to pass the moral judgments Phayer is so addicted to.    In Phayer's book we have no such thing but instead an overblown thesis that Pius XII can only be understood as obsessed with anti-communism and his role as peacemaker. Phayer arrives at his negative judgment on Pius XII largely by anachronism in his analysis, and selectivity and bias in his use (and lack of use) of key references. Considering all the ink that has been spilt over Pius XII, his detractors no longer deserve a pass when they fail to even mention now well documented and thoroughly vetted evidence that disproves parts of the Pius-the-bad-guy thesis. Almost every page is loaded with these errors.   One example will have to suffice. Phayer condemns Pius XII's 1942 Christmas message as weak and ineffectual, "...no one, certainly not the Germans, took it as a protest against their slaughter of the Jews."  Contrast Phayer's assessment to that of a German government report which described the pope's 1942 speech as, "...one long attack on everything we stand for, HERE HE IS CLEARLY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE JEWS [emphasis added] and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals."   There are plenty of other references to the contemporary impact of Pius' 1942 speech, to include the German ambassador, the New York Times and Mussolini's government.  None of that matters to writers like Phayer and his ilk, they are, it must finally be said lousy historians ---- using anachronistic reasoning and blithely ignoring or otherwise suborning evidence that does not meet their prejudiced preconceptions. They are hardly writing history at all, but are themselves mouthpieces for anti-catholicism.   The end result of their endeavors though is transferring blame for the holocaust away from its perpetrators and exploiting the deaths of millions for their personal prejudices.        
 The themes in this story were SO repetitive - I get it already! And there were so many details, they bogged the story down. I found myself skimming in lots of places, and don't feel like I missed anything. 
 To use the speed dial, you must first hold down the button to get the number to be displayed.  Then press phone or spkrphone to send.  I'd say about 80% of the time when I used the phone button I got "number could not be completed as dialed".  If I used the spkrphone button instead it always worked, convincing me that it was the phone button and not something else.  I also had complaints that people couldn't hear me, but only when I was using the headset (which is most of the time).  I use this same headset with other phones, so I'm fairly sure it wasn't the headset.  I returned it for a replacement phone and it had the same problem.  I have to say that amazon has made the whole return process very easy.  Since the second phone exhibits the same problem, I'll get refunded.  I commend their customer service 
 This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie.  
 I bought this book assuming it would give help in dealing with the  alcoholic but was very disappointed.  If you are doing research this book  may be fine, but it is not for self-help 
 This was a gift for my son, who was quite disappointed. It was not what he expected and more than l dvd was damaged.  We had to return it 
 I thought I would love this book...and out of all the viking series I did like it.  But it was poorly written.   I have seen that Ms. Coulter does rewrite some of her novels this is definitely one of them that needs to be reproduced.  She had one to many loopholes that aggravate me as the reader.   I loved Miranda's character.  In my opinion out of all her characters I've read, I've only liked Alexandra Sherbrooke as my ideal woman next to Miranda.   What was disappointing there was not enough more combatative fighting between Miranda and those that kidnapped her nor just a visual between her brother and her.     Secondly with Miranda and Rorik...there was no romance.  I cannot figure how a man moves from detesting the woman to deciding to marry her...although there was a small explanation or round about, mainly Rorik's thoughts on how strong she is and capable.  But besides the romance...the sex scenes were horrid.   It seemed cold and clinical.  There was no passion.   Between Douglas and Alexandra, or even the Legacy/Brides/ and the rest of the Viking sagas..there was some kind of passion that gets you excited and into the hero.  But Rorik was horrid as a lover and poor Miranda just seemed unimpressed..until she decided to take things into her own hands...and then she had to be ill before that was sucessful.  So the quality of romance/passion was utterly lacking in this fic.  My main concerns would be to develop Miranda more and give her a bit more nuances, and expand on her fighting skills with a bit more action.    Another would be to definitely romanticise a bit of the sex scenes at least and give them a bit more loving relationship.  That is not only based on a marriage of convenience.     I think those two would change things a great deal and really improve the book 
 Hurriedly churned out. Pop. Superficial. Still, fun in a sophomoric way. There are many ways one might find enlightenment, even by stubbing your toe. But, stubbing your toe is cheaper, and leaves a longer lasting impression. Beautiful cover art, though. Too bad it doesn't relate to the content 
 The book is as good as the author's web site. Check it out at blarneystone dotcom 
 This Field Guide to the trees found in Pennsylvania is typical of a field guide that is written by an author not intimately familiar with the region.  The range maps are generalized and don't accurately represent the actual distrabution of individual species as would range maps derived from research in herbariums with large amounts of Pennylvania material.  The notes that accompany the descriptions are general and again don't represent an understanding of the details of the state's topography, microclimates, and general forest/woodland/tree distrabution.  Not recommended. 
 I'm sure there are mullahs and ayatollahs who have written why Christianity is a heresy as well.  This book is in that category.  Well, this book and many of it's cohorts argue against Mormonism on the basis that Mormonism "isn't Christian."  Well, it depends on your definition of Christian I suppose.  Mormons profess a belief in Jesus Christ though have a different interpretation of who Christ is and what his death and resurrection means within their respective religions.  Are Mormons Christians?  Frankly I couldn't care less.  The hokey revelations of Joseph Smith are certainly different than the paranoid and delusional revelations of John of Patmos.  As for evidence, there certainly isn't any evidence that Native Americans are transplanted Jews as the Book of Mormon teaches.  Even so, there is no real reliable evidence that a guy named Jesus from Nazareth was crucified and died for the sins of those who believe in him.    I get real nervous when I continue to hear people say "MY RELIGION IS TRUE."  What is "TRUE CHRISTIANITY?"  By looking at the ignorance and dependence that it spreads, I'd say it isn't all that much better than Mormonism.  So let the battle of religious nuts continue on I suppose.  We'll continue to hear terms like "yeah but the babble says" and we'll have people live in a world of ignorance and fear.    I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com  
      This book has some interesting hypotheses but I don't believe it makes the case for the "Rape is the Last-Resort Reproductive Strategy" hypothesis as well as the Ghiglieri book does.  It is known that rape is widespread throughout the animal kingdom, or something resembling mating by forceful coercion at any rate.  I expected to see more of that kind of discussion than just a bunch of old statistics regarding us boring old homo sapiens.  Keep in mind, though, that among humans the majority of rapists are men in their sexually peak years, and the majority of victims are those women in their peak reproductive stages as well.  Sure, there are super-psychos that rape old women, kids or men, for example, but the mere existance of those datapoints do nothing to blunt the force of the evidence in favor of the theory that rape is the last-resort reproductive strategy.  In fact, it is well-known that the majority of rapes that occur: a) are date rapes! and b) an overwhelming number of the victims tend to be college aged women!  Also, let me say that explaining why something happens is NOT the same as justifying it.  Given that Thornhill's wife is actually a rape counselor (!) it would be quite odd if he wrote a book justifying it, to say the least.  What Thornhill and Palmer seek to do is take something that is a norm (yes, a norm!) of human culture, and try and figure out why the hell it's been going on for as long as anybody knows, and why it still is!        I do not believe that there is much scientists or anthropologists can say about a human nature: but they can say that men enjoy forming groups of men to go and kill 'outsiders' (however they may be so designated) (aka "war"); that many youngish men don't mind raping women, and in fact studies have shown that many men are turned on by depictions of rape in movies, magazines, etc; that most men are turned on by lesbian sex, and most women are NOT generally turned on by homosexual sex (i.e., men-on-men); and, finally that people like to congregate in coastal areas to consume cheap alchololic beverages when they have spare time (aka "vacation").  That's about all that can be said about a 'human nature.'        Let me end by noting that even if rape is a reproductive strategy for the lowest of the low- who have no other chance to mate- well, it is a very very UNSUCCESSFUL strategy when compared to normal one of picking up some tramp in a bar; or say, meeting a women around town and having an actual relationship with her, or meeting a girl in HS or college perhaps.  Whatever the case may be, rape is seldom successful in impregnating women, that's why most men don't do it!  In one behavioral ecology study, if I recall correctly, a study on scorpion flies, it was observed that out of 74 scorpion fly 'rapes', or matings that appeared to be forced, only 2 resulted in female scorpion flies being successfully impregnated!  Dung flies also engage some brutal tactics, every bit as brutal as some scumbag beating a women or drugging her drink at a bar or something.      I by no means intend this review to be comprehensive, but only to convey the fact that there is some substance to Thornhill and Palmer's claims, but they do a poor poor job for making their case.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend buying this book, buy Ghiglieri's instead and read Alcock's The Triumph of Sociobiology to get an overall better feel for Thornhill and Palmer's argument.  Finally, however, I believe that one thing that helps us humans out is that we can actually critically evaluate our thoughts and actions: if somebody says, "I couldn't help raping so-and-so, (or maybe just 'random woman')," then I would simply reply: "Take some bloody responsibilty for your actions, of course you could help yourself!"  A dung fly may not be able to decide, based on complex cognitive functions, to not rape a female dung fly, but a man can certainly decide not to rape a woman.  
 This is NOT a 13 cup capacity, it's about 2 cups!  Do not be fooled 
 I really wanted this to work, since my older home has thick walls that make wireless an iffy proposition. However, even with the little blue light that purports to say the signal is great, it isn't. It works at about the same speed as wireless when it works at all, and then without warning drops the signal. And Netgear tech support seemed to know less about the product than I did. After a half hour on the phone the operator I was dealing with said that I should have picked option 3 on the original voice menu (which a pretty confusing menu to begin with). Now the fun begins; getting RMAs to return to two different shippers (both via Amazon), going to UPS, paying to return the products..... not a happy camper. 
 ... for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the "next Riverdance". The dancers are all talented, if self-consciously hip, and in great shape. But the numbers that focus more on T & A than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me. I love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms, but ballroom dance is OTT enough ( if you've ever watched a competition) and doesn't need to be tarted up beyond recognition, the way it is here. Add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess 
 RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN... DO NOT TRY!  Okay, so I bought in to the hype of "Blow Out".  Once I saw the "JONATHAN" product line on the shelf, I thought, "Hmmm, how yummy!"  Boy, was I disappointed.  The moisturizing shampoo was anything but!  The product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue.  Once applied to the hair, I felt knots forming.  Upon rinsing, my hair like it had been stripped!  I used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when I rinsed and felt the "new" texture of my hair.  I couldn't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until I applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  Once dry, my hair felt gritty, brittle and generally nasty.  I'M TAKING THIS STUFF BACK AND DEMANDING A REFUND!  I'm going back to my Frederick Fekkai products immediately 
 To rehash about 2,000 other reviews: this book is tripe.  Worthless.  Offensive to anyone who felt any connection to this series' world and characters.  I think I may have a pretty good idea of what happened, though, and I hope it gives some hope for the future.  It's the Michael Crichton syndrome.  Remember long ago, when Michael Crichton wrote extremely entertaining novels based wholly on his strengths?  He is obviously very bright, and has a real talent for turning ideas about hard-science into fun dramas, like The Andromeda Strain.  Then he became so popular, and so lauded, that he started to believe his own hype.  He read so many reviews of his own books citing him as the greatest writer ever, and as the man whose every word was golden, that he started to believe it.  And so he started to write books filled with what he thought was subtle intrigue, pithy character interaction, and literary depth.  Unfortunately, he wasn't that kind of writer.  He wasn't Delillo, or Dickens, or Wolfe, and he shouldn't have tried to be.  So those books ended up being further towards the 'crappy' end of the spectrum.  Then something happened - I don't know if his editors pulled in the reigns, or if his family sat him down to have a talk, or maybe he started to pay attention to the fans that he was disappointing (I hope).  Whatever it was, it got him to accept a bit of humility, and to go back to his strengths.  The results being Timeline, and then Prey - fun books about hard-science extrapolated into entertaining dramas.  So therein lies my hope for Robert Jordan.  His strengths are in describing an interesting world, in creating things that are mysterious and engaging, and in writing very cool action sequences.  Recently he seems to think he's the next F. Scott Fitzgerald; and failing spectacularly.  He obviously, for example, thinks that he has something deeply important to say about the sexes and about the clash of cultures, and maybe he does, but he sucks at saying it.  More importantly, IT'S NOT WHY WE READ THE WHEEL OF TIME.  If we want to read about the subtleties of culture and its affect on the interactions we have, there's plenty of Dostoevsky available.  Mr. Jordan obviously possesses a stubbornness akin to that he ascribed to the people of the home village of his protagonists (whoever they are anymore).  I just hope that eventually someone will smack him hard enough to wake him up, and we'll find ourselves with another "Eye of the World" or "The Great Hunt" 
 While some of the information was intriguing and new, I was frankly surprised that Mr. Douglas was able to stop patting himelf on the back long enough to type the manuscript.  His ego is enormous, and it is difficult to acknowledge the few original points he makes while he is name-dropping and claiming full credit for assignments that, according to previous reading I have done, were a joint effort.  Some parts of the book bog down, become repetitive and just plain boring. I was glad when it was over 
 I didn't find this text very helpful because it described Aleppo in the eighteenth century using narration.  I didn't feel like the Author had the right to speculate the way he did.  This text was required for a class I took.  At the end of the semester we wrote a research paper, and I found this text to be useless 
 These illustration are mediocre at best and I wish I had realized that they were an artists interpretation of monsters from historical sources, not direct images. Darn 
 What happened to lyricism. I remember back in the days if you had know skill and couldn't rock a party, you got booed off stage. Now all you gotta do is call every chick a b**** and every dude a n***** and you sellin records like crazy. Now I remember NWA used to that, but they had lots of points to get across. Most of these dudes have nothin to say at all. The essence of hip hop is non existent with this trash. I swear I cant believe whats being passed for hip hop these days. Guys like him, D4L, Franchize boys, Khia, Trina and a few more southern rappers set black people back like 2 centuries. If it wasnt for other people playing these albums around me, I would'nt even know most of these crackheads exist 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 This novel deserves 5 stars.  I was given 44 Scotland Street as a Christmas gift. I assumed it was a "detective story" given the author's previous well known work. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was like nothing else I have ever read.  I have lived in Scotland and have visited Jenner's department store in Edninburgh, as well as some of the other landmarks mentioned in the book. I can assure readers who have not been to Edinburgh that the descriptions and the characterizations are very real, for example, the rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow.  Although it may be difficult for non-Scots to fully appreciate certain elements of the book, the characters can be found practically anywhere and in any time. For example, the narcissistic Bruce and the class-conscious Sasha. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and especially homesick Scots.  I can hardly wait for the sequel 
 I read Punk Marketing last week and found it tedious and -- an odd word choice here, but bear with me -- desperate. Two marketing guys labeling themselves "punk" and throwing around lots of slang and casual language, all of it intended to create a kind of "us against them" mentality. It just didn't work for me. Don't these guys know that the least "punk" thing you can do is to call yourself "punk"? Even the book's graphic design, which consists largely of distressed fonts, artfully skewed page numbers and poor illustrations, smacks of desperation. And the prose! Reading this god-awful stuff is like watching an aging hipster chat up a group of hotties at a bar. But here's the real problem with Punk Marketing -- these guys aren't saying anything new, and they're saying it in the most irritating way possible 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 This product wasn't delivered to me for at least 2 1/2 weeks. After one review, the customer service rep from Allergy Be Gone emailed me bribing me to take my review off. He mentioned that Amazon would be reviewing his company, and he didn't want Amazon to see the negative comment. He promised me free filters and offered me a $20 gift certificate if I removed the comment. His name is Jason P, and he goes by judahp for his email account. What a jerk. I will never buy from Allergy Be Gone again 
 I'm a huge fan of Ted Dekkar, but lately I've noticed that his books have been lacking. Showdown was a wonderful read, and I was completely engrossed in it, thinking I would feel the same about SAINT I bought it. I think the most dissapointing about this book was that it was actually a sequel to Showdown, yet you don't know it till halfway through. I found this completely rediculous, and even though the story was somewhat interesting at times, it never really seemed to go anywhere...and never really ended either. There is never any true complete ending, and it leaves you feeling like you read a whole bunch of words instead of an actual story 
 I purchased this book for my 3 year old niece. As I read the story, I came across a sentence that gives a reason for the inability of the giant to catch Jack. Get this... it was because the giant was drunk. Yes... they used the word drunk. I was horrified. What kind of thing is that to read to a small child? I know in today's world children will hear about (or maybe even see) someone being intoxicated. Perhaps this was in the original story of Jack and the Beanstalk; I can't say.  But I will say that I omitted reading that sentence to my niece, removed the book from her things and put the book in the garbage 
    After using an inexpensive Krups machine for 2 years, my wife gave in and we agreed to buy this Delonghi EC701.  The 1st machine we got had a cracked plastic water tank and a broken tray.  DeLonghi customer support is outsourced and worthless andreplacement parts were out of stock and backordered.  We exchanged it for another and the power button did not work-to keep the unit on, you had to physically hold down the power button. Finally, the third machine we got was totally DOA! It wouldn't even turn on.    Finally we were told that they were getting alot of these machines back, and customer service told us to steer clear.  Buyer Beware. We went back to our $50 Krups so far 
 I found this book to be rather dull although I did learn a lot about fox hunting. The description was fabulous but I don't think that it was much of a mystery. I kept reading but I also kept wondering when something was actually going to happen. I did love the character of "Sister" 
 thomas was one of my prof's, but still this book needs some work from a programmers perspective.  there were few hard to understand examples and no clear progression through the book.  good bedtime readin 
 This is the worst shark film i've ever seen. All of the shark attacks in the movie are done with shark fodage. And all of the shark fodage is outa all the Shark Attack films. The directer should be ashamed of himself. And one more thing,the sharks growl just like in Shark Attack 2&3. Do not buy this movie at all! 
 Just to clarify... This man was NOT a mormon or a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saint 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I do not understand why this book is still in print, or at the very least is not published with a huge disclaimer on the front cover.  The author himself has admitted in more recent books (_Blinded by the Right_ and others) that he was *lying* when he wrote this book, and that he deliberately spun every piece of information about Anita Hill to discredit her. 
 This book does not include a very important part of the Atlas framework, the Atlas Control Toolkit.  The book is also padded out with big screenshots etc that make it seem like the author was trying to the page count up to a respectable level rather than using them because they are effective.  I would recomment the atalas website at atlas.asp.net rather than this book 
 This book is the 3rd in a series of "Hinges of History" by the author Thonmas Cahill. For a book about Jesus, the writing style is somewhat cavalier; not unfunny, mind you, but in the context of the discussions, out of place. If the style is somewhat disconcerting, the contents are downright disturbing. This is not a scholarly book. Indeed, it is full of errors and oversights, and on occasion, bad taste. For example...  "Since scholars can no longer consult it [the Aramaic version of Matthew], they have given to this putative source the name "Q"... (p. 75)." Nonsense. The Q document is not the lost version of Matthew.  "Its origins [the Gospel of Matthew]     ...may well lie with such an eyewitness (p. 75)." That's right. Mark and Matthew both wrote their Gospels. And I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.  "Gehenna...pyres were kept burning for this purpose [burning children]. (p. 80)." In fact, Gehenna was a garbage dump and the burning fires were used to dispose of the waste, which included dead people.  "She [Mary] was..no more than fourteen or so... (p. 95)." The fact is no one has any idea how old she was, except that she was a "young woman" and that most Jewish woman in the 1st century BC married at the age of 12.  "...kataluma which means a room occupied by human being. (p. 99)." Yes, but it also can mean a "cave" and there is a wealth of theory and literature supporting the idea that Jesus was born in a cave.  Though this book is not without its merits, you have to wonder what its purpose is. While it is well written, there are much better written books, and while it purports to provide some facts, it hardly ranks even as a weak scholarly text. It provides nothing new, and its rewriting of the old is so full of mistakes that it doesn't warrant reading 
 She starts out slowly to explain the transformation from an individual based responsibility society to one that resolve individual responsibility and blames all woes on the vary society that creates the problem.  A hand full of perverts and commies have taken control of our institutions and perverted the institution's purpose. Sounding like she stumbled upon some great secret and is giving the alarm, this book then quickly turns in to some bitch session that moves from one institution to another. It become very repetitive and offers no solution. She should have stopped when she was ahead.  I haven't heard terms like the deserving and undeserving poor since the re-runs of "My Fair Lady" when Alfred P. Doolittle said "I intend to go on being undeserving".   Maybe it is just that a lot of her descriptions of society are of some place far off or unique and have never made it here. However her descriptions of schools do not match the ones I went to or the local ones that kids are going to today. She must have gone to a different Smithsonian than I did and none of the examples of daily life matches any reality that I have come across.  If the book had a solution section it would be "The Capitalist Manifesto" (a revolutionary plan for a Capitalistic distribution of wealth to preserve our free society) by Louis O. Kelso and Mortimer J. Adler.  This book is the "Turner Diaries" without the story line. I rate it up there with the best of conspiracy theories. If you make it through this book with out wondering what her problem is then be sure to read "None Dare call it Conspiracy" at least there is an attempt to put some meat behind it.  However the book does describe a good nightmare if you can find it. 
 The Causey Book is outdated.  The information included is available online in a more professional format.  A good internet browser will get you more information than this book 
 Alexander Pope was not of the Romantic period, and any book that thinks he was can be no guide to a GRE Subject Test.  This alleged prep text splits hair in nanometers over interpretive questions, asks for identification of the most obscure passages, and frequently explains why B was the right answer, and why A, C, and D were wrong, but leaves that status of E wholly to the realm of mystery.  The practice test sent out with the GRE registration is different in scope, clarity, and difficulty.  I actually tore out a chunk of this book with my teeth in frustration.  Don't buy this book.  Don't even steal it.  Spend the money on deluging the publisher with demands to remove it from the shelves and issue written apologies to anyone who ever suffered themselves to use it 
 The authors give both the ideal of what top executives should be doing and how auditors should be auditing,according to the rules of the market system, then show the changes that took place in these roles in the 1990's and why these changes developed, and the serious consequences the changes have for American businesses.  
 This was very basic and had few examples to choose from when trying to form a letter.  What little guidance received was common knowledge.  This is best suited for high school students 
 Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson (1854) is a short, episodic novel which continuously promises to flower into a small work of genius but never succeeds. Densely packed with socially explosive themes and literary devices--including two apparent sets of twins, switched identities, transvestite episodes, an emotionally biased stepparent, a scheming heir, a dramatic court room scene, and a mysterious murder--the book is too obviously calculated throughout, and thus, despite moments of genuine power, reads like the awkward concoction that it is. Since Pudd'nhead Wilson is essentially plot-driven, Twain's frequent apparent lack of confidence in his narrative doubly dilutes the novel's forward momentum, leaving the reader uncomfortably aware of the author's somewhat forced creative decisions. Even locally misunderstood lawyer Pudd'nhead Wilson himself--a secondary character--never really exists as a three dimensional figure and seems present throughout only to serve as a deus ex machina at the story's conclusion.   All of which is a shame, since Pudd'nhead Wilson, in terms of its themes, had the potential to be Twain's greatest work.  The novel is the story of Roxana, a slave who, being "only one-sixteenth black," can pass for white and who switches her own light-skinned child with the child of her master while both are in infancy, thus hoping to spare him the horrible fate of "being sold down the river." But Roxana's child, now known as "Tom" and raised as the future lord of the manor, becomes a bully, an ingrate, and a secret criminal, while the real heir, raised without any advantages as a slave and called "Chambre," merely fulfills his role as an illiterate piece of property.   The novel's most significant problem is also its most obvious one. Pudd'nhead Wilson would have been far more compelling had Twain not allowed the text to take the overt position that blacks raised as whites will turn out to be as shiftless, loafing, and inherently worthless as the prejudices of the era defined them to be. This is especially true since "Chambre," the genuine white heir, remains offstage for most of the novel and thus his lack of development as a human being under the slave system is never explored.   Nothing hammers Twain's error of judgement home as much as the fact that the initially sympathetic Roxana develops into a morally compromised individual as the story proceeds, not because it is essentially believable for her to become so, but because Twain needs her to falter to further his rather cumbersome plot. Ultimately, that Roxana is only "only one-sixteenth black" and "Tom" "thirty-one parts white" and both thus essentially caucasian, is neither here nor there, since Twain repeatedly reinforces the notions of the era that both remain "negroes" regardless.   Though only 120 pages long, the meandering Pudd'nhead Wilson reads like a book twice that length, and, as its audience will begin to suspect as the narrative progresses, the story's climax is pat and predictable. Twain might have succeeded at leaving his racially charged themes deliciously ambiguous and prismatic, but simply does not. Few things are sadder than a work of art that attempts to be clever and fails to be, of Pudd'nhead Wilson is an fine example.     
 Despite what appears to be the vast majority of opinions on this book, I found this book very difficult to get through. What De Pree writes as "authoritative" leadership concepts, I see as nothing more than common sense. Perhaps I have been blessed to work in a company that touts similar values and beliefs or perhaps I am just a person that already believes that it is the diversity of people that is what makes a company successful. But I found dredging through De Pree's long lists of leadership principles exhaustive and frustrating. I didn't find this book revolutionary (which is how he seems to write it) or even particularly interesting. "Man's Search For Meaning" is a FAR more compelling leadership read... 
 I bought this book since everyone was giving it 5 stars. The first part of the book was o.k., but then, it got into way too much detail. I found the descriptions of the cells, lymphs and technical names for every enzyme pretty boring. I had to make myself finish reading it. Buy it if you want to read every detail of the immune system. If you are like me and need something more basic, look on 
 I had been using the 13th edition of Jeff Hermann's writer's guide. I found it quite useful and relied on the index heavily. Since 2002 many of the addresses were no longer up-to-date. I purchased the 2006 edition to get more recent information. To my dismay I discovered that the 2006 Edition has no index whatever! An 806 page guide with no index is of limited value to me 
 It is a well written book with good instructions but I really did not see any of the project that I would want to build. I think a bit more imagination as well as some ways to dress up the projects would have made the book a bit more useful 
 This book is a wonderful celebration of the strength and lifetime beauty of the some marvelous women.  Their images and insights give encouragement to women of all ages that "the best is yet to come."  This would be a great book for a discussion group.  I first saw it in my doctor's office.  The best part of the book is that it is real 
 I ordered one which never worked, the replacement did not work as well. Water does not come through the filter, strange blinking of the lights. Just big frustration. Otherwise look very nice.   
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 I think this book is very repetitive and is a very poor attempt at showing why losing all of these languages is important.  They are comparing losing these languages to animals and plants going extinct.  They try and draw all of these worthless comparissions that do not make any sense.  This book is not even worth being picked up 
 I think what's annoyed me the most is that Evie has gone from a talented, and exciting person to a major cow. All she seems to care about is herself and her own wants.  And this whole relationship with Daniel made no sense whatsoever.  Daniel as loyal husband just didn't work when one couldn't see the connection between them.  On her side, it all just seemed to be about possession.  On his, who knows?  the acting was weak there.  The rest of it was quite boring.  This series was not gripping like Series 1 and at least half of series 2 (that got annoying with Evie's selfishness again).  And the dialogue in general and the acting was getting more and more stilted and dull 
 The only thing worse than reading _Beloved_ (read my review of the novel) is listening to Morrison read it.  She goes so s - l - o - w - l - y, and seems more impressed with her book than the reader.  Quite frankly this book doesn't really demand this close of a reading.        Although trite to say, the best compliment a writer can have is having someone else make the text come to life, and this audio book is interesting only as an historical artifact.  
 I read exactly half the book and stopped.  Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.  As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!  The book is silly and laughable.  The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.  Really bad 
 Works great for partitioning a hard drive but when it comes to adding another operating system. I've been pulling out my hair. The directions are vague and the customer service stinks. Everything is done with email and if you want to talk to someone it will cost you 29.99 for a one time occurance. Check it out at www.acronis.com . Look around before you buy. If I would have I would have never had bought this product. 
 The Art of M&A Integration is indeed an Art Book. It might help you in choosing your watercolors, but will not teach you how to paint 
 For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms: David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like. This is nonsense. You don't have to agree with the Christian right - I certainly don't - in order to perceive liberal bias in the media. I would give some examples, but I'd probably get censored again 
 I purchased this boombox for my daughter's room.  Basically, we put in a CD at bedtime, and set the sleep timer for 30 minutes.  NOT heavy or detailed use ... I bought this unit because of the timer.  After 3 months, when you push the play button (either remote or manually) the machine would sporadically play the CD.  Usually after 2 or 3 'no disc' errors, and a power shutoff, it would eventually play.  Now it's completely a 'no disc' error message.  Of course, Sony's warranty person explained that it's a 90 day warranty ... imagine that!  A COMPLETE waste of my money.  If I'd have wanted a cheap machine to last a few months, I would have bought one.  I paid extra for this one so it would last!  I'll be hard pressed to buy Sony again!!! 
 This is a foreign film from Cuba. It's a story of a developing friendship between a gay man Diego who enjoys the finer things in life and a young Communist student. A first the student David is repelled by Diego and had to be manipulated to go to Diego's apartment. Slowly, David becomes Diego's buddy and he explores new ways at looking at life. Diego neighbor Nancy gets romantically involved with David.  Truthfully, this movie bored me. I don't care if it got nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture.  
 We borrowed this book from the library because of the joy we find in reading "Where the Wild Things Are", and assume this book would have the same kind of childhood imagination, and also the fact that it received an award.  Yikes! If this is childhood imaginagtion, maybe the makers of horror films should use kids for inspiration.  This book made my son afraid that goblins would steal him away in the night, and that babies might be goblins.  The father is absentee, the mother distant, and the big sister has to care for her baby sister.  Goblins steal the baby away, and the big sister is able to retreive her through some drug-trip-like ritual.  Meanwhile, dad's away and mom's staring off into space in the garden.   Don't read this to your toddler/preschooler/school-age/tween/teen-age kids!! 
 I purchased this book excitedly, because of the paucity of reading material directed at someone like me- a 43 year old, first time mother via infertility treatments, with a long and successful professional career.  Then I started reading, and my excitement deflated.   I don't think she was really committed to anything other than publishing a compilation of forced hilarity sit-com entries.   I thought her style was trying to emulate Ann Lamott....but with the cynical, savvy-New York City angle (Sex-In-the-City with babies and their poo), and without the heart or introspection that make Lamotts "Operating Instructions" so precious.   How does this book represent good writing?   She has not communicated so much to us... her motivation to get pregnant without the support of her husband, the complicated reasons why she has a very unconventional life, why she accepts incompetence from her contractor, why she is cowed by a Nanny.  I suspect it could be more interesting if we, again, got a peak at some real heart here.  Instead we get to read about how much money she can spend (except...well..not on a CRIB or DIAPERS...her friends/family have to come up with that for her after the babies are born), Manalo Blahnick shoes and exquisite catering...its often a very superficial and disappointing read that I basically slogged through. I have no doubt Ms. Newman is a wonderful mother and partner who deeply loves her children and husband...and I would have liked to read about that side of her, and that can be done with humor interfaced with self exploration.   If she had gone just a few shades deeper she could have made a very engaging book for many of us, especially if she was less enamored with her fabulous lifestyle and more committed to an internal journey.   But hey, this is 2005.  We don't ask for depth and character anymore. We're satisfied with a yuk.  
 the DVDs never did reach their destination... which I ordered almost a month ago... 
 This slight book is filled with outrageous factual errors and author's self-promotion. Sergeant's Usonian Houses and Pfeiffer's Select Houses are authoritative sources on the Rosenbaum House; or the National Trust's Usonia.  
 Did Danielle really write this?  It seems like it was written by an adolescent girl.  I thought it might get better but it never did.  I'm glad this was a library book 
 This book was awful.  I read "The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program" (DesMaisons) first, and I was spoiled by more rational, documented approach to the subject.  To be fair, I only got through the first part of this book before I put it down in disgust.  This book is the rantings of someone who feels passionately about something.  Great.  Now back it up.  You can't just  say, "This is bad and you have to do this!"  Well... I suppose you can.  But in my opinion that makes for a lousy book for someone who is trying to learn and separate fact from hysteria 
 I didn't buy my copy off amazon but at the Pan bookshop in the Fulham road where I got an autographed first edition. It'll have good re-sale value. That's the best I can say about it.  Alan Hollinghurst has already proven that he can write, but I was expecting something with alot more depth to it than this. Especially as the Booker judges had rewarded him for it. If you think the BBC adaptation was just giving you a taste of what you'll find in the novel, then you'll be disappointed as there is not much more to the book than was put on screen.            Nick Guest, the novel's central protagonist, moves to London to work at UCL and accepts accomodation from the family of his friend Toby Fedden. Despite Nick and Toby being such good friends Nick has never been to Toby's family home before the novel starts. Nick has a brief relationship with Leo Charles. Leo Charles introduces Nick to a friend of his,Pete, who owned an antique shop and this plot strand ends abruptly as though it was a half thought out idea. I was hoping Leo's family and friends would be drawn more vividly to get us out of the claustrophobia and boredome of the Fedden family home. There's the crux of it. The characters , and what they do here are very boring. It's very dull.           There is a narrowness to the London that Alan depicts. Here he rarely leaves the Fedden's place in Notting Hill, and the variety and changing social status of that area during the period is not described. I know from reading 'The Swimming Pool Library's innacurate description of walking from Mile End to St.Anne's Limehouse that Mr.Hollinghurst's knowledge of London is sketchy at best (he'd get lost east of the City without a guide, and he probably doesn't realise that south of the river is inhabited) but it is irksome to read a novel set in a city you know well and finding it so poorly represented.  You need to get out more, Alan. Try again 
 A sorry example of the laziness and irresponsibility of many trade editors today -- and it's especially shameful in a publication targeted to students and youngsters.  First, the basic text is dreadful: though unidentified, it's the long-discredited translation signed by "Mercier Lewis" and rushed into print in 1872 by the London firm of Sampson, Low. As modern scholars have documented on numerous occasions, Verne's original French was politically censored, drastically abridged, couched in stilted Victorian prose, and riddled with hundreds of inane translating errors. Its clunky, antiquated English is something no American student could possibly enjoy ("I own my heart beat," says the narrator, who actually means, "I admit my heart was pounding"). As for the translating blunders, some are asinine beyond belief -- Verne's characters start a fire with a lentil (Verne: lens) . . . loosen bolts with a key (Verne: wrench) . . . and claim iron is lighter than water (Verne: the opposite, of course).  Are these obscure facts? Anything but. Over the past four decades, this translation's inadequacy has been bemoaned repeatedly in basic reference works (Taves & Michaluk's JULES VERNE ENCYCLOPEDIA), online (the Jules Verne Forum at http://jv.gilead.org.il/forum/), and in readily available MODERN translations of this novel (e.g., the paperback editions from Signet, Oxford, and the U.S. Naval Institute). What's more, not only has Simon & Schuster's current editorial staff shirked the most rudimentary homework, they're apparently too lazy even to double-check their OWN publishing files: as long ago as 1966, S & S issued a revised edition of the Mercier Lewis translation; they hired NYU expert Walter James Miller to correct and reword Lewis's text -- which, in a specially written preface, Miller denounced as a "botched up translation . . . slashed and slapdash." Lewis's renderings, he said, "bristle with technical errors and omit whole passages vital to the technical integrity, the character development, even the humor of the story."  In short, Simon & Schuster could easily have reprinted their own 1966 version, not ideal but vastly better than Lewis's original. Or, alternatively, they could have reprinted either of the other two English translations in the public domain, both superior in accuracy and completeness. But, these days, indolence and ignorance apparently rule in the halls of S & S.   So, though this Enriched Classics series boasts on its back covers about its "practical scholarship," the said scholarship, not surprisingly, often works out to be dismally unreliable. The "helpful notes" and "insightful commentary" can range from the useless to the ridiculous. On p. 425, the explanatory notes can only tell us that such sea creatures as tubipores, gorgones, and spondyles are "various kinds of marine life." Big help. (They're corals, sea fans, and oysters, folks.) On the other hand, when the notes attempt more, they're often worse: on p. 426, for instance, I was amazed to learn that porphitae and asterophytons are "igneous outcrops." Nooo!!! These aren't rocks, people, they're animals! (Jellyfish and starfish, for Lord's sake.)  If you're as astonished as I am that such bluff and nonsense is being palmed off on our kids as "scholarship," write S & S this week.  Meantime, what edition of 20,000 LEAGUES should you acquire? First, in addition to this Enriched Classics version, also avoid those other student editions (!) published by Scholastic, Tor, and Apple -- they don't identify it either, but they all blindly reprint this same hopeless 1872 Mercier Lewis translation. Fortunately, however, there are four sound paperback texts of 20,000 LEAGUES, all readily available, all immeasurably superior in accuracy, completeness, and readablility. For general readers the Bonner (Bantam) and  Brunetti (Signet) translations are both worthwhile. For readers wanting an annotated edition, there are two good ones: Butcher's (Oxford), which is strong on the novel's genesis and manuscript record, and Miller's own illustrated retranslation (U.S. Naval Institute), which is strong on the marine biology -- and on which I myself collaborated. All are competitively priced, so there's no need to settle for something inferior.  By the way, the above-cited deficiencies may well be typical of this Enriched Classics collection as a whole -- I note that their edition of Dumas' MONTE CRISTO also features a seriously inadequate text. Students, parents, and teachers are warned to proceed with caution vis-à-vis the entire series.    
 This book is entirely misleading. Paul Johnson employs one of the dirtiest tricks known to humanity and very common in the political world - he picks a triple handful of intellectuals he doesn't like or disagrees with and digs up the darkest or absurdest material about them he can find.  I would have been a bit more impressed if he had chosen intellects or historical figures he revered and subjected them to the same dirty treatment.  Where are Mr. Johnson's favorite writers, popes, theologians, political philosophers and what all.  But it still would've been a mugs game and not worth much more beyond entertainment value except, perhaps, to affirm what all mature readers ought to know by now - we are all sinners.  Big deal.  Welcome to the real world, folks. Mr. Johnson does a singular disservice by his idiosyncratic use of the word "intellectual" by which he can push forward his smear campagain against intellectuals whose ideas bother him and white wash intellectuals he approves of. His treatment of Evelyn Waugh is absurd.  Mr. Waugh, contra Mr. Johnson, was most definitely an intellectual and he had his own ideas about how the world should be run.  Mr. Johnson does not take seriously Waugh's roster of sins which include an almost overbearing arrogance, the basic innability to admit when he was wrong, discourteousy to friend and foe alike, and a callous and ostentatious flaunting of wealth which would have won him the censure of the writer of the Epistle of James. I'll give Mr. Johnson's tabloid journalism two stars instead of one because it does have its entertainment value. Mere entertainment always has charm especially when wisdom is lacking 
 I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x.  Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner.  So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one 
 Power of Purpose would make a great magazine article, but there is not enough content here to make a good book.  "Creating Meaning in Your Life..." is not what this book is about.  There is lots of talk about  how important it is to have purpose in your life, but little about how to  create it.  Mr. Leider has a great reputation -- it must have come from his  other books 
 Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people

 The 1991 "Our Game" is a standalone post cold war spy story by that British master, John LeCarre: and he's written several memorable spy stories, such as "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold," and the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  This book exhibits some of his virtues as a writer: unsurpassed spycraft, strong set piece openings, and closings; plots that might keep a reader up way past bedtime, sharply drawn characters given snappy dialogue, and engrossing narrative and descriptive writing.  The book opens on Tim Cranmer, forcibly retired British cold war spy; luckily for him, he seems to have more than his share of wealthy relatives,enabling a comfortable retirement as a landed winemaker.  He has acquired a beautiful, much younger mistress whom he keeps in luxury.  And he's been able to place his oldest friend, Larry Pettifer, a friendly rival since Winchester, the elite public school(as the English call it; we call them private schools), and the elite unversity, Oxford, in a job nearby.  Mind you, Pettifer was also one of the deskbound Cranmer's spies, or joes, as Le Carre calls them; he was also a double agent, working for the Russians as well.  Yet there's nobody the cold Cranmer has ever been closer to.  Suddenly, Pettifer disappears, taking with him Cranmer's young mistress Emma. (He tells Cranmer:" You stole my life, I stole your girl.")  Cranmer soon discovers that Pettifer has committed himself to a new cause, for which he's taken with him $37 million Russian that he wasn't entitled to.  Cranmer also soon realizes his former employers at the spy shop suspect him of complicity in the theft; and, what's worse, a ruthless Russsian mafia does, too.  So Cranmer goes on the run, to Paris and Russia, remembering his helpful spycraft all the way, as he looks for Pettifer and Emma, while trying to avoid the parties looking for him.  At one point Cranmer muses: "He /Pettifer/ has been goading me about my indifference to the world's agonies....I have said that I never considered myself responsible for the world's ills, not for causing them, not for curing them.  The world was in my view a jungle overrun with savages, just as it had always been.  Most of its problems were insoluble....I have said that I have always been, and would continue to be, prepared to make sacrifices for my neighbours, compatriots, and friends.  But when it came to saving barbarians from one another in countries no bigger than a letter on the map, I failed to see why I should throw myself into a burning house to rescue a dog I had never cared for in the first place."  Now,unfortunately, readers who find that speech resonant, who perhaps are even saying to themselves some variation of: "Right on, brother, couldn't say it better myself," will have a problem.  Because, for reasons never made entirely clear, Cranmer will suddenly pull a 180 in his beliefs, grab a Kalashnikov rifle, and run off to try to put the world to rights himself.  For such readers, this book might not be the best place to start reading Le Carre.  
 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 I have had to set up a few new installs of the Vista Business on some servers and I was disappointed with the overall performance.   My biggest gripe is when I tried to remotely log in from another PC and I sat there waiting and waiting only to discover that the Vista default setup is to ask permission to run even the most basic operations and was actually sitting there waiting for someone to click 'YES' to allow the process to run. How irritating! Kinda self defeats the idea of remotely logging in doesn't it?.   Also if you happen to rename the administrator account the change is not registered somewhere in the Remote Connections authorization. So when I *thought* I was remotely logging in under the new admin account name Vista wouldn't let me in and it was only after searching for what seemed an eternity - some hidden place it took me 15 minutes to find, I discovered that the the new admin account name had not been authorized when I did the name change. yikes!  For those who need to run VNC Server on Vista, be aware there are issues -  installing and running that you will need to work around as well.   It seems like Microsft drastically changed the menus, overdid the default security features, and installed a new hood ornament. Other than that I don't see what the big deal is. 
 I have had this unit for just over a year.  Beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out.  Because of this design, it is prone to misalign the cd, which will either not load and the "no disc" warning will show or when it does play, there is a significant vibration.  To try to remedy this I had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit!  Alas, I just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime.  It is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a Sony..... By the way, the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor 
 Last month our bookclub discuss this book, and it was very boring.It most was about other sports not  baskekball which was the story. Bruce Brooks write a book that is  exciting . 
 I'd size this book up as one small step beyond a 'welcome to the wonderful world of the dining/wine business' pamphlet you'd pick up at an employment agency or something.  An inconclusive introduction at best.      I bought this book because I have trained as a chef, and because I have a passion for food, but I don't aspire to the life of a chef.  I wanted insight into how to break into alternative divisions of the industry, such as wine, gourmet food, small business ideas, etc.  Such information is not to be found in any useful degree here.  Rather, this book rarely spends more than a half page paragraph under any one heading,  for instance, in describing the various posts within a typical restaurant kitchen, or going into possibilities beyond the restaurant kitchen.     It strikes me that there is virtually nothing in this book that cannot be determined simply by using common sense in thinking about the industry.  So unless you literally know nothing about it, I cannot recommend this book for anyone looking for new ideas or real insight into the food/gourmet genre.  
 Perhaps Puffy only got as far as he could riding on Biggie's legacy, but lets face it, he really has very little talent, charisma, charm and just seems so dull, he is basically a male Paris Hilton, going around acting like the world's biggest d1ck ny saying "look people, I got money, arent I cool" besides Biggie(RIP), Bad Boy really is not great, most of the artists are poor quality, The production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial. This album is basically not even worth printing or existing. It is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like Diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on TV. I don't know why people like Tupac, Biggie, Dimebag, Chuck Shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths. So I would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and D4L deserve, a 1 star rating.     
 This audio CD had me excited at first, at least until I actually played it. It's the most boring read of any story I've ever heard in my life. Golding's a great writer, but he ain't no reader. His own commentary in parts is distracting and irritating. His mouth noises unsettle me, and his slow, dull, expressionless rendering of this classaic grates on the spirit. Too bad an accomplished reader such as Roger Dressler or Garrick Hagon can't do this novel justice. It's just a damned shame is all 
 Not a good book at all the book is missing alot of things and I don't have all day to tell them al 
 This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen. Firstly, this book is putatively "written" by a snotnose who some neo-con writer probably thought would serve as a great marketing schtick. I mean, are we expected to believe that this kid has anything insightful or informative to say about the American media?? C'mon, people, go read McLuhan or something.    Secondly, WHAT LIBERAL MEDIA? As far as I can tell, even the liberals in the media are afraid to "rock the boat." They're ineffectual nothings who haven't practiced truly investigative reporting in decades (except for Seymour Hersch... much props). They operate as a collective unit of nebbishes, but at least they are the conservative media. By the way, Fox News is the number one news channel on cable television, so don't tell me that liberals control the media. There're plenty of people who watch the conservative crap proposing to be news. Wow, the American populace is dumb. THINK, FOLKS, THINK!! (NB: Yes, I'm an angry, but mostly objective, liberal 
 Brannagh's film version of Hamlet blows away every other version, as well as every other Shakespeare based film. It's an easy 5 stars.  Now the DVD is a different matter.  Been hearing about and waiting for this for ages! Every lame-oh shlock film holywood cranks out shows up on DVD and usually big projects like this are milked for every $ they can get with fancy packaging and special editions.    I was part of the project through which a small determined group of fans was able to bring the one season wonder "My So-Called Life" to DVD and there must be close to as large an audience for this.  WHERE IS IT 
 marilyn hickey states that not all christians will make the "1st rapture" as she calls it.  suppose someone became saved one minute before the rapture and hadn't had a chance to perfect his walk.  does that mean he's not going to make the rapture.  the bible says we're all saved by grace so no one can boast.  i just find it hard to believe that not all saved believers will not make the rapture based on their "walk".  that means that God is showing favoritism; which He never does 
 What an odd book.  Shiller reviews the up-sides of multiple forms of insurance without a thought to the down-sides.  How much would being insured for every possible eventuality cost the user?    At times, I tended to agree with the reviewer quoted on the back cover -- 'pleasantly utiopian'.   At other times, I more agreed with my father, who said, after I read aloud a passage about the draconian surveilance measures needed to enforce some of the insurance contracts Shiller advocates:  'He's a very bad man.'   
 I have used these books for about ohh... 4 years now, and since I have started using them my standerdized test scores have droped from just above avrage to well below avrage... I do not believe anyone should use them 
 Even though this is the revised edition, I have been told by professionals in the children's book industry that the information I got from this book is out-of-date and incorrect 
 This assessment of pre-Israel Palestine is best read in tandem with Prof. Yehoshua Porath's article in the spring 2000 issue of Azure. Segev claims here that the British came to rule Palestine with no clear idea of what they wanted. Segev supposes that a well-organized Arab nationalist movement, vigorously opposed to British rule, mounted the murderous Arab "revolt" of 1936-1939 and forced Britain to conclude it had no interest in Palestine and should leave. These ideas are ridiculous.  Why it took the British until 1948 to leave, Segev does not explain. As to voluminous evidence that the British stirred up Arab nationalism and the anti-Semitic revolt and joined in fighting the Arab's first war against Israel (as accounted by Col. R. Meinertzhagen, Samuel Katz, and many others), Segev keeps silent. Nor does he note that British general John Glubb commanded the Transjordanian army.   Segev asks political questions. 1) Why did the British conquer Palestine? 2) Why did they commit in 1917 to establish a Jewish National Home? 3) Why did they stay in Palestine? 4) Why did the British leave?   But Segev derides official British papers as too tiresome and voluminous to read. Segev bases his conclusions entirely on gleanings from diaries, personal letters, articles and books written by local Britons, Arabs and Jews, none previously consulted by historians--probably because they describe the social scene, not politics. The resultant fiction on Mandatory Palestine repeats the old Arnold Toynbee canard that Britain promised Palestine twice.   This conclusion is also ridiculous: Better accounts (which Segev ignores) are provided by scholars like Howard Sachar (History of Israel); Efraim Karsh (Empires of the Sand); Elie Kedourie (In the Anglo-Arab Labyrinth; Chatham House Version); David Fromkin (A Peace to End All Peace) and Conor C. O'Brien (The Siege); Samuel Katz (Battleground) and Bat Ye'or (Islam and Dhimmidtude: Where Civilizations Collide).   The worst aspect of Segev's work is his failure to note that Britain's conquest of Palestine was part of a calculated political and military strategy to establish a land bridge between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. This, the British intended to enable their rapid deployment of troops to the Gulf, defend the Empire's vast East Indian interests, protect their territories from Russian invasion, and to provide an alternative to and protection of Egypt's Suez Canal. Segev claims that "[The British] gave [Palestine] to the Zionists because they loved 'the Jews' even as they loathed them" and feared them. He also posits that the British were guided something other than strategic considerations, and lacked an "orderly decision-making process." (p. 33) Good grief. Even if this were true (which it isn't) Segev hardly disproves the importance of the land bridge as the driving force behind British policy.   Segev also minimizes the importance and effect of Britain's 1939 White Paper, which slowed immigration of Jews to Palestine--mandated by the League of Nation in 1922, with international support--to a trickle. Britain trapped Europe's Jews inside Nazi-controlled Europe, denying them their one viable escape hatch. Segev, however, suggests that the White Paper had no practical result, since even the quota established was not filled. But how could it have been filled, when obtaining papers became so difficult in the aftermath of the White Paper? Honestly.  The White Paper exponentially increased the difficulty to European Jews of getting immigration papers, according to account after Holocaust survivor account, as well as work by esteemed Holocaust scholars such as David Wyman (Abandonment of the Jews). Besides refusing to consider a plan to save Europe's Jews, the British deployed 100,000 troops and a large armada in Palestine and the Mediterranean to capture Jews escaping from Europe and return them to that hell--policies the White Paper spelled out. Britain intended to limit Jewish immigration, and did so very effectively.   Once Britain opened Palestine Mandate and foreign office records, decades later, historians discovered that all correspondences concerning wartime immigration into Palestine, among other items, had mysteriously disappeared. In other words, Segev discounts the fact that British officials, obviously mortified post facto by their inhumane actions in 1939 and after, destroyed all especially damning evidence. Segev ignores the fact that the British in London and Palestine well understood the effects of their White Paper policy on European Jews. Segev's thesis does not square with the facts.   Segev also gives short shrift to the 7-nation Arab attack on Israel upon her 1948 founding, belying the Arab intention to destroy the Jewish state. Arab League Secretary General Azzam Pasha in 1948 promised "a war of extermination," "a momentous massacre" to be remembered "like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades"-and gruesome acts followed. Israel lost 6,373 persons in the war, more than twice Arab losses--and nearly 1% of her population. Of these Israeli casualties, 600 were noncombatants abused, mutilated beyond recognition and decapitated by Arab captors, who were assisted by British military aide and blockades that turned a blind eye to illegal Arab gun-running.   Segev doesn't concern himself with the violence that preceded the 1947-8 war, who started hostilities--or why. He doesn't ask who needed to mount defenses or state the casualties on both sides. These is nothing here concerning British participation on the Arab side. In 1947, Israel accepted partition of less than 20% of the land allotted by the League of Nations in 1922 as a National Home for the Jews, while the Arabs begrudged Israel even that.   Much as I love books, this is one that deserves to be heaved out with the bathwater.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 This is by far the worst book I've ever read. I still really can't tell if this is written for children or if the author is just pulling our legs.  We are beaten over the head with the obviouse constantly.  I won't "give  away" the ending but suffice it to say all the characters show up that  you would expect to be present in an apocalyptic tale.  The authors secret  is to take a cliche, magnify it 100 fold and then beat you over the head  with it. Still, I did finish the book because quite frankly I had to see  how bad it could get. I was not dissappointed. If you've never watched a  movie just because you couldn't believe it was so aweful then you may not  see the beauty in this book 
 Bordewich has written a book that may appear to go againt stereotypes of Native Americans but this is just a thin disguise for the real purpose of the book which is an all-out assault on indian rights. On just about every issue, Bordewich glorifies those Indian peoples who are willing to assimilate to mainstream American culture while portraying those who want to hold on to their own, unique cultures as "fundamentalists" who are hopeless in their devotion to romantic stereotypes. Accusing anyone who is not willing to go along with his obviously conservative political bias of being addicted to stereotypes is Bordewich's way to squash anyone with different political views. His political bias is so strong that in several occasions it affects the quality of his research since he tries at all costs to pigeonhole the facts to fit his thesis. Pretending to be an objective reporter out to debunk stereotypes makes this a very deceptive book. My advice is to stay away and read someone who is more honest about his/her agenda. 
    Susan Ward,coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on TV, gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from AOL Films.    Director Mary Lambert tries and fails to give us a Basic Instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures, it looks like Warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with.  As the lack of film sets show.   If you like Susan Ward, then give this a movie a try, if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future, DON"T FIND IT HERE 
 Come on.  This is a book by Jim Belushi.  Need I say more 
 I reviewed on-line information for 10 days before purchasing this unit. I was shopping for price and features. This unit had a great rating with its 130 watt motor, and the average retail was around $90. However, this unit was a huge disappointment. I only had the unit for two weeks, and during those two weeks I only used it 3 times. I sliced one 5-lb boneless, cooked ham. Then a few days later, I sliced up a 1-lb pepperoni stick. A few days later, I sliced another 5-lb boneless, cooked ham. The slicer worked fine, "like a dream," the first time I used it. It worked just "OK" the second time, but by the third time I used it, smoke was coming out of the motor, it was running at about 1/2 the normal speed, and it was making a lot of noise. There was no way to contact Rival by phone. The only contact option was email or snail mail. I emailed them but got no response after seven days, so I returned the unit. This unit just doesn't have the "right stuff." It could be the "made in china" sticker on the bottom. I found this unit (Rival 1050-C) at Walmart.com for $59 + 4 tax + 7 S&H. I guess you only get what you pay for! Next, I am going to give the Waring F800 Pro a try. It is made in Italy and comes with a 5 year warranty on the motor. It's available for 184.95 at A2Z.com 
 I borrowed Changing Minds from the library looking for a foray into the science of altering opinion. The book is mostly write ups that are not supported.As other reviews say 'where is the proof? 
 Don't waste your money on it like I did. The author just bores you with terminology and never gets to where you want to go.  AVOID.... YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! 
 Very light weight, shallow coverage of a complex and interesting (for architectural photographers) subject.  The lighting diagrams are useful but in general the book does not provide much information or insight into the practice.   This is a coffee table book, sort of.  If you are interested in this corner of the photography world, try to find a used copy of Norman McGrath's now out of print "Photographing Buildings Inside and Out".  Norman is one of the grand masters of the craft and his book is the real thing, chock full of information.   If you are just starting out, I recommend Eric Roth's new book "Interior Photography: Lighting and Other Professioinal Techniques with Style".  Eric is a very successful Boston based architect/interiors photographer who writes clearly and is right on the mark about the basics of the business and the craft.   
 I picked up this book based on the background of the author...afterall, he's built quite an empire at Kleiner-Perkins and obviously has experience and intelligence.  Let's chalk this one up to a fun write for him perhaps detailing something he'd like to do in real life but would be too embarrassed in the final analysis.  I didn't find the situations believable at all.  Here's a bunch of gold-diggers who could find themselves knee deep in cash and society by sticking to their plan...that is, romancing and seducing the rich guy.  But they change their minds at a moments notice and don't seem to think about the consequences before diving into kinky stuff or exposing their actual sexual tendancies.  Frankly, I would have expected more from a guy such as Perkins with help from Steele.. 
 Reasons why I do not like this potty:  1) The shield falls off with one touch, ussually into the potty! 2) The potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways. 3) It is cumbersome to empty the potty. 4) Once the shield is lost (since it impossible to keep attached) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess.  I highly recommend that Bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield 
 This book offers no real insight other then the standard thoughts like cyclists should do high repetitions with low weight so as not to build bulky muscles.  Other standard thoughts include varying your workout over time to constantly stress your muscles so they don't become too accustomed to one particular workout routine.  The author references his personal training program available via his website one too many times for my taste. When reading the book you get the feeling that the "cycling" aspect of the book seems more the result of a search and replace operation in a word processor versus a book really geared towards cyclists.    If you haven't spent much time in a gym lifting weights then this book might be more valuable then I found it.    
 Gina is just like the protesters--she just doesn't "get it!" The liberal way of doing ANYthing is throw more of our tax money at it! Whereas Africa's problems including poverty & AIDS will NEVER be solved UNTIL they get the birth rate down! As long as more babies are born than people dying, their population goes up--VERY bad. The only way to eliminate poverty is LESS children!! Send money for that but nothing else.  
 I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations 
 I love The Foundations who made a lot of great music in the sixties. Of course everyone has heard "Baby Now That I've Found You" and "Build Me Up Buttercup", but they had so many great songs. I had a ten inch compilation from the early'80's with about ten songs, all of which are on this disc. They would've fit in very well with a lot of the Motown groups, although they were a multi-racial English band. I mistakenly gave this recording one star when I intended five. 
 There is one thing that every cookbook author can learn from How To Cook Without A Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know By Heart, by Pam Anderson (not the big-breasted one), and that is the art of the highly marketable title.  For starters, this artful moniker really plays on the single gal's fears about never being able to put together nutritious, attractive, varied, affordable, and delicious meals for her future family every single night of the week. You want your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates when you send them off into the big bad world.  So the plus side of this book is the title. That's where it ends. The big idea here is to help the reader become a non-cookbook-consulting cook by: a) teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to variation, and b) suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking techniques. Sounds interesting so far, right?  Well, the problem is that almost all the recipes rely on "canned low-sodium chicken broth", which I think is a bit of a weird ingredient. It's even included in the salad dressings. Other big hitters include: heavy cream, butter, and sour cream. Do people really eat like this? Regularly?  Why not make the Easy Fruit Parfaits for a quick and sweet ending to your meal? Just take a tall glass, drop in a few spoonfuls of sour cream, then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar, and some berries. Repeat until the glass is filled.  Crikey. Sour cream, brown sugar, and berries?!? Wouldn't it be just as easy to put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of Greek honey? Am I totally off base thinking that this sounds much more appetizing? Or, if calories are no object anyway, why not pick up some Baskin Robbins' Rocky Road on the way home from work? That's easy AND it's worth the internal havoc it will cause.  Oh, and here's a sample mnemonic device that I can't not share, it's that good:  "Cook tender vegetables with garlic and oil, Then toss in some pasta that's fresh from the boil."  Pure genius, right? Right.   In a way, the author was right - I CAN cook all these things without a book. But why would I want to 
 I usually love her work, but this book never took off and the two main characters were highly annoying.  Just eh... 
 Being a huge fan of "Yoga for the Rest of Us," I was looking forward to getting the second DVD, but this second DVD largely left me cold.  The stretching exercises are not as effective, in my view, and do not appear to work the entire body but focus primarily on the legs and lower back and almost not at all on the neck, shoulders, and arms/wrists.  The standing poses are in some instances more challenging, but their explanation and demonstration were not as clear, practiced, or well-thought-out as in the first DVD - some of the students appeared to be doing the poses for the first time without a clear idea of what they were supposed to be doing, and in one instance a standing pose was performed while the camera zoomed in on one student's face (not the most helpful way to convey how to do the pose correctly, especially when the verbal explanation is unclear).  The relaxation portion, while good, was not as effective for me as in the first DVD.  It may be a matter of personal taste or a slightly different target audience for the second DVD versus the first, but I likely will not rely heavily on this DVD for yoga exercises and will return to the first one, which I believe is a much better production 
 I know that about the book and it was a big dissapoitment. The disscripion of the book does not even match the story. Where is Joanne banks,david blackwell, and jonathan jones? I mean I spent 2 hours looking for thier carritor and i could not find it. This makes me so glad i check out books from the library and don't buy them. Like what block? This is smoe bs.  Go to the library then you can save your money 
 The suggestions in his book are misleading.  Not for the motivated young people who want to make a difference in the world.  No one can argue with his conclusions about workaholics.  However, no one is going to achieve much success with a goal of living and raising a family on $6000 a year. I read his book in about 3 hours - really a waste of time as far as practical advice is concerned 
 True, I do have to read part 7 still, but part 5 & 6 were very poorly done in my opinion.  First of all, it's obvious that the reason for the failure in 5 and 6 is that the gunslingers have lost their edge.  They have become parodies of themselves.  In another review I saw the phrase, "overly mannered," which I feel hits home.  The redundant vernacular: palaver, deal in lead, come commala this, come commala that, come commala with a wiffle ball bat, so... King is fastidious with his overdone jargon that sounds sickenly hackneyed.  Since when did gunslingers become such wimps?  Since part 5 & 6.  That's when.  The repetitive symbolism gets overdone until anything having to do with a 19, dinn, or Ka, is just charred nuggets.  The symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times.  As another reader stated, I can't wait to finish the Tower Series, so I can feel some closure on a story that went sour.             
 We bought this book for our 3 year old who is fascinated with dinosaurs. I was pleased with the illustrations and the easy to follow layout, but when we got to the T-Rex, Xenotarsosaurus and the Yangchuanosaurus, the pictures became too graphic for my son. For example, the T-Rex is carrying what looks to be a severed limb from another animal in it's mouth. I realize that some dinosaurs are meat eaters, but I was hoping this book was a little less explicit. I think this book could be better for an older child 
 I like poetry, but I don't think it works well when writing a book on mathematical history. The point of this book seems to be the showcasing of the author's formidable command of language. OK - now that we know how great the author is in his use of language - what's left? There is some good information, but nothing so extraordinary that it merits the work you have to go through to glean it. SUMMARY: Long on beautiful language, short on information 
 This is a waste of two hours. Complete trash. Jennifer Jason Leigh is as ugly as a donkey's butt, and the only likable factor of this movie (Sam, the adorable little Golden Retriever puppy) is pushed out a window. I didn't really like it to begin with, but seeing the cute little thing cruelly killed by Psycho-Bitch made me turn it off. A waste of time and money. Get a movie that'll put you in a good mood, especially if you're a dog lover, like me 
 Sorry to say it, but this book is not very good at all.  There is no depth or scope to it, not getting inside the people.  The writing it tricky and flashy and does not balance out with the horrors these people perpetrated.  I do not believe this author got to know his subject matter very well, and has offered only a glib, clever style to cover up for his lack of understanding his subject.  I have read the book, MANSON, by John Gilmore, and find it to be the best one showing the Manson side of the story.  HELTER SKELETR shows it from the police side.  Either are better than this poorly done book 
 this book could have been so much more, I am sorry the leading lady was a bore and she fell in love with a jerk for no other reason than she couldn't read him.  the hooky pooky reading of the palms made the book to far fetched to every really get into and the plot was no plot at al 
 Normally, I am very open to listening to new music -especially scenster/indie-hop - and when, months ago now, I'd heard about the Bravery I was intrigued. I turned on the radio here in San Francisco to the best indie station on the planet and kept my ears open. I remember hearing a song and thinking, "wow, the Strokes' new song is amazingly good." Then, when the announcer stated that the song was in fact performed by The Bravery, I was horrified.   Simply stated: how are these guys NOT the Strokes? Sorry, but they sound exactly like them... but not as good. Lyrically, they are not as original and the lead singer does not have the same passion or enthusiasm in his voice as the lead singer for the Strokes.   However, lucky for the Bravery, people are actually buying that they are a unique and catchy band. What a joke 
 I find it much more difficult to navigate this book than, say, Moreland and Fleisher's book of Latin grammar. Furthermore, it's verbosity is frequently difficult to penetrate. The author seems to have an aversion to synthetic explanation, relying instead on an overabundance of examples that serve to clarify little of the readers confusion 
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 I thought this book had some really weird ideas that wouldn't work. Some of them might even damage stuff. I am sending this book back and asking my mom how to clean things, even though I am embarrased that I do not know already. This book is no substitute for real experience. 
 Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one. 
 Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences.  Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works.  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  I'm still looking. 
 this book doesn't start out well with the inner monologues of a 5 year old who sounds 30.  yet, because i liked brite's previous novel, lost souls, so well, i hung on and trudged through.  unlike the developed characters and plot in her first novel, drawing blood is a grave disappointment.  its mainly lots of sex scenes, domestic violence, and drugs.  there is no real story to draw the reader in.  its not a book i would reccomend to others.  with talent such as brite's, i was very disappointed to see her name on this one 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 The normal elements of an Anita Blake novel (supernatural detective work, exciting action, and Anita's strong will) are reduced and pushed aside in favor of gratuitous sex scenes.  There's nothing wrong with a little romance, especially if it advances the plot.  However, these repeditive scenes are about as romantic and subtle as a sledgehammer.  They don't contribute to the plot, but instead interrupt it.    The excuse is that Anita has been infected by the ardour, a supernatural hunger for sexual energy.  Supposedly she got it from Jean Claude, even though it was never mentioned in the previous nine books.  It's a very flimsy plot device.   More annoying is the change in Anita.  Always before, she fought stubbornly to maintain her morals against all influcences.  However, she makes no attempt to resist the ardour.    The book is so different in focus, flow, writing style, phrasing, and word choices that I suspect it was partially or entirely ghost written.    I greatly enjoyed all the Anita Blake novels prior to this one.  I recommend reading those.    I advise against reading this one 
 My main complaint is that it is another misguided attack on the concept of the "Nobel Savage".  While I understand it is fashionable to do so in hopes of appearing appropriately "skeptical" and "realistic", it is, in fact, neither;  and I suggest such claims are both naive and anthropocentric.  A "realistic" analysis has to begin with a very basic principle of biology:  "Every organism is optimally expressed within the original environment that shaped it".  If you want to get an idea of what is an "optimally expressed" giraffe, for example, you don't look at the animal within a zoo environment ---rather you analyze its behavior within the original "wild environment" of that animal (its Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness ---E.E.A.).    Now it is naive and anthropocentric to imagine that the human animal is somehow different from every other organism existing on the planet.  As such, to obtain the optimal expression of the human animal, we must follow the same procedure.  One cannot look to our expression within the modern "zoo" in which we have now "contained" ourselves.  Instead, one must look to the "human wild environment" to gain this deeper understanding.  The E.E.A. of the human animal is defined by the hunter-gatherer nomadic extended families of Paleolithic times.  Thus, based the above foundational biological principle, that particular human expression within the E.E.A. must reasonably be defined as the "optimal hunter-gatherer" ---which is a simple rephrasing of the more popular term, the "Nobel Savage".  Even outside this analysis, it is readily apparent that all of us, presently, are "wilted flowers" in comparison to human animals who optimally "blossomed" within the environment that spawned them.  These original humans experienced the best developmental trajectory imaginable.  Every child grew up within an environment keyed to satisfying the very hard-wired needs that that same environment originally designed.    Like any animal growing up in a zoo (well-designed or not) the experience of a child growing up in the modern "human zoo" simply can't compare to the secure base of a non-dysfunctional extended nomadic family that prides itself on ending a child's tears usually within a few seconds (see chapter 8, "The Natural Child", within THE PALEOLITHIC PRESCRIPTION by Melvin Konner, et.al.).  And Pinker would somehow ignore that such a relatively "ideal" childhood developmnetal environment just might have an especially positive effect on the adult humans thereby produced?  Again, such a view, I maintain, is representative of a naive faith in our current "normality".  My cynicism is, contrariwise, that the modern human is so far removed from what is the optimal human expression that it is now almost hopeless to somehow find our way back.  It's very much as would happen if all the wild tigers were killed and we had to derive what is the optimal expression of that animal, artificially, from a survey of various zoos.  Could we ever re-create the original tiger in all its splendor outside the wild?  And, in turn, can we ever re-create the original optimal human expression, in all its splendor, outside the wild environment of the original savage --- The Nobel Savage?

 I am using this book in a senior-level research methods course and my classmates and I are all very frustrated with it. It assumes you already know all of the methods, and even though I have a good statistics background, I am having difficulties. It is extremely time-consuming to work through, so expect to spend a very significant amount of time on each chapter.  I do not recommend this book for any individual with little or no statistics knowledge, and I caution those who do know statistics 
 I had just read A Year in the Merde and loved it. My husband and I go to France very year, love everything about it, especially the differences between the U.S. and France. So many of the customs are unexplainable to us, one being that whenever we go to anyplace in France, we expect it to be closed.  The hours the stores keep I cannot figure out, and the hours of the restaurants vary also. We see a sign that says(in French) open all the days, we go the next day and the place is FERME(closed). A Year in the Merde points out so many differences, I just laughed and laughed, as none are serious, just something you must deal with.   We were told that 60 Million Frenchmen was also a very funny book. It is not. Not one bit. Do not buy it if you are looking for something light. 
 I saw this film years ago on a crappy videotape, so before writing my review I decided to give the DVD a chance and you know what?  The picture quality on the DVD isn't much better (if any) than the videotape and the story still sucks.  Yea, Vanity gets naked but it's done in such an unsexy way that it's well unsexy.  She looked sexier with clothes on in THE LAST DRAGON.  The story if you can call it that is about Vanity pining for her ex-boyfriend, one night she falls asleep and has an 80-minute dream about them living on a tropical island together.  Soon she finds a freaky looking gorilla and starts a relationship with him.  The boyfriend is jealous and a war breaks out between the two, the gorilla and the man that is, with each kidnapping the girl away from the other and raping her. 
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 I saw the movie and thought the book must be even better...nope. It was like listening to a thirteen year old girl whine. It made me uncomfortable reading it she was trying so hard to be a good writer that I felt embarrassed for her. I stopped reading after chapter 1 and sold it to a book store for a dollar 
 following in the footsteps of oceans eleven, in one word... horrible.  the plot was really weak, and the ending was completly unexpected, in this case, that was not good.  there was nothing wrong with the actors, they were all good, it is just the plot was horrible. 
 If you're an aspiring screenwriter, it always helps to just watch one movie a whole bunch of times and make your own with some of your own twists to differentiate it and people won't call you a ripoff. That seems to be the in thing to do now since there have been so many remakes, or as they're called "re-imaginings" that you wonder what was the point in making it. Normally I would excuse such films but not in the case of the Black Christmas remake. Written and directed by Glen Morgan and produced by James Wong, it's hard to believe this film is brought to us by the guys who did some amazing episodes on the X-Files.  It's Christmas time and a sorority is celebrating the night before they all go off with their families. Around this time, a murderer named Billy Lenz escapes from prison and he's heading to the sorority. Stricken with a liver disease that gives him yellowish skin, he has a weird fixation for eyeballs and he has it in mind to ruin the girls' night.  Like a lot of recent horror films, there's a tendency to have the horror come through gore shots and if the phrase "weird fixation for eyeballs" doesn't give an idea for what you'll see then look elsewhere. Granted, there is a deleted scene included that's even more extreme yet at the same time, it's still quite gory and after awhile it wears thin. There's almost a sadistic quality in seeing girls not only suffocating through bags over their heads but to ALSO have one repeatedly stabbed is excessive and robs what's already a traumatic event. Another problem is giving the killer a backstory. Just like Leatherface, we can't just simply have characters face real evil and menace, it has to be people who have been screwed over by life and are lashing out. What was scary (when you didn't think about the cheesy stuff) was the fact people are being harassed by a kind of supernatural presence or evil personified and here it just makes everything seem ridiculous.  If you're a guy, one good thing about the film is the amount of ladies on hand. From Buffy's Michelle Trachtenberg to Lacey Chabert (Party of Five) to Mary Elizabeth Winstead (of Final Destination 3), it's hard to watch cute ladies getting diced. Of course it doesn't help they all tend to play the same type which is sarcastic, spoiled rich-chick. We get Andrea Martin as well from the original but still, it's disappointing that they don't do much before each girl is ceremoniously offed.  Is it worth a watch? Hard to say since only a rare few actually like it but it's hard to like something that's just so bad in the first place and convincing yourself there's some merit in here will take awhile 
 Don't waste time if you're looking for an excellent intro text for a business ethics course.  This text has the following virtues: -reasonable overview of normative ethical theory in chapter 2 -short, pithy case studies to motivate problems  The text has the following vices: - it totally ignores libertarianism in the discussion of normative ethics (a significant oversight since it dominates the Western approach to property, contracts and other business issues) -there is a biased inclusion of primary sources.  For example, you'll find an essay in favor of unions but none opposing.  There is an essay criticizing employment at will but none defending it.  There is a defense of prferential treatment in hiring (e.g. affirmative action) but none criticizing it.  There is a quasi-defense of manipulative advertising but none criticizing it. -some of the primary sources are simply poor choices for a business ethics text.  They are either poorly argued or merely tangential to the real issues.  For example, "Buddhist Economics" by Schumacher, "Homosexuality, Prejudice, and Discrimination" by Mohr, "The Place of Non-humans in Environmental Issues" by Singer, etc.  Instead, I recommend the Beauchamp and Bowie anthology 
 We selected this book for our discussion group this month.  And I started reading it several days ago.  The first half of the book went slowly; it was confusing and uninteresting.  The second half picked up with some tension and interest.  And the ending just triumphed with sadness and melancholy feelings.  I watched the Patriot/Broncos game while reading the story.  And the storyline followed the game 
 This book gives me an alien feeling, me being an American. One third of the examples are huge classical buildings which aren't really the simplest examples possible. The other 2/3 are these bizarre examples from the early 20th century, which are eye soars. Aalto Alvar, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, James Stirling, and Frank Lloyd Wright are shown 127 times. Hopefully there is a book that is more friendly to an American who likes traditional American styles 
 Lies, half truths, spin and glitz.  Of course there is some truth sprinkled in.  Self promoting TV stars are more interested in being self promoting TV stars than truth. Theres just not enough time for both. At best it's entertainment, at worst it misleads the children.  And finally they are all biblically illiterate.  So be careful...especially with TBN. 
 I got this swing And I will be talking it back. I put it on 5 and It will not move. I don't know what it would be like with the baby in it. I just tryed it.  
 This has been a very absorbing read, very detailed, chronologically ordered account of each sector of this war. Each battle is described right down to almost every single trench fight, while constantly invoking the strategic aim behind the battles.  However, at a soldier's level, this at best is an account of how the British saw the war. How the British felt about the war, and how the British saw other Allies and Enemies seeing the war. While there is enormous amount of coverage of British soldiers' record of letter-writing, diaries and poem-writing (there must be a hundred poems in the book - it seemed like every soldier was a poet at heart), there is not a single mention of any feelings of any other soldier who took part in the war. You want to know what the ordinary German soldier was thinking? Or even Britain's allied French, and American soldiers? You get an acount of what the British thought they were thinking. That's it! And its not for the lack of existence of any record. Its simply that the only research done was from British sources. The only account of any other country taking part in the war, has been of leaders, so you'll find some statements from the Kaiser of Germany, some generals in the French army, Adolf Hitler's letters to his landlord, etc, but no mention of any ordinary soldiers. It was refreshing to read at one point an account of a British soldier writing in his diary how a few German soldiers on the opposite side of the trenches at the frontline let it be known that they too were sick of the war. It finally gave a human face to the "German Soldier". It would have been great to know what a lot of these soldiers were actually writing in letters to their mothers, and what's recorded in the official German history of the war. But there's nothing there. Not for Germans, or the Austrians, or the Turks, and not even for the Allies.  And now for the truly disappointing part: Germans were "cruel" to use poisonous gases. British were forced to use the same gases, such had become the deterioration in mindset caused by the war. Turks and Austrians "butchered" the soldiers, while the naval blockade by British Navy of Germany causing over 80,000 civilians in Germany to die of starvation is mentioned as a matter of fact. Account of Turks handling the British POWs is deeply humanized from the prisoners' letters and poems, talking about the cruelty, but nothing is mentioned of any of the millions other prisoners that any other country possessed.  Churchill was as big a colonist as any other of his time. This is completely over-looked by the British historians, as if this wasn't really a bad thing. It flies in the face of what leaders on the opposite side were trying to do. So while the annexation of Belgium and Serbia and Poland are accounts mentioned in terms that a reader should find disturbing, British proposal of breaking up the Ottomon Empire, handing Syria, Palestine, Baghdad, Basra, Beirut etc to other countries as incentive to join the war should simply be read as military strategy.   If the wording had been the same for annexation of land and killing of people, this book could have been qualified as an impartial history of the First World War. 
 If claire of the moon, was not enough self absorbtion for you, the tale of a writer director...using actors like puppets for herself and killing their creativity, this book proves the author writes for herself...contrived...Paris?? Isn't this the director who had an affair with her lead, then lived with her and pretended to be living in Paris in her living room? sHe creates her world in writings and film without allowing others to be themselves as her characters are simply a reflection of herself or a fantas 
 If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series.  This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over.  I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was "That's it?!" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels 
 This guy's not real, though he may write well about a very serious topic...Hollywood believes him!  If you like fiction--read Tom Brown, Jr.  If you like the real deal, there are other sources, which are far superior, though not as well written 
 I agree fully with "A music fan" above ... this and David's self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work. I love most of Talking Heads music but don't rate Remain in Light highly like most fans do 
  Those of us who know and except the TRUTH about biblical gender roles need to speak us and let poeple know were we stand.As the prior reveiwer professes they are trying change the church.We need to stand up against this rebellion,because GOD IS ON OUR SIDE,and the bible stands behind us not them 
 Just as the previous review states: I bought this toy for my daughter, age 3.5. At that age, kids are supposed to LOVE paint or anything to do with it. Well, after trying for half an hour to make it work for her in the 90+ degree heat in Florida, she asked to go inside.(that should be your first clue)  It wasn't any fun at all, and here's why:  1) The paint is very thick. I thought it might just be from sitting inside in the cold air conditioning. But after being outside (in 90+ degree heat), the paint didn't thin out at all, and when we turned the machine on, hardly any paint came out. I was *expecting* a Spin Art for the sidewalk. We got some little paint splatters, but nothing like is shown on the commercials.  I called the Toys R Us I bought it from and they agreed to take it back: being used with a destroyed box.. 
 Well, first off, I'm not sure if it's the card, or the N1 router itself, but ever since I installed the new N1 serious wireless in my home, I have had nothing but problems and poor connectivity. They clam that the N1 has extended range, I went back to my Pre N wireless and got twice the range and way better reliebility then with the N1. The concept seems good and the descriptions are great, but i can't say I feel the product is what they say it is 
 I actually read this entire book just to see if/how Beatrice would get what was coming to her. Yes, the book is about incest. The ads and cover I've seen for this book state something like "Murder, Incest, Betrayal" or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest. The thing I didn't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex. Sex scene after sex scene. I frankly belive it's better to leave it to the imagination. We all know what happens when you have sex. But really it seemed more wrong that Beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love. It wasn't just the incest that was gross. Gregory's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times. After everything, I think what Beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts I've ever read. This book was at the most okay and I do not recommend it 
 This is the first time I have been truly disappointed in something I have gotten through Amazon, much smaller than it looks in picture, if it was five dollars it would be too much, too late now to do anything for Christmas,just not worth it at all............ 
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 I don't want to say that this is a boring Mafia book. But if you are looking for the action and drama in the "Godfather," then go read the "Godfather" or rent the movies. However, Gay Talese's reporting skills has never ceased to amaze me. "Honor Thy Father" is just another proof 
 Pros: Someone recommended this book to me, and when he did, I asked him why in the world would he think I'd be interested in a book written by a cop, specifically because I've never made it a secret that I do NOT trust police and I'm extremely burnt out on the Biggie/Tupac's death considering I wasn't a fan of either of them.  He told me that it talked about some interesting parts of hip hop crime and that there was only one chapter on Biggie and Tupac.  Indeed, he was right. This book delved into the Jam Master Jay killing, along with the criminal issues of Murder Inc., Young Jeezy, Jay-Z, Diddy, 50 Cent, J. Lo, Lil' Kim, Foxxy Brown, Suge Knight, Snoop, Game, Dr. Dre, etc., in addition to the murders of Freaky Tah, Tupac, Biggie, and more.  It was interesting to read about the details that I did not hear in these cases, such as cops handcuffing J. Lo to the top of the cage.  That's a prime example of why I feel the way I feel about cops. Was it really necessary to do that?  In that aspect, I can feel this book. There were many times when Parker complained about how the NYPD handled witnesses and innocent victims as though they were criminals, and he hit it right on the head by explaining that if the NYPD continues to be as domineering and violent as they have been to get people to talk, the streets and crime will continue to be on different playing fields with no intentions of a fair game.  Cons: 1) I'll admit that even as a professional copyeditor, I can look over errors. It's much safer to let at least two pairs of eyes read a manuscript than one. I'm hoping that's what happened with this book. No copyeditor will catch every single error, but about a quarter through this book, I was seeing so many errors to the point where I wondered was it copyedited at all?  Commas out of place, words in the wrong order, past tense with present tense, and other glaring errors that should've been caught by even the most casual reader.  2) I was so tired of this man patting himself on the back.  It was to the point where I thought he was molesting himself trying to talk about how great he was.  He kept italicizing "I" and "me" as if we didn't understand that he deserved credit for something. Then, he kept on bragging about how cops were coming to him for help because he knew about hip hop.  In mid-story, he'd start talking about how he knew something was wrong because he was so well-informed of the subject.  Okay, we get it.  If the man had just told the story and his actions, we could've come to the same conclusion without reading about you and your Hip-Hop Superman Cape.    3) Over and over again, he made idiotic statements that only cops can come to the conclusion of.  The word "accidentally" and "Amadou Diallo" should NEVER be used in the same sentence. That was flat-out intended murder; nothing accidental about it. Even though he kept saying that hip-hop was not the full reason for violence, he kept throwing out all these random examples about how they equate, without ever mentioning the fact that poverty can play a great big hand in that.  He uses examples like Kanye West to say that some rappers don't go down the same violent path, but what a drastic comparison.  Kanye West didn't live nearly the life that Snoop Doggy Dogg did and there's no way anybody is going to tell me that the neighborhood and economic gain does not play a hand in the attitudes that many "gangsters" and drug dealers have in how they view life.  This is not to say that it is right for them to be suicidal all the time, but I can't see how he couldn't understand that.  4) Throughout this whole book, he made it seem like he was one of the best cops and he seldomly talks about anything he does wrong. Even when he does, he blames it on his boss making him do it (ex. creating the hip-hop binder).  He claims he's not a drinker but consistently talks about how he doesn't remember certain places he was at because he was so drunk and having fun.  He talks about how other cops were scared but he was excited to be in drug-ridden, violent areas of Brooklyn.  That in itself concerns me.  To me, that's like saying that this cop viewed these areas like the board game Clue.  He may find it amusing that he caught the killer, but none of these killers, witnesses, and children in the area find their everyday life "fun."  It's very easy to criticize one's lifestyle when you don't have to live it on an everyday basis.  5) The man seems to have all of these answers about how the NYPD and LAPD should operate to be a more productive police force, but there was something he did in this book that only stamped the "Why I Hate Cops" attitude into just about everyone who mildly thought it before.  There's a huge no-snitch policy in poverty-stricken areas (and quite a few middle-income areas too, the more the police act a fool)!  Every single time he talked about issues within criminal cases, he gave out real names of witnesses, as well as ALL the information they gave. He talked about buying them food and how so many were cooperative in telling their stories.  But the information he gave may not have all been accessible to the public.  Some of the killers got off free, and I don't even understand why he put so much information about what the victims said in this book.  Does he think all criminals don't read?  All they need is ONE friend to say that their name was mentioned in the book, and there's a whole new set of problems for these witnesses.  Victims and witnesses risk their lives telling stories about what has happened around them, and a cop documenting all the details in the book does not make anybody feel safer to go running to the cops. If anything, it makes them more hesitant.  Just about every chapter, I was shaking my head and thinking "He can't help it. He's a cop.  He doesn't understand how goofy it is to document this type of information."  Even if it's someone who hasn't been in a situation where they have to be a witness, a cop repeatedly bothering you can work a person's nerves to the point where they don't want to help you simply because they don't like YOU.  I went to a high school a block away from a police station and was harrassed ALL the time for unexplainable reasons, even as a reasonably innocent teenage girl.  It's going to take more than the no-snitch rule to get people to help in these communities. Cops have to pretty much change their WHOLE attitude before a lot of these people will trust them.  6) He speculates on how hip-hop is becoming organized crime and how Jay-Z and 50 Cent have marketing deals. I don't even understand this comparison.  It's not like these were dudes fresh off the street who walked in rapping and got gymshoes.  They both had to fight their way to the top for these companies to even pay attention to them.  Yes, they were both drug dealers IN THE PAST. So what?  Is every marketing company supposed to look at their background, ignore the fact that they are legit now, and not do business with them? If that's the case, America wouldn't have survived this long. This country was created from thieves and slaveowners.  If Wall Street can get rich, so can hip-hop.  Parker talks about how most Fortune 500 companies wouldn't do business with people with this background.  I hate to break it to this dude, but if companies weren't going to get rich off of criminals, America wouldn't be one of the most powerful countries that it is now off of FREE labor and the attitude "well, it's all in the past now."    As I figured, I didn't like this book and it didn't improve my opinion on cops, but when he wasn't talking about how great he was, I did find out some missing information that the media has screwed up in their daily reports 
 I own over 100 Brazilian CDs and this is simply the worst of the lot.  I should have known when I saw Bebel Gilberto included.  This is simply a collection of Brazilian musicians who are ashamed to be Brazilian and have to incorporate this electronic garbage from North AMerica into their music.  If you are new to Brazilian music, don't even consider this CD.  Look for a collection of samba, axé, forró or something truly Brazilian 
 In my opinions...First of all -- this book is mostly about tornado chasers -- not hurricane chasers. You will be very dissapointed if you are seeking information about hurricane chasers. Secondly -- much of the information in this book (including correct information) is available on the Internet. On a professional level, it is very difficult for me to give this book any form of praise. In a wordy, carefully composed attack, the author makes several inaccurate and otherwise misleading statements about me and my background -- which has always been of the highest regard. For example, the author says I never worked as a technical consultant for the motion picture "Twister." Wrong! I was one of the initial consultants in 1994 after I received a call from Ian Bryce the producer of the film. I have a letter from Warner's posted on my web site. The other accusations are equally false and can easily be debunked.  Judging by my own case, readers and editors should question other elements in the book as well. It must be noted that he is not a storm chaser or a chasing or weather expert. In my opinion, he made the fatal literary mistake of making close friendships with only one side of the chasing world and his text was polluted and unbalanced. Ironically, of all the chasers mentioned in the book, I am the only individual mentioned in such a venomous and misleading manner. Furthermore, the author fails to mention any of the contributions my company and I have made to severe weather education and safety over the past 16 years. One could surmise why the author decided to attack me only -- we both have published storm chasing-themed books and will now compete for speaking engagements, press, etc. (My book is "Storm Chaser," a autobiography and picture book.) His agenda is clear. Other reviewers have added their own comments concerning the book including: "Inaccuracies and inadequate research." Even the author's trusted "chase guide" has personally written to me saying the book contains "many errors and mischaracterizations," and the "author was not honest with him." As for the rest of the book, in my opinion, it's not the classic or gripping type of literature that I enjoy. This is not an "Into Thin Air" level of literature -- not even close. He overlooked the true story of chasing. As an author myself, with over 18 years of chasing experience -- I submit that volumes of spellbinding anecdotes could be written about the truly negative, bizarre, hateful, sophomoric and dangerous antics of the "real" chasing world -- not this homogenized version a "poetry teacher" attempts -- guiding the reader to sleepy land. The most unfortunate aspect of this book is that most editorial reviewers and the public reviews I have read -- are not aware of the "real" world of storm chasing. Thus, the author had a carte blanche to write what he wanted without fear of scrutiny. Reader beware 
 Travolta was great in Saturday Night Fever, but this country version just didn't work.  Although he's a good actor, he just was wrongly cast in this film 
 The Light of Other Days, ostensibly co-authored by Arthur C. Clarke, is marketed as a philosophically intriguing tale of the transformation of Earth society in the not-so-distant-future, upon the advent of a remote viewing technology that removes all pretense of privacy from people's lives, and even allows observing events in the past. This is an enticing premise, but it's all downhill from page 1. In fact, the premise is all that's left after you discard the juvenile writing style, the paper-thin plot, the one-dimensional characters, and the Discover magazine-grade science.  I actually gave up on it halfway through, after enduring chapter after chapter of egregious exposition. Relentless, finger-wagging infodumps in dialogue and newscasts read like the following (paraphrased, but not the least bit exaggerated): "'As you know, David, the warning signs of global warming went unheeded way back in the early 2000s, and now there's a permanent El Niño.' 'Why yes, Kate, not only is England, which had to become the 52nd U.S. state after international trade collapsed, locked in ice, but more than 60% of the earth's land is no longer farmable.'" The most blatant morality plays in Star Trek aren't even this bad. These passages are also buffered by a superfluous sex scene that tries to appeal to women, but was clearly written by a man.  And then there's this gem of dialogue, at which point the book cannot be taken any less seriously: "It's like what happened to the copyright laws with the advent of the Internet. You remember that? ... No, you're too young. The Global Information Infrastructure--the thing that was supposed to replace the Berne copyright convention--collapsed back in the nought-noughts. Suddenly the Internet was awash with unedited garbage. Every damn publishing house was forced out of business, and all the authors went back to being computer programmers, all because suddenly somebody was giving away for free the stuff they used to sell to earn a crust."  Yeah, 2001 or Rendezvous With Rama this is not; it's nowhere near the quality of Clarke's own masterworks, or any others in the genre, for that matter. That said, though, had this been marketed as a teen/preteen volume, I think it would be tolerable. However, I expected far more sophistication from an adult work, especially one with Clarke's name on it. Save your cash and wait for the TV movie 
 Don't waste your time with this, folks. This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film "Graffiti Bridge."   But if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet-shooting, then go for it 
 How can Stephen Mitchell even think of such an abberation - editing Walt Whitman's greatest poem? Sure, there are several versions of the Song of Myself, but if you want to read Whitman, read the original. The first version is the most powerful, and Whitman toned it down over the years, turning it into "poetry" rather than his initial burst of enthusiasm. There are several editions of the poem that will let you get the true texts: for example, the Library of America's complete Whitman has both the first version of Leaves of Grass and the "deathbed" version, which Whitman revised shortly before his death. There are other versions throughout Whitman's career, as he added poems to the Leaves, and tinkered with existing poems. But this book is a sham. Avoid it 
 I bought this book to use in a class, but I only read four pages before giving up because it was just too much to read. Get a magnifying glass people. This book is written in fine print. You'd think they would publish it in a font that would comfortable to read. For that reason alone I returned it in favor of another 
 This is not a review of Ms. Yates's writing.  Instead, I am awarding the single star to the physical book perpetrated by the University of Chicago Press in 1991.  The good news is that this edition doesn't cost very much.  The bad news is that the 1991 edition is a bad reproduction of an earlier edition.  The ink bleeds all over some of the pages.  There are diagonal streaks on many pages.  Sometimes the ink is light grey on one side of a diagonal streak, while it is dark and smudged on the other side.  Parts of letters that landed in the streak are missing.  A note on the back of the title page claims only that "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the ... Standard ... for Library Materials."  Does this less than ringing endorsement mean that the paper is acidic and will soon deteriorate?  If so, it won't be much of a loss 
 Jim Hightower needs to quit stabbing people in the back. That is not how you solve America's problems. Another piece of pure fiction from a Michael Moore wannabee.  
 What was Bobby Hicks thinking about when he recorded Fiddle Patch? He has ruined some good fiddling by including three vocals which would make any country music lover cringe - they are straight out of the Top Forty charts. As examples of soppy, stupid, schmaltz they excel and should never have included in an album of traditional fiddle. You have ruined this CD for us Bobby please do not do it again 
 There are some tidbits of info in this book that are educational, but it in no way focuses on S-corps (the subtitle is deceptive). It is more an incomplete overview with some brief stops to go in depth on select topics, with examples and discussion biased mostly towards C-corps. I was surprised that the chapter on which state to incorporate in only discussed Delware (and not even well). There should definitely be a discussion on Nevada as it has become a highly considerable candidate for the honor. As I completed the book it became apparent to me that this was largely written pre-2001 (this is an opinion), although it is copyright 2003. The author's preable in which it is introduced that the tax rates have changed, but that the reader should just keep that in mind instead of the author going back and revising the numbers, is emblematic of the off-the-cuff manner in which this book was written and proofed. 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 This calendar doesn't have enough knitting patterns. There's way too much 'filler'--the quotes are particularly useless. I'm also not interested in knitbit trivia about knitting (In what universe does anyone care about the year in which the first purl stitch was done?). The Monday 'fave fiber' pages are product placement advertising. The calendar does include a few interesting websites and a few helpful knitting tips. But overall, they've wasted much of the 365 days with filler (ridiculously obvious June 26th tip: photograph your knitted projects when finished.)  If they replaced the quotes, knitbits and fave fiber pages with actual patterns, then I would buy this calendar again. As is, I would say go for the Pattern-a-Day calendar instead 
 I used this book as a text for a very large (~150 students) first-semester course in biostatistics for public health grad students.  It is lavishly illustrated and has huge problem sets at the end of each chapter.  It uses lots of examples.  I did not think it did a good job of either conveying either intution or theory.  Many definitions are far short of rigorous, and students seemed dissatisfied with the resulting uncertainty.  The problems are far too repititive.  I would prefer a more terse book which provides definitions and theorems that actually can be used 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 I expected more from this when I rented it, but overall it wasn't too bad either.  The name of the movie gives you most of the storyline: A rough night in Jerico.  Too bad though, this movie had potentia 
 I liked the Baby Whisperer book, even though I did not agree with her on everything.  This book seemed like a book put out in a hurry without the detailed know how of her first book.    I am certain her techniques work well with passive toddlers.  If you have a demanding toddler and juggling a demanding life, you will likely find this book frustrating.  Much of her advice when tried on a demanding child will get you no where.  She does have some good tips, but overall I did not get as much substance as I did fromt he first book 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 I might as well re-draft this review as only 0 of 2 people enjoyed the first draft.  That's wouldn't normally phase me, but I can do better for you in this case.    I first saw a segment of ST-2 on cable and mistook it for an anemically budgeted direct-to-DVD release.  This ticked me off a bit because I'm a fan of Phil Tippett, who got his major feature film directorial shot on this movie.    Having now got the DVD, I have unreeled it from the beginning and I find it loads more ambitious, intelligent and well rendered by director Tippett than I had given the producers credit for permitting.  Tippett has been an innovator in the CGI field -- stop-motion, go-motion, and transitional model-to-CGI models manipulated so as to provide dynamic effects for an impressive array of digital creatures. Among those milestones are the perfectly convincing insect creatures in the first STARSHIP TROOPERS movie. The multitudes of individually rendered creatures in STARSHIP TROOPERS are spotlessly realistic.    As a general rule, if a studio greenlights a movie sequel as a direct-to-DVD release, they intend to suffocate the production -- whether the franchise has been good, bad or mediocre in the market -- by simply failing to provide a generous -- or even a minimal budget -- to sustain life support in any recognizable way.  Trust me -- starve any sequel of support and money and you become a key factor in ruining even the best of franchises.    STARSHIP TROOPERS (the first) was not a runaway commercial hit on first run, apparently, when compared to its $100 million cost.  But sci-fi buffs are a loyal film audience with eternal memories, and it is certain that this ambitious sci-fi production will continue to attract countless repeated viewings -- and income -- for the rest of the studios' and the filmmakers' natural lives.  Nobody loses on this one.  A sequel is hardly a big gamble if one invests long-term.    Regardless of that, director Phil Tippett has not only done an impressive job of directing his first major film, he has also done a very smart job of producing a generous portion of images large in scope and convincing in power within his spare budget.    Looking at the bug war scenes in the first act, you might easily not suspect there were any production restrictions at all.  Credit Mr. Tippett for that achievement.  In fact, there are moments that benefit from lessons learned in the first movie, which have added impact as a result.    Now for a few notes:  I would have liked to see the bug culture and biology expanded in new, logical ways.  I would like to have seen bug life-cycle mechanics which did not rehash ground covered by other unrelated movies -- what has been done and re-done in sci-fi productions as far back as ALIEN.    The creative possibilities for an intelligent multiped, exoskeleton, hive-bred civilization are unlimited.  There is no need at all for the writers or FX techs to resort to the over-used and tired gimmick of an alien climbing from one human's mouth to another human mouth, for example.    Nor do we need yet another script in which we revisit the old familiar premise of films from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS to THE HIDDEN to THE THING that anyone can be inhabited by an alien and still appear normal.  It has been done to death.  Let's move on and discard that whole much copied process.    I could tell you things about the way a crawdad captures and eats a minnow from the tail forward that would make your hair stand on end. There is plenty of fresh, untapped bug behavior to mine, and there is far too much writing talent involved with the STARSHIP TROOPERS series to need to use anything rehashed from any previous motion picture.   Still in all, Phil Tippett's feature debut as director is more than competent and particularly surprising for his facility with the actors.  I look forward to his future development as a director.    
 I purchased this book to give as a gift to my nephew.  When it arrived, I opened the book to the middle and I could not believe what I was looking at.  One of the art scenes is of a battle where a man charging on a horse has been decapitated.  Blood is spewing from the headless neck, his necklace is falling in one direction, and his separated head (with a horror/surprise look on his face) is falling to the ground behind the horse.  This is very gruesome, and there is no way I could give this as a gift a child of any age.  Wondering what could be worse, I turned the page to find another battle scene.  One man is being struck to the back of the head with a club/mace and his head is caved by the blow.  I am not making this up, the head is split open and details are painted.  Many others in this same art work lie dead and dieing with arrows in their heads and torsos.  I look at the next artwork, and a man is pinning another to the ground while he slices his throat with a knife.  Why would someone pick these art works?  Why would the editors allow them?  I'm still stunned that this would make it print. 
 I saw Kottke and Gordon play at the ACL Festival last year, and really liked what I heard. While I fully support artists getting paid for their craft, I will not support Sony in their misguided attempt to control their customers 
 I usually would briefly summarize the plot in my reviews, but there really isn't one to write about.  It feels like a "days of our lives" soap opera of Betsy's life...she and eric are in love, she and eric have a fight, then she and eric make up, re-wash and rinse.  I wouldn't mind this as much except Betsy is getting more annoying with each book.  I keep waiting for her to grow up and be more queenly.  Her though process is like a 13 year old, and I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up.  I feel like the author is making Betsy more immature so that she can put Betsy in sillier situations (that anyone with a brain can figure out in 2 minutes) to get a cheap laugh from the readers.  This is one book in the series that you can skip without loosing anything.  To be honest, I truly think Betsy's demon sister is a better character to read about.  Maybe the author could do that after Betsy's story fizzles out...like the next book.      
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 Actually, I listened to an unabridged audio book, and I thought it was the most painfully slow book I have ever read in my life. It was fairly well-written, but I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. Finally, it did, and the book was still crawling along. I really wasted my money on this one, and the only reason it got two stars rather than one is that it was well-written - but it surely could have used some pacing and plot 
 It's hard to know where to begin when talking about this sensationalistic tabloid-like book.  On the one hand, not everything is a lie, exaggeration, urban legend, or told in a gleefully sensationalistic manner, and there are good pictures, but those aspects are really overwhelmed by how much of the book just isn't true.  It's uncertain just what propelled Kenneth Anger (who has a very fitting surname) to write this book; was it the fact he was bitter that his own Hollywood career never came to anything much, a general dislike of most of the stars from Hollywood's Golden Age, a love of sensational gossip in general, or something else?  He's a writer of the same caliber as an Albert Goldman or Geoffrey Giuliano and their own celebrity biographies--it's been shown that most of what they've written just isn't true and has no basis in factual evidence and has never been proven, so you have to doubt everything they write, even if some passages are true or written in a respectful manner.  He's like the boy who cried wolf.  Although amazingly quite a few people believe all of the stories in this book and they're now regularly discussed like they actually happened and are absolute fact, even though they're the results of speculation, urban legends that have been disproven yet just won't go away because of books like this, and are outright lies and character assassinations.  Just because I'm a fan of many of the celebrities from Old Hollywood doesn't mean I'm incapable of accepting that some of them did have less than perfect lives, personal scandals, and were the complete opposite of their screen personalities.  But by and large, with certain exceptions, the stars of that era were classy, keeping their personal and private lives separate.  Even if they did have, say, problems with alcohol, sleeping around, or drug abuse, they still presented positive public images and role models of class, grace, and style.  It wasn't like today, when people seem to know just about every detail of a celebrity's private life.  Does Anger somehow feel that celebrities of yore were more prone to scandal and devastating problems?  And why does anyone want to know some of these sleazy details, like about someone dying on the toilet?  Are we supposed to suddenly no longer like this person's body of work?  Even some celebrity biographies that do report events of this nature at least balance it out with just as much positive information and a respectful tone, instead of taking delight in tearing down reputations.  It would seem baffling as to why people now take some of these stories as accepted facts, no matter how many times they've been disproven, but again, it seems to be human nature to believe the bad and not the good.

 This movie is silly at best, racist at worse. I can't believe Ice Cube actually wrote the script for this mess. My opinion of Ice Cube has been drastically lowered. It's the old black jiving and shucking all over again. This movie has all the classic black stereotypes. It even has a scene where Smokey gets so high that he ends up in the chicken coop thinking he's a chicken. Remember the old minstrel shows?: "nobody in here but us chickens." There's no  plot to speak of, just a bunch of insults, getting high, stealing money, potty jokes, black people knocking each other upside the head. Some character get punched out, and Smokey (Chris Tucker) goes over and yells in his face, "Dude, you been knocked out!" That's a typical "joke" from this movie. How about a dogcatcher getting bit on his behind by a dog? Hilarious---Not. After watching this dvd with my family, we tried to think of one funny or worthwhile scene, and we couldn't think of a single one. 
  In the post 9/11 world in which this book, subtitled "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East" was published, it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day. This, however, is not to be found in What Went Wrong?  Instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae. We learn, for instance, that, "A distinguishing characteristic of Western music is polyphony, by harmony or counterpoint. This begins in its simplest form with the choir, in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect; then comes the keyboard instrument, matching the ten fingers of the two hands, following different routes in a common purpose; and finally, the musical ensemble, from duets and trios to the full orchestra". While this is all well and good, and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level, it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity..." that has led to the precarious times in which we live.  Or, on another note (harmony? counterpoint?) we learn that Robinson Crusoe was translated into Arabic by Butrus al-Bustani and published in the late 1850's. Big deal!  What we don't learn anything about is the rise of militant Islamism. There is no mention of Wahhabism or how this fundamentalist Islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity. The Muslim Brotherhood also is not to be found in the index, nor is there a mention of Sayyid Qutb, or his writing of the incendiary manifesto, Milestones. Furthermore, there is not a single reference to al-Qaeda, though Usama bin Laden does appear, albeit seemingly as an afterthought, in what appears to be a hastily added Afterword.  So what went wrong?  Beats me.. 
 I have no idea why I saw this movie in the first place, perhaps it was because The Jungle Book is a fascinating story. However I was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly   (in a stupid way).The action scenes were terrible. I recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies. 
 Usually, when I purchase music, I'll tape off my favorite 4 or 5 cuts and forget about the rest of the songs. Not so on this album...there's not a cull in the bunch. The musicians in this band are such that even if you don't like bluegrass, after listening to these boys pick, you will at the very least have to admire their musicianship. I happen to play myself, and I'm pretty much a traditionalist, but there's enough of hard-drivin', down-home 'grass on this one to please anyone. If you're thinking of buying this one, in my opinion, you can't go wrong. Try it...you'll like it 
 Book Review The Slaves Shall Serve - Meditations on Liberty James Wasserman (2004)  When I bought this book, I had hopes that I had come to the end of a long search for a book that combined a genuine understanding of both politics and the occult.  That sense of hope mainly hinged on the fact that Wasserman is a Thelemite, one of the few modern esoteric traditions which I consider not fluffy.  Unfortunately, what I found was yet another magician who seems to have spent so long on the astral plane that he has been able to develop only the most superficial understanding of the social-political realm.  Wasserman has seen the smokescreen of liberal ideology for what it is... only to trade it for the most common and silly ideas put out by conservatives.  For example, while condemning the "liberal" notion of gun control, he states that he thinks Senator McCarthy was right, and believes than an invasion of blue-helmeted U.N. troopers is imminent.  One of the most amusing claims he makes is one parroted by right-wing talk-show host almost daily: that there is a leftist bias in mainstream media.  As evidence, he points out a Media Research Center report that found a 10-to-1 ration of "anti-gun" to "pro-gun" stories on major news channels between 7/1/97 and 6/30/99.  Well and good, but if the media is really so left-biased, then why did the same research organization find a *100-to-1* ratio of pro-war to anti-war stories in the months leading up to Gulf War II, at a time when the most conservative polls showed over half of all Americans opposing the war?  And if the media is so leftist, why do right-wing pundits like Newt Gingrinch and Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson all have their own talk shows while leading Left intellectuals like anarchist Noam Chomsky and socialist Howard Zinn find themselves confined to poorly-compensated tours between universities?   The gun-control essay is, in fact, the best-written and best-researched essay in the entire book.  There is another decent essay about Waco, but the documentary Waco: The Rules of Engagement, which Wasserman references, does a better job of laying out the horrors that the U.S. government carried out there.  The others I find to be rather groundless opinion papers with few convincing arguments to back them up.  The book is further weakened by the fact that these essays comprise a little under half of the book - the second half is a reprinting of the U.S. and U.N. Constitutions with some minor notes and observations tacked on.  The book sells for $20, a rather steep price for about 100 pages of original writing, especially for such superficial analysis.  I'm sure Mr. Wasserman really does cherish the idea of freedom, but I'm not sure he entirely understands it.  He condemns both collectivism and democracy!  "Would you really want the post office to run the world?" he asks, to which the True Libertarian (i.e. Anarchist, from whom the so-called libertarian party mis-appropriated the term) responds with a resounding Yes!  The post office is a perfect example of how a non-centralized federation of autonomous communities could function.  There is no central high command for the post office, but if you put a letter to Prague in a mailbox in San Francisco, it will get there.  Wasserman also defends the idea of a republic, saying that true democracy is like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.  Well, that goes to show that you can prove anything by allegory.  If we inject a little realism into this allegory, we can see how quickly it disintigrates though.  First of all, nowhere in nature will you find two wolves for every sheep.  Common sense tells you that this is impossible.  And even if wolves did outnumber sheep, it has been shown that even these fierce predators practice- not survival of the fittest!- but mutual aid, that other important anarchist principle.  If a member of the pack is sick or injured, the pack doesn't abandon it, but shares food to try and keep it alive.  The individualism which Wasserman so often invokes sounds to me more like egoism, which, unless I am mistaken, is the enemy in Thelema.  Perhaps that is why he feels the need to justify his worldview with a divine power as the basis for morality.  His position just doesn't hold up on its own.  The fact is, the whole liberal/conservative split is itself just a smokescreen put up to hide the true agenda of those in power, the heads of the multinational corporations whose GDPs are larger than those of almost every country in the world, and whose transactions in fact make up a large percentage of the GDP of the world's superpowers.  Both "liberal" and "conservative" presidents have obediently carried out the secretive and undemocratic World Trade Organization's program of "neoliberal" economic reforms.  NAFTA, for example, was dreamed up by Reaganites, refined under Bush Sr., put into action by Clinton, and then further expanded under Bush Jr.  More than the U.N. coming to take away your guns, Mr. Wasserman, you should be concerned about the WTO coming to take away your food, your water, and your livelihood through programs which no bullet can damage 
 Unless you are already an expert at security and are looking for a strictly abstract approach, save your money!! Ramachandran's ramblings go on forever, with little imparted to the reader. The best comparison I can come up with for the experience of reading this book is that it's the same as trying to learn a foreign language from a mime. If Ramachandran spent less time trying to impress us with a bibliography that goes on for pages [I don't really CARE if he has read every security book in the world, if he can't distill this information down and pass it on the text is worthless] and more time on organizing his book [for heaven's sake, is a decent index at the back too much to ask?] then it may be usable, as it is, the only thing to do with it is level a table 
 I used this book for a research project on ID that I was writing for a class. As a Christian, I find much of the book to be somewhat offensive. The story of "Dave and Katy's Metaphysical Adventure" is cheap emotional manipulation in the form of a sermon. The message is clear - the reason your teenager is "turning away from God" isn't because teenagers are at an age where they are questioning the beliefs of their parents and trying to figure out what they believe themselves, it is because he is learning evolution in school. As page 100 says, "Creation is the first element of the Christian Worldview, the foundation on which everything is built". This means Young Earth Creationism, the literal reading of Genesis. In this book, and the popular accompanying study guide, which is widely used by churches, this literalist interpretation is being taught as a statement of faith, i.e. "if you don't believe the literal reading of Creation, then you don't believe". Old Earth Creationists need not apply. Ironically, this also casts doubt on many of the Intelligent Design advocates who lean toward Old Earth Creationism, such as Phillip Johnson, and about half of the pro-ID scientists who testified in the Kansas Science Standards hearings in May 2005. This also is ironic since Colson writes the forward for Dembski's book "The Design Revolution", where it is stated that the identity of the Creator doesn't matter. 
 With a childhood obesity epidemic in the United States, the last thing we need is a book that teaches kids to clean up their plates.  Though this series of books is generally fantastic, I am terribly disappointed with the eating habits this particular book seeks to instill.  Many prominent table problems among toddlers and young children are ignored.  Healthy eating and eating until one is full should also be covered, but the author is completely oblivious to modern medical opinions on nutrition and diet.  I am dumping this book ASAP.  If you are desperate to teach healthy eating habits, trying new foods, and nutrition choices to your young child, I suggest Eat Healthy, Feel Great by William Sears.  As far as table manners go and behavior management go, I am still looking for that book.  Please don't espouse outdated attitudes about eating to one more child 
 I never received the book. Got in touch with the senders. they supposedly sent me another copy, but that too was never receive 
 This is definitley Deborah Harrys worst solo album. It is overproduced, too slick and has no soul. Jocelyn Brown's backing vocals are also extremely out of place. The only decent track is the classic "French Kissin' In The USA", whilst the album version of "In Love With Love" is truly embarassing (the SAW version was by far superior!). I think Deborah has hit a bum note here. For a real masterpiece, buy her debut album "Koo Koo". Each track is a perfect gem 
 For twenty years or longer, Martha Grimes has been one of my favorite mystery writers.  Furthermore, in recent years, particularly in her Emma Graham series, she has emerged as an eloquent and graceful wordsmith.  Her ability to create a mood, from sleepy and laid-back to threatening to comical, with a few well-placed impressionistic brush strokes sets her apart from other writers of the genre.  Unfortunately, her emergence as a word stylist has been more than offset by her decline as a constructor of plots.  There is almost enough of a story line here for an economical, 200-page novel.  Almost.  Unfortunately, what we get is nearly 400 pages with no plot resolution; the story merely proceeds to a point and stops.  I assume that Part 2 will be forthcoming -- for another 20 bucks, of course.  Instead of a completed narrative, we're treated to half a story and a whole boatload of filler.  She gives us one too many performances of "Medea: The Musical." It only works once per book, Ms. Grimes!  Ditto the upstairs visits to alcoholic Aunt Aurora; the cab rides with the moronic Delbert; the trips to the diner in Cold Flat Junction, the musings on what lies beyond the line of trees at the horizon; the put-downs of Ree-Jane; the sabotaging of Miss Bertha's meals; and on and on and on. I often found myself thinking, "Not another one!"  Since Ms. Grimes' latest Richard Jury novel, The Old Wine Shades, suffers from the same defects as Belle Ruin -- no plot resolution and reams of marginally relevant filler -- I conclude that she has made some sort of deal with the devil to serialize her novels.  Furthermore, the multiple editing errors that other reviewers have noted indicate the same thing - that Ms. Grimes is now cranking out her books assembly-line style, a la Tom Clancy.  What a shame.  What a loss 
 Get together with some friends and as many bottles of wine.  That way you can possibly have some enjoyment with this inexplicable and boring movie. *special award* for expressionless characters.  *special award* for interminable shots 
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters (lefties) have deleted this review Twice.  Robert Reich, was Bill Clintons scariest appointment. His ideology, ergo his politics has been the of the most extreme left of any Bill Clinton's appointments. And some may argue that he some of the most extreme viewpoints of ANY high level appointment.   Robert Reich and his ilk were very happy when from the 1940's - 1980, radical lefties was setting the public agenda. All items were in play, courts were stacked and extremist's legislatures abdicated their law making ability to the courts. The executive branch simply turned a blind eye when radical lefties created a false impression that they were supporting the constitution when in fact they were and still are systematically undermining it. Left-Wing views that were on the fringe of the Democratic Party in the Sixties and Seventies are now center stage. These views, being forwarded by people like Reich, Dean, Kerry and Feingold, seem accepted as normal.   Left Wingers - control the media, academia, the sciences, think-tanks, and for most of the last century the executive, judicial and legislative branch. Republicans were demoralized, but the pendulum has finally begun to swing the other way. People are finally getting fed up with the extremist left who is arrogantly opposed to honest intellectual debate for they are fervently certain that they are correct in all matters. Their disdain for discourse and for anybody who challenges them is extant.  But the worst part is that radical lefties are uncivil to the extreme. They fill the public airwaves and bookstores with nastiness. Listen to Air America or watch a Michael Moore DVD. Read their editorials and you will find vicious vituperative attacks. Open a leftist political best-seller and you find more mean spirited screeds. Extremist lefties, RAD-COMS (Radical Communists) typically reduce political debate to nonsensical statements that seem to be making point but are nothing but vague and angry assertions, unsupported by facts.  But what we're now witnessing is something far more corrosive of civic life than normal political vitriol: It's viciousness directed toward anyone holding a view other than the prevailing elitist left-wing propaganda. Insults also calculated to belittle and ridicule entire groups or judged to be different are part of the divisive wedge that lefties like to play in hurting the cohesiveness of the nation.  The Conservative tradition values free speech and debate. No one should be deterred from speaking his or her mind for fear of offending some group. Lefties are opposed to this idea, the shouting down of Ann Coulter the attacks on Christians, etc, etc. Are all handiworks of the left. It is their mean-spirited trash talk that fills their protge's with this HATE and ANGER of anybody not like them.  I'm sorry Mr. Reich, I used to be one of these lefties, and I know the condescension with which I was taught to look at people on the right. The attacking of American Citizens rather than ideas, the smearing of whole segments of society for some perceived ills against our ideology. This is leftism at its base. Fear and Hate driven. No. Mr. Reich it will be a sad day when you and your type WIN America. People are waking up, they are realizing that the great Democratic Party of yesteryear has been hijacked by Radicals.   Your book speaks about morals but you never discuss where the morals come from. Conservative position comes from a bedrock of factual and historical facts. They are a clear-eyed view of where America is and where we need to go. Your left wing morals come from a modernist philosophy, blown by the wind and proven to be a disaster. You biggest moral imperative is to BLAME others but that is what happens when you are ideologically based rather than historically and fact based.  I could go on and on, but MR. Reich, I used to be on the left. But the divisiveness, hate, anger, name-calling, utter compliance with leadership, no dissention, no debate, and supreme arrogance drove me away. Once one is away and in the middle you look at the two competing political thoughts and it is scary, very scary to see what you once were.   Mr. Reich, I am not an automaton, and that is what you need to usher in your America. What the conservatives need, is open honest debate, free speech, and equal time. You have a fight on your hands, one that I am hoping for my children's sake that you lose. 
 This novel was a big disappointment to me.  It began with great promise but then fell apart at its midpoint.  I can only conclude that Ms. Aikens was writing under a deadline because the resolution of the various plot lines in the novel's concluding scene is ludicrous and unsatisfactory.  So save your money for another book 
 Just what we need, more people beside Gee Michael Blakey who love the CIA and are writing books on the JFK assassination.  I have NEVER written a revue before, but while browsing through the JFK material for a Christmas present for someone, I kept running into somone named Vince "P" (full last name withheld), and his rave revues for this book.    I don't know this man, but instead of simply using his name, he apparently felt compelled to follow it with some pedigree such as: "Vince P.: Cheerleader, FBI."  Who cares?  Why does he feel he needs to give us his bona fides?  If his opinion is valid, it's valid, whether he worked for the FBI or the Rockettes.  Of course, in Hoover's FBI, both would have been a possibility.  Please, no offense, sir...just joking.   Mr. P is probably a very decent individual, but I was left with the feeling that, without the tag after his name, he felt no one would take him seriously.  But I digress.  The book's premise is just plain silly.  So the story goes, the CIA has helped hide information on the assassination because it (CIA) liked the Kennedys so much that, it didn't want the world to know that both Kennedys had fostered a plan for a coup in Cuba, because it would show the brothers in a bad light.  Good ol' CIA.  Does anybody believe this?  Does anybody believe that, if something could show the Kennedys in a bad light, the CIA would have covered it up for forty years?  Does the "G" in Michael Blakey's name stand for "Gopher" for the CIA?  I mean, it's not like the CIA hated JFK because he was going to break them into a million pieces or anything...right?  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.  I really had high hopes for it, but both authors went to slavish lengths at every turn, to put the government-especially the CIA and FBI-in a glowing light.  I got the feeling that at any moment they were going to show a doctored photo of J. Edgar Hoover in full football gear, takling a young Crazy Legs Hersh with the caption, "Pug Hoover...the league's best two-way player, leads Saint Mary's U to another victory."    A sickening, fawning valentine to the government.  Spend your money on Dick Russell's, "The man who knew too much," instead.     
 The heroine Giana is an idiot who willfully falls in love with a fortune hunter.  By the end of the book she has been enlightened by a tacky summer trip to Italy with her Uncle Daniele to tour brothels, etc.  In one instance in particular, her uncle makes Giana strip in front of himself and another whore.  Giana gets home and immediately dumps fortune hunter boy because she all of a sudden recognizes his faults.  Her mother technically okays the trip.  It is hard to believe; however, that the whole fiasco could ever have happened because, regardless of her mother's business practices, a typically well bred english woman would never do this to her daughter.  The story jumps around too much.  The hero Alex practically rapes the heroine both the first time they meet (without success) and the second (with success and even though she is sick with the flu).  He then forces her to marry him after she makes it clear to us and to him that she doesn't like him.  He treats her badly and she still falls in love with him despite all she learned about him during her Italy trip.  The only  story in this book worth reading is the one about Giana's mother, Aurora.  The author should have written this as her story from the beginning instead of wasting time on the other two sorry main characters.  Giana's character really seems like two different people.  Spoiled little idiot rich girls don't change that much or that quickly.  This is a silly book.  This author does not write books that I consider be good and this one is no exception.  I won't be reading any more of her books 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 I struggle with this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, so part of me really likes this movie. But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks. If this appeals to you, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't like "Desert Heat." If even one of this doesn't sound good, stay far away 
 this book was not very helpful in preparing for the exam. the practice tests and timeline in the back of the book were extremely helpful, but the essays were terrible! any student should know that an essay should be way more organized than those in the book! their tips were not helpful at all. my friends had a book that had something like 10 tests in it - this was a good study tool. you can also find practice tests all over the internet. find something that will tell you the basics about the test, and maybe a timeline, but most u.s. history courses should cover enough that this book won't be helpful. i feel confident that i got at least a 4 on the test, but only because i studied with kids who had books besides this 
 Bruce Bawer, Daniel Pipes, Ibn Warraq, and others, have covered the important points with much greater skill and clarity.  And yes, there are important points: the threat of Islamist imperialism is real; the traditional Left's failure to grasp this has had catastrophic results; Eurotrash anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments are irrational and hypocritical; etc.  Beyond this, Berlinski is so pickled in Republican broth that she cannot stop undermining her own positions.  1. She complains of the urban sprawl and degraded environment of Europe, but wishes Europeans would breed faster. 2. She enjoys the freedom that European secularism gives her (as a secularist of Jewish parentage) but whines that more 'old tyme religion' is needed to counter Islamism. 3. She attributes Marseilles' (relative) freedom from Muslim mob violence to the inclusion of religious councils in city government. But must report the selection of a archetypal fundamentalist imam by the Marseille ummah.  The book appears to have been padded out to its current length, several later chapters are seriously below standard.  For one toothachingly tedious chapter, Berlinski appears to have skimmed Norman Cohn's great work The Pursuit of the Millennium. She manages to miss Cohn's central point--that Medieval Millennialist uprisings were specific to their time and do not support comparisons with Lenin, Luther etc.--and mines the book for examples of anti-clerical/anti-feudal revolutionaries so that she may compare them to a contemporary anti-globalization/anti-American French demagogue.  In addition, we must slog through an entire chapter on the German heavy-metal band Rammstein, so that Berlinski can point out that ... ya know ... Germans are, like ... different. 
 This is sad for me because I love her other work. And even though that last couple of books aren't as funny as they were in the beginning, they still have a plot and they make sense. I feel cheated by this series and won't be reading anymore of it.  I called my friends and told them not to read this. The plot is just too stupid, who is going to cut up a couple of NASCAR's and steal a hauler and seriously what guy doesn't have tools in the trunk of his car, even if they are just for show? Then you have a dead guy in plastic wrap and you argue about what god would want you to do with him?  The Cigar/Fruit stand ladies, are not only annoying, all the "secret" staying over is just ridiculous. The autographing was kind of funny in the 1st book but in this one it was over used and stupid. If you're hiding, you hide. In the opening of the book Barney said no body cheats her, and in the end she's sleeping with Sam who did exactly that.   I am tired of media that has women taking back cheaters or worse yet begging for a second chance. Stupid funny isn't for me and a bag of dog poop? Not funny. This book treats us like we are too stupid to care there is nothing but a bunch of slapstick going on, I might as well have watched a 3 stooges episode it would have been more fun.   There were a few times I laughed, the NASCAR stuff was interesting but the rest of it had me calling my mom mid book and asking her to shoot me.  
 I was expecting this to be the music from the movies - it isn't.  It is nicely done, but if you're expecting the same style and sound as from the movies, look elsewhere (this sounds more MIDI than orchestra) 
 The most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content, but, based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers, that most people actually believe this drivel. How can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill-informed? The answer is that we cannot. I will not bother to go through a detailed criticism, not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it, but because, in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in, no one would believe it. Today, the "truth" depends much more on one's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence. 
 This book is an OK introduction to the area real estate investment, but there are very little helpful specifics.  There are, as other reviews have noted, a lot of sales pitches for Mr. Hicks' other packages and business ventures.  Also, he is a huge proponent of getting in debt as much as possible and with poor terms and interest rates, which is a controversial way to go about things IMO.  There has to be better books out there.  Glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it 
 When I tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 I ran into a problem because I didn't have Flash 7.0 installed. Actually I had a later version of Flash (9.04) but of course Quickbooks couldn't handle that. Here's the fix: go to the Adobe site and download the uninstall program from them. Uninstall your flash player and then Quickbooks will then proceed. Good luck. Jo 
 My daughter got this for Christmas and it stopped working three weeks later!  For the price, I expected it to work more than 3 weeks.  Plus I have a very disappointed 6 year old who doesn't have a CD player anymore 
 Artsy French erotic drama is watchable but ultimately not very interesting and, worse, not very stimulating.  A young heroine, home for the summer from boarding school, is soon bored hanging around her parents' farmhouse and starts having all manner of erotic dreams.  As the film progresses, we see a mix of erotic dreams and actual erotic events, with the film leaving it up to the viewer which events are happening in the girl's head and which are actually taking place in her life.  Toward the end, it's pretty clear that most of the events are actually happening.  The trouble is, most of the girl's erotic dreams and/or experiences involve things like having earthworms rubbed into her nether regions and the girl playing with earwax, hardly the elements of classic erotica.  There are other things going on, and the movie's not a total loss, but really... if you've seen one allegorical French erotic drama, you've seen them all.  
 Unfortunately, I forked out $14 for this CD.  Upon first listen I am extremely dissapointed.  Being a huge fan of SP for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of Green's previous work.  Also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist.  Use this as Sunday background music on a rainy day; but do not expect to get the party started with this album... 
 Our dvd starts, and explains all of the rules, lets you choose a game and see the categories, but does not let you choose a category. Once we press enter to begin, it goes straight to the very first start up screen. 
 Mr. Allington claims that this book is not about the whole language versus phonics debate.  For the most part, this is a true statement.  Most of this book contains common sense recommendations that people on either side of the "great debate" support.  Mr. Allington states:  - Children need to read a lot. - Children need books that they can read. - Children need to learn to read fluently. - Children need to learn to develop thoughtful literacy.  Who would argue with these tenets?  Mr. Allington acknowledges that the National Reading Panel felt that the research reviewed had not demonstrated the benefits of sustained silent reading.  Because Allington claims his book is not about the phonics debate, he does not include phonics instruction as part of What Really Matters for Struggling Readers?  He does, however, spend time attempting to discredit research supporting a code-emphasis approach to teaching reading, including the use of decodable text.  His conclusion that there have not been studies that effectively manipulated the use of decodable text causes him to state that "claims to the utility of decodable text are sheer nonsense and not supported by the research available."  Nowhere does Allington suggest reworking the experimental design of the studies supporting the use of decodable text.  And Allington claims his book is not about whole language versus phonics.  Nonsense 
 What a boring rehash of the same old Republican lies. There was absolutely no research done to crank out this piece of, er, nonsense. I'm surprised that Regnery press didn't publish it. The man's been out of office for 5 years and he's still being slimed.  I can remember my grandparents referring to FDR as "that man" rather than speak his name 30 years after his death. I imagine that today's Republicans will be still be smearing the Clintons at least 25 years from now. Successful progressive leaders scare them more than anything else 
 This book sucks, plain and simple. There is nothing intelligent or thought provoking about it. It reeks of someonee trying way too hard to give it depth and is impossible to read. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone 
 I suppose the biggest problem with this book is that it is poor at explaining its underlying principles. Since those underlying principles are based on quantum information theory, among other things, it makes for difficult reading when the reader is not up to date with all that is current in the field. Much is implied or assumed. For me, this hurt the flow of the story.  The story is essentially a murder mystery. A human being is sent to investigate the death of a brilliant scientist on a planet where a scarce resource is found. Both the scientist and the investigator are a bit more than human. They are both the results of eugenic breeding programs and designer gene splicing. The death of the scientist is the ostensible reason for the investigation but the real reason is that everyone wants to get his hands on the data she was working on. It could conceivably turn all politics on its head. The tools at her disposal include her own ruthlessness, semi-official backing from the government and an artificial intelligence which can posses the bodies of those suitably wire for the process. In the end, her own fate as well as those of the government and other lifeforms depends upon what she finds and what she does with the knowledge she gains.  It could have been exciting but, for me, it was not. To be fair, I am not the greatest fan of mysteries to begin with and it may well appeal to others.  The author does provide a well thought out bibliography at the end which deals with matters on the quantum level. 
      The funny thing about reading these reviews is that everyone focuses on the break in at the end.  Even many pages before, all the monsters and burglars have guns and guns are a part of the "pictures".  The story line could have been cute---My husband is the biggest advocate of gun ownership and has quite a collection, however the very first thing you teach a child is never ever to point even a toy gun at anyone, especially their head.  The idea of a child watching their mother being held with a gun to her head and threatened to blow her brains out, not once but twice is totally not permissable.  Not even if you are talking about a big doggie and his bad manners!  Guns have no place on page illustrations of a child's book!! 
 I was served in square glasses at a friend's house and must say that they are visually beautiful.  There is something about the square shape which is very appealing on the dinner table.  However, figuring out how to drink from these is somewhat of a challenge.  Drinking from the edge is somewhat risky since there is nothing to channel your water into your mouth.  Unless your mouth is especially wide, it is easy to wind up with a wet lap when your drink flows right past the corners of your mouth.  Drinking from the corner is more satisfying, but somewhat uncomfortable 
 I was very disappointed with this book.The title and theme really grabbed me. What you will read are the ramblings of several peoples current life stories that are boring and unhelpful. It is like Po searched out a bunch of aimless people doing strange things.The bookis no help for a typical middle class person or a blue collar worker trying to get a foot in a new door. I am tired of publishers publishing books that never arrive at any point or recommended solution. Like the readers are just blessed to be reading stlye, good English, and punctuation. Where are the solutions?Or at least be thought provoking.This book was neither 
 This book falls into the classification of most French Revolution books that I have read. It loses focus in the complexity of the revolution and gets bogged down in way to much detail. Even if you know a lot about the revolution the analysis is too much and distracts from whatever his overall point is which was lost by about page 20.  I had a hard time getting through it and if I had not needed to read it for class I would have stopped after the first 50 pages. Try the French Revolution and the Ancien Regime by Collins for a much better look at the French Revolution.  
 Only one good story here. "Beggarman, Thief" by Mary Janice Davidson is excellent. Unfortunately, the other two stories are just REALLY bad. I found 'Stranded" offensive , not erotic. "Light on Her Toes" is just plain silly. Who wants to read a romance where you have to keep flipping to the glossary every other sentence just to understand it 
 these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought. I did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality. They also feel like they are made of cheap plastic. Definently not worth the $15 i paided for them 
 I was very excited when I read the title for this book and ordered it. Upon its arrival I read through the whole thing in about 20 minutes and was very disappointed. Her "tips" for texture techniques will work only if you are what I would call a very loose artist with no desire for detail or realism. Most of her examples look like she used a set of crayolas to paint them. I would not recommend this book to anyone except maybe an absolute beginner 
 The National Lampoon movies used to be a respected name in comedy. When Chevy Chase still knew how to be funny and have a career, he made a good name for himself in some of the classics in the Vacation series. Then, not much happened with National Lampoon for a while. Van Wilder came out and floored most audiences. While I didn't care for it too much, you can't deny Ryan Reynolds' presence in it. But then it happened: countless direct to video/dvd releases flooded the market, and left most viewers wondering what the hell happened. Shoddy sequels to some of the better known installments, yet more about college, and a few road trip ones, it all got tiring fast. And for some reason, I had a glimmer of hope in Going the Distance. It looked the least irritating (read- it didn't look like it was going to try hard to be "edgy"), and had the most decent looking cover girl for the series this year. When I popped in the disc though, I felt like I was in generic comedy city. Everything was predictable, the characters weren't anything new, the situation was ridiculous, and there was no point in watching it through to the end. I actually had to watch this one in 4 installments before finishing it. It was that mediocre.  Because the back of the box fails to give any plot details, I'll have to actually sound like I was interested enough to follow what little plot there was. The movie follows three high school grads. There's the main character who has the best intentions (Guy A), the brawny jock that just wants to get laid (Guy B/Stiffler X), and the typical stoner who tries to give a few laughs (Guy C). Guy A ended high school with his loyal girlfriend, and they were each others' first time. But once college starts up, she wants more in life, and goes for an internship from some shady business executive she met at a party. She says she'll try to be faithful to Guy A, and leaves. But he doesn't take this too well since she was his first time and everyone's like that for some stupid reason, and makes plans to travel and propose to her. Guy B and C know he's making a mistake, and take him on a road trip one day after they all get stoned. He freaks out once more, and demands they all go to see his now former girlfriend. On the way, they pick up two girls that are trying to make a name for themselves in the music industry. Fortunately, they don't want to be pop singers, and are more hippy than bubble gum. Meanwhile, Guy A's parents hire a hit man to make sure he doesn't propose to his ex, because they know she's not good for him, and want him to make a better decision. Hilarity attempts to ensue.  There's more good than bad with this movie. The group constantly loses their mode of transportation to some abnormal circumstance, and then gets an even stranger way to travel. All the jokes are simple, and rely on small bits of "gross" humor. And most of it is pretty tame, so don't come in expecting something like the American Pie gross-out humor that Stiffler had to endure. The characters are so simple, that all of their dialogue is just there so we remember that they're in the movie. Most of the lines come from Guy B, and most of it is just him going on about how he wants to score. Guy A only whines about his problems, Guy C barely does anything after the first 40 minutes, Girl A is such a perfect woman with good intentions that they may as well hang a halo on her head and get it over with, and Girl B falls in love with Guy C for on apparent reason. For those looking for nudity, you'd better look elsewhere, as there are maybe 4 short bits of bare breasts, and 3 of them are later on. Something else unforgivable is a scene where the group gets a ride to their destination with some band. A few members play a ps2 game (it looks like Armored Core), but the sound coming from the tv is obviously from the first Street Fighter II game on SNES. It's the music from China, and you hear all the old sound effects. This doesn't make any sense at all, and is a disgrace to both game series, especially Street Fighter since, well...I love that series. Even worse is the generic ponk (pop-punk) music that plagues the movie. Just when one song ends and you breath a sigh of relief, another one starts up. I should've known better since the box mentions "Special Appearance by Avril Lavigne" under the title. Luckily, she barely does anything until the end, and is never seen again. If this is what her career's down to, she's no longer a threat in modern music. Add in an ending that you can see from miles away, and you've got one forgettable movie. I can't stress it enough- if you want a better comedy for the same age demographic, go for the American Pie series, or even better- The Girl Next Door.  Since the budget for this thing wasn't that great to begin with, the visual quality isn't anything to rave about. Everything looks basic...worse than some tv shows even, and that's sad. Some backgrounds are muddy, close ups are blocky, and there's grain in the majority of the scenes. The audio's just as bad: most scenes are quiet, save the horrible soundtrack, and the mixing is so off, you'll find yourself playing with the volume on the remote every few minutes to rebalance it.  Aside from bloopers before the credits roll, the only other "extra" is 9 minutes of trailers for other MGM movies. The back of the box didn't even mention special features, so I didn't know what to expect. But hey, that means less time that the disc diseases your dvd player.  If I sound like I hated this movie, it's because I did. Sure, there were maybe 5 small laughs that I had, but that was it. I regret watching this, and will make sure to sell it by the end of the week. Things like these recent National Lampoon movies only further my mindset that I can get a movie made if crap like this does. Mark my words, after the script I'm writing, which is a disaster/zombie movie, I'll write a teen comedy, and it'll be the cure for STDs like this 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs.. 
 Did I miss something?  Clearly from the title alone Dr. Sarno believes tension and tightening of muscles is the cause of most back/leg pain.  Where is the chapter that gives you steps to change this?!  I didn't need to buy this book 
 Albeit the fact that Zig Ziglar's own MLM bit the dust, this book is great for those who would like to learn how to retail their MLM products.    Also this book does NOT cover much about the pitfalls one is bound to encounter in network marketing.

 MY CHURCH SINGLES GROUP USES THIS GAME TO BRAKE DOWN BARIERS BETWEEN PEOPLE, AND GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER ON A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL. ROLL THE DICE, LAND ON A SQUARE, PICK A CARD AND TELL A STORY FROM THAT CATAGORY OF YOUR LIFE. SOMETHING GOOD, SOMETHING BAD, SOMETHING FUNNY, SOMETHING SAD.  THEN WE PRAY FOR EACH OTHER 
  An extremely convoluted read. Another reader mentioned "dizzying" and I concur. Chock full of psyco-babble and others' personal stories that I found uninspiring.  The numerous exercises Myss requires of you to dissect past emotional events, felt somehow unhealthy and too self-absorbing. How can one be objective about the dynamics of past painful events since our perspective of them can change dramatically with time?      The author's voice was to me that of a least favorite professor in college. You know, the one class you would nod off on occasion? I took alot of effort for me to get through the first lengthy chapter, which I did, indeed, fall asleep around page 83.     However, the bottom line for me was the lack of joy in the authors words. I found Myss overcomplicating, and over intellectualizing too many fundamental Spiritual practicalities and principles. This book would seem better off in "general psychology" and not in the "Self-help/improvement" section of the bookstore. The over-analytical process could be enough to send someone in crisis over the edge.    
 After getting past Richard Light's pompous Harvard attitude, I was dismayed to be presented with nearly unpublishable material. Light's writing style, to put it mildly, is attrocious. It's hard to read for content when the author uses cliches every other sentence, rambles incoherently, and assumes a haughty air. For example, is it really necessary to use the word platitude six times in ten pages?  Light presents himself as an authority, constantly referring to himself as a statistician. He seems smug as he presents his "new" findings, which will have a profound impact on students across the country. However, anyone with common sense would have known these platitudes without needing countless surveys and interviews. According to Light, who would have thought that out of class experiences were at all imprortant? But then again, anyone with Light's intelligence might need some guidance.  I got nothing out of this book, and I don't think there was anything to get out to begin with. Maybe it was intended for faculty; as a student, I found it meaningless. Please don't waste your time reading this 
 This critically acclaimed set of short stories from Junot Diaz is at best a childish diary that was put together by incompetent editors desperate to publish anything that sounds remotely different from the monumental garbage that they continously publish every year.  The writer's main preoccupation seems to be channeling his anger about his absentee, unfaithful father and the effects on his mother in the Dominican Republic. This would be fine if it didn't read like some troubled child's diary. The writer repeatedly throws in spanish slang and sayings which I felt were used just to prove to his readers that he's bilingual as they add absolutely nothing to the plot or story, not there's any in any of the stories anyway.  The stories end abruptly, they're worst than mediocre, and he doesn't use quotations to separate his terrible dialouge. The reviews for the book were excellent but that should be expected from unqualified writers such as Junot Diaz. Critics only praise books that deal with tormented souls who use their depravity to channel it into elementary and generic prose. One must be aware that the writer is an MFA in literature, which just proves how lackluster American Higher Education has become. A terrible read 
 I read the book but gained nothing as far as understanding Wittgenstein is concerned 
 We were very disappointed in this toy.  It does not spin fast enough to make the paint spray evenly over the cardboard.  My older children had a spin art toy that was great.  It made the most spectacular designs. This is not worth the effort or money 
 I never read the book, but the CD is such a masterfully "abridged" version of the book that it manages to tell you for hour HOW WONDERFUL six sigma is, while totally neglecting to tell you WHAT SIX SIGMA ACTUALLY IS, or HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED. In short, the CD contains nothing but self-marketing bull. If you have money to waste, go buy it 
 Not worth your money. It reads like a paid advertisement. Spends way too much time talking about how great the new Jeep vehicles are and how important it is to use geniune mopar parts. Very little actual reference material for the DIY enthusiast or wannabe serious Jeeper. What little reference there is, is for CJs. Seems like something they would hand out at a Jeep dealership.   I don't agree with a lot of what this guy says. What's this about only needing 33" tires at the largest? For me, bigger, sloppier obstacles = more fun = need more traction and clearance = bigger tires.   Take my advice - aftermarket parts are almost always the way to go for price, warranty length, and reliability - don't get your parts or accessories through Chrysler/Mopar if you can help it.  I recommend Jim Allen's books, such as the Jeep 4x4 Performance Handbook. Much better intro to Jeepin' 
 this game is just a waste of time everything about this crap game gave me a huge headache think god for advil they said that it took then a long time to make this game and for what its not worth nothing cameras are very bad it makes you dizzy when you play it there also a part in this game were you have to follow a maze in pich dark all you see is the lines from the maze you fall off almost every time plus that baby crying too just does it help you. like I said just a waste of time. plus max payne looks fuuny in this game take a good look at his face it looks like he from resident evil the walking dead. and they said it took then a long time to make this game. this game should have never been release 
 Decent book if you are looking for information on the various types of welding, related equipment, etc.  Too academic if you are looking for practical information to help you start welding.  The question/answer format was a little annoying.  I felt like I was back in college taking a test 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 I went through three lessons before canning this CD.  The lessons were terrible!  Sometimes they stated the French word before the English word and sometimes afterward, which meant you could be learning the wrong word!  The pronounciations were nowhere near the way the French speak; they were like what a HS French teacher who'd learned from a book and never been to France would speak 
 This is a Wicca 101 book in disguise.  I have an interest in dream recall, alternate conscious states and lucid dreaming.  This is not what I expected.  This author teaches how to set up an altar, cast a circle and spellcast under the guise of 'dream magic'.  Nice marketing ploy 
 Clare Ballenger works as a divorce councellor, helping women find closure as their marriages fall apart, but Clare's own life is not exactly perfect. She lost her husband years before to a hunting 'accident' and has felt guilty ever since. Although two men are madly in love with her, Clare treats both of them as 'friends,' refusing to take their proposals seriously. Meanwhile, Clare's best friend, Dora has gotten back with her husband Son, against Clare's advice. Clare believes that Son can only make Dora unhappy.   Clare's batting average in terms of seeing what's going on around her falls even lower when her daughter's marriage falls apart as well. Still, Clare keeps busy building a retreat center for divorcing and divorced women on land given her by her mother-in-law. There, near the bay, Clare hopes to bring a peace to troubled women that she herself cannot find.   Author Cassandra King writes evocatively of the south, with families who have known one another for generations, instinctual distrust for imported Yankees, still-strained racial relations, and especially a kind of sisterhood. In QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS, women are the only characters with any depth--all of the men, including love interests Rhy and Lex, seem to exist only in their relationship to the women of their life. Indeed, Dory's husband Son refuses to go anywhere without his wife, and Clare's final decision between the two men who love her is driven not by the qualities of these men themselves, but by Clare's relationships with other men.   Although King's writing is strong and occasionally highly emotional, I found the story confusing and the characters sometimes unsympathetic. From the very beginning, when Clare ran out from a restaurant rather than face Son, Clare refuses to confront her own wishes and needs--which could have been the basis for a character arc, but if so, it was one King didn't fully explore.   Although QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS was occasionally frustrating, Kings writing was strong enough to propell me through the story. 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 ...upon actual research it is clearly false. Many others have delved into the finer points of Menzies' poor methodology and often deliberate exaggeration or falsities, so I won't bother. I'll only list four points that I think stand out even without deep fact checking:  1)Niccolo di Conti, the venetian explorer and crucial link in the book who supposedly sailed with the Chinese treasure fleet in 1421, failed to mention in his memoirs anything about Chinese junks or going to the four corners of the world. This seems strange.  2)The Fleet sailed to virtually every coastline in the world but missed Europe entirely, the one place sure to mark their passing for posterity. This is neither evidence nor disproof, merely a sketchy coincidence.  3)Native Americans are given startlingly short shrift, both in the book and in many of the reviews. Virtually every time something sophisticated is presented in the ancient new world it is attributed to the Chinese, reminding me of the Easter Island "mystery" of who carved those giant heads. For the record, Native populations weren't childish savages; prior to European contact they had very sophisticated civilizations, fully capable of jewelery work, cloth garments, and carving statues.  4)Lastly, Given the vast numbers of Chinese sailors involved(roughly 25-30,000), the presence of domesticated animals such as horses and pigs, and the inevitable presence of huge numbers of stow-away rats, doesn't it strike anyone as odd that there were apparently no diseases passed on to the various native populations in the Americas? It only took a very small amount of European contact to spark the largest, and deadliest pandemic in history that raged for nearly two centuries killing unknown millions of Native Americans. Chinese contact of the scale claimed would certainly have had a similar, if not worse, effect.  Ultimately Menzies' book is entertaining, leaving the reader hoping it is true merely for the fantastic nature of the thesis. In the end, however, the evidence and analysis simply are not there.  
 1- President Bush is building a base on the moon as our forward post for attacking evil aliens on Pluto. Just today we launched a ship toward pluto to start our attack.  2- A secret Cabal of Sceintologists have taken over the Defense Department and a working for Donald Rumsfeld who is actually L. Ron Hubbard come back from the dead.  3- Right Wing activists invented alcohol and drugs through funds from Jack Abramoff in order to make money for Tom Delay's trial.  4- Samuel Alito is actually Pat Robertson under a mission impossible style mask.  5- Edmund Burke and John Adams planned the JFK assination nearly 200 years before it happened and left notes in fortune cookies to tell their plans to future generations.  If you believe any of the above then you will love Brock's book. If not then its not the book for you 
 This movie was not Bill Murray's  best. I would not recommend it to anyone 
  Even when I was entering my teen years, this wasnt appealing. Its too slow, forced anger, and no damn riffs? 
 Expected more from this movie - although DeNiro was good as usual 
 I was stuck with a bad copy and nothing has been done about it as of yet. 
 I love all other Crocs styles, but was very disappointed in the Prima.  They are too slim, and look odd and stretched out on me.  They also tend to slip off in the back as I walk, yet the other styles fit me perfectly.  Great idea, but they should have worked on it more.  I can't wear these outside the house 
 The first half of DISPATCH is very interesting.  It follows the life of a young man named Jason Hanford, who can get things he wants by writing letters.  The first hundred and fifty pages of this novel shows how Hanford learns to use this power to satisfy his desires, both good and bad.  I found this part of the novel to be highly original and quite engrossing, if a bit repetitive (we get many examples of letters written by Hanford).  Unfortunately, the second half of this story veers into a very different direction.  After a long buildup, Hanford eventually gets hired by a mysterious corporation to use his power for an unknown purpose.  At this point, the novel becomes increasingly surreal and silly.  I thought the final confrontation in this book was a major letdown and had no basis in reality whatsoever.  It also doesn't help that Hanford becomes more and more unlikable as the novel progresses, doing many terrible and hurtful things.  This made it difficult for me to relate to this book on any sort of emotional level.  Also, most of the supporting characters in DISPATCH are essentially caricatures, with little emotional depth or complexity.  This is especially true of most of the female characters in this book.  For a better treatment of a somewhat similar storyline, I would suggest Stephen King's short story "Everything's Eventual. 
 I grew up reading the Chip Hilton books and loved every one of them.  A few years back, Claire Bee's daughter and her husband decided to bring them back, which was a great idea.  Unfortunately, they also decided to update the books.  If you want a great sports book for kids, find the original versions of these books and read them, instead of these updated versions.  You can tell the originals from the fakes by looking at the author's name on each book.  The originals were written by Claire Bee, the fakes are by him, his daughter and others.  One of the things I always enjoyed about the books was that they were written at a time when the rules in sports were quite a bit different than they are today.  In football, for example, if the other team scored you had a choice between having them kick off to you, or you kicking off to them.  The strategies and formations were a lot different too, and of course back in those days people still talked about good sportsmanship and it was important.  The updated books don't make much sense, since they are still using the old strategies and rules, but the books are set in modern times 
 I have just completed this book and can only say that i would not have read it had i not been required to.  It is the story of a poor man in a material world who, despite the pressures around and within him, is able to maintain a sense of dignity within himself.  The author manages to create vivd scenes of filth and vileness throughout the novel but the plot leaves something to be desired.  Characters are vague and action begins very late in the text.  Despite valiant attempts to create a classic, this book still belongs in the attic with all the other dusty volumes.  The only people i would recommend this to would be those who love descriptions and those who act too perky 
 I've never written a review before. I love the Repairman Jack novels, but this was a waste of time. I'm glad it wasn't more than $0.50. Apparently, "electronic edition" means "no editor involved." For example, on page 3, Jack checks his appearance: "NY Jets warm up Jacket over a flannel shirt, worn jeans over tan, steel-toed work boots."  Only a page later, "Jack found himself on the move before he knew it, his sneakers whispering along the pavement." I guess I missed the part where he changed his shoes.  Beyond this and other distracting errors, there was really no story. I usually enjoy Repairman Jack because there's plenty of exposition of the secondary characters' motivation, and Wilson really ratchets up the tension in his novels. None of that is here, and I don't think that's because it's a short story. This whole thing feels slapped together.  Fianlly, I'm also disappointed because I think this plot (Jack being arrested) is worthy of being part of a longer novel 
 This book carries a lot of assumptions on the authors beliefs.  It does not give practical advice on how to read auras 
 The Winner and Absolute  truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world 
 DO NOT rely on this book to pass the exam. It lightly touches most of the important subjects, but goes nowhere near deep enough to be useful. I agree is it better written that the BCSI book, but it needs to be much more thourough in its handling of the subject matter. Very poor considering its Cisco 
 The real problem of our time isn't what a terrorist believes, it's what he or she is capable of doing. A band of a few hundred or thousand terrorists can keep the entire world hostage if they are determined enough to seek, procure and use biological or nuclear WMD. Their justifications don't matter that much at all.   This book argues that Al Quaeda's justifications somehow do matter; that they seeks to kills us (the west) for what we do instead of for what we believe in. Understanding what a group of murderous zealots may or may not be motivated by is important only because in understanding them we can more easily attempt to inhibit them. But the author insists it does matter for determining policy alternatives and he goes on to suggest that if we can't destroy Al Quaeda in al all out war we should consider trading in Israel's security and handing over the Arab world to Islamist instead of to Nationalist usurpers.  The problem with the arguments in this book is that they're too emotional; at many times one feels here is someone who is upset with the direction the war on terror has taken and feels his (minority) viewpoint within the CIA has been ignored, he has a 20 year long grump to express. He admits that his editor felt obliged to edit out many of the cynical barbs and yet plenty remain.   Some of the points raised in this book are a stretch. Bin Laden's targets (The Great Satan and Israel) are dramatic abstractions to ordinary Muslims. The idea that it is justifiable to kill nonbelievers because they happen to be from Israel or the US (or Denmark for that matter) is not widely held at all. The author argues that vast numbers of Muslims are siding with Bin Laden's Jihad because it is their Muslim duty to protect the holy places from the infidels. That is nuts. The bible calls for Christians to stone the adulterers too, doesn't mean that any Christian in their right mind is actually going to do so. The author doesn't seem to have any feeling with 'reality' or 'the Muslim street'. His extremist notions are dangerous, if we were to wage the all out war vs Muslim extremism that he suggests we'd be seeing a revolution in Pakistan that could and probably would arm the faithful with nukes.   He suggests two such nutty extremist alternatives: declare an all out war on islamic fundamentalism or seek a Munich-like compromise. But the war hasn't been lost; in Afghanistan the coalition has denied Al Quaeda their primary base of operations. In Iraq the whole Muslim world watched in perplexity and often delight as the Great Satan organized the first free elections there ever. While it's too early to claim the coalition is winning the war on terror, it certainly isn't being lost.  The author's compromise alternative isn't realistic either. Western support for Israel isn't a tactical decision, it has always been about protecting the Jews against forces that seek their extinction; one cannot disregard what happened in 1948 and how bad the 650.000 Palestinian Arab and how good the 850.000 Jewish Arab refugees were treated by their own people. One has to realize that the only Arabs that have democratic rights in the Middle East are the Israeli Arabs. One has to take into account how Arab regimes treat dissent (Hama, Syria, 1982) compared to how Israel handles it. Support for Israel in the west isn't a result of excellent Israeli propaganda, it's there for the same reason that the US maintained troops in Europe after WWII; it is supranational solidarity between those who hold similar values. Only armchair philosophers like the author are too jaded to see the validity of that argument.  One can picture the author sitting as a grumpy analyst at a CIA conference table, bitterly contesting the majority view. He himself admits he's not a hands on type of person, his views are scholarly and not very well honed by personal experience. That's obvious from this book. It's a bestseller only by virtue of making the Bush administration look incompetent.  The Bush administration doesn't need any help there. Some of the criticism is deserved; why go after Iraq? Why suddenly try the kind of social engineering (implant democracy) that conservatives have always decried? Certainly it was brave to try to bring democracy to a people who have suffered so long under various dictatorships and certainly those who understand the gesture (the Kurds) fully appreciate America's intent. But democracy doesn't work when there's no large educated middle class that wants democracy and the rule of law.   We might be loosing the propaganda war for not understanding the romantic appeal of the lone religiously inspired warriors going against the huge a secular empire. Bin Laden is a hero like Che Guevara was one, a romantic with juvenile anti-establisment passions, that's why he's popular. He is winning that battle over the Muslim hearts and minds, and the western world plays right into his hand by trying to present a vast unified goliath force instead of being true to the its diverse, opinionated, free and openly  multicultural nature. We can't murder millions to kill a few, we can't sell out our friends. 
 I got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his 5th birthday, and I am appalled that I paid $50 for such a poorly made product.  They say it "transforms" into the batmobile - that is a joke!  You have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up, so why bother with that "feature" in the first place?  The whole thing is made terribly.  It barely stands upright, and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks.  None of my boys play with it, and now I am stuck with it because I don't have the box anymore to return it.  Bottom line:  this was a complete waste of money 
 The game is called Fritz and Chesster. Fritz is the boy. Chester is a rat. That girl you see in the picture, her name is Bianca. She never actually plays. She just says things like "Well done, brave knight!" and asks stupid questions. At one point poor Bianca points out that the queen is the strongest piece, and Fritz makes a comment about his mother chewing out his father. The tone and context are extremely anti-woman, in my opinion. He also counters by saying that boys are smarter.   It seems like the makers of this game were really threatened by the fact that you have to call the most powerful piece "she". To take the queen down a notch, they refer to a group or queens as a harem. To demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they have the queen run around picking flowers as fast as she can. A male voice says, "Off you go," in a tone which one can only assume is meant to accompany a little pat on her behind. 
 These five books tell the story of WWIII that pits the US & allies against China & Allies.  There are a number of things that make this a hard sell.  One problem with these novels is how long they are verses the writing style in the books. With five books you have a lot of paper to develop character depth and the author tries, but if you have read any of tom Clancy books involving Jack Ryan then you will be disappointed with the result, especially at (...) Canadian per book.  The second problem is the Chinese capabilities in the time line the author has set the events are hard to believe, especially the logistic abilities.  If you want to read this series check the library or second hand store first.  Otherwise buyer bewar 
 I bought several of Vicki Regon's tapes. She seems to be a very fun teacher and very good dancer. But the instructions are too slow-paced. There are a lot of repeats which are not necessary for DVDs and video tapes. With only 4 or 5 steps taught in each tape, if you are a beginner, I doubt "you can dance" comfortbly on the floor after you've learned from those tapes. In terms of steps per dollar, you can find much better deals on market than this series. 
 Is it just me or is American Pie becoming another National Lampoon type thing where they just create a bunch of weak, strait to DVD movies that are trying to sale based on the American Pie franchize name? About as lame as the Dukes of Hazzard sequal, Dumb & Dumberer, and the numerous Disney movies comin' out with strait to DVD release sequals to movies made like 50 years ago 
 I was really expecting to get more out of this book.  First of all, I find the Daily 16 to be an excellent workout.  I had visible results after the first few days.  The rest of the book, however, is too thin.  Outside the Daily 16, the book really was not helpful.  It has sections on recruit training and on OCS, but they are mostly photographs with little information.  Most pages have a giant photograph and only one paragraph of text.  The recruit and OCS sections merely focus on certain points of training and do not give a comprehensive overview that you would expect out of a full-size book.  The writing style is also juvenile and simplistic, almost on a child's level.  In summary, the boot camp and OCS sections (more than half of the book) are nothing new to anyone who has perused the official USMC website.  The nutrition section was a major disappointment.  All it does is provide basic nutritional information that anyone who took Health in high school already knows.  The advice is very general, with obvious points such as "drink a lot of water" and "not all fats are bad" being common.    Some example meals and diet advice that is not common knowledge would have made this section worth including.  As is, it's a half-hearted attempt to fill pages.  The title of this book is "The Marine Corps Workout."  Of its 200-plus pages, only about 80 pages (the majority of which are oversized photos) are dedicated to the workout itself.  The sections on recruit and officer training do not count, because no attempt is made in those sections to show the reader how to do those exercises.  They are merely pictures of recruits in training for entertainment's sake.  The rest of the book is just filler to make it worth selling for ten bucks.  I think most of the people who rate this book highly are rating it merely on the basis of the Daily 16.  I give the workout itself five stars, but the Daily 16 routine is freely accessible on the Internet and not worth buying a book for.  Just google "daily 16" and see what I mean.  Outside of the workout, this is the kind of book you'd pick up off the library shelf, flip through for about 15 seconds, and put back.  You do not need to buy this disappointing book 
 This is the first book by Shaara I have read. And, if his other works are like this, it is also the last.    On the cover, J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes "literature read like history and history read like literature."  He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to "pulsating life."  I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front.    I must have been reading a different book.  The first chapter, The Replacement, is a great short story.  After reading it, I had hight expectations for the book.  Unfortunately, it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view.  And, the history reads like an 8th grade textbook.   His narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived.  They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them.    After the dislocated short story of the first chapter, the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces, interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story.  It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book.  Shaara doesn't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918's, when the Americans arrive, focusing, as I noted before, primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own.  Here, however, it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective.   And, I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the American perspective on the war, but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry?  I suppose a smaller book doesn't sell as well.  For those interested in historical fiction, I would recommend Bernard Cornwall's work.  And, perhaps, Shaara can learn a bit from him 
 Just to clarify, this may be a Kool Keith release, but it's not a good one. As far as I know it hasn't been disavowed yet. There's maybe 2 songs with actual new KK material on them.  And this is NOT the FanatikJ version (which, last I heard, was still not scheduled for release), this is the "One Watt Sun" version 
 ...I told you so.  Now don't you feel silly 
 I bought this book hopeing to get into shape for my wedding, I find it dificult to follow. Yes she does map out a plan but you have to filp back and forth and practilly memorize the book before you go to the gym to get the moves down! 
 it was bad in a way but it got better. It was a cool book with a lot  of things most people would not  think of.Yeah 
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 Very dark and strange storyline. While the book attempts to present an existential perspective, it falls short.  While the writing style is possibly stylish; I found the run-on sentences and endless paragraphs difficult to read. 
 I studied from this book for over a month and only scored "average" on the PSY GRE.  It helped me brush up on a few things but while I was studying from it I found wrong information!!  On top of that, I used the internet to get more info/clarification on certain topics, and found that entire topics from this book had been cut & pasted word for word from Wikipedia (including some of the incorrect info), SCARY!  Princeton review is good for the general test, but I'd suggest finding something else to study for the psychology subject GRE 
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film 
 I am sorry, but I cant give this commentary a high mark. I am not unused to technical commentaries, I use the Word- and NIGTC-series alot. But I am always disappointed with this one. He puts alot of effort into synoptic questions and textvariants (which I am not interested in), but not much into what Luke really meant, the theology of the text and how it fits into the doctrinal big picture. I like technical commentaries because they analyze the meaning of important greek words, but this one does not. So now I am still lacking a good commmentary on Luke (Geldenhuys and Ellis wont do either). Thinking of getting the NICNT one 
 Looks great in my kitchen but I, too, only use it for shakes & smoothies.  It DOES smell like burning rubber nearly every time.  I used to think something was wrong with it and now I just disregard it.  And after less than two years or making smoothies, I'm replacing the blade & gasket assembly.  
 I absolutely love Oklahoma - one of my all-time favorites! Too bad the display is reduced to a thin 6" wide ribbon, leaving 2/3 of the screen blank. I'd really like to see product descriptions indicate the viewing size, or lack thereof! There's no way I'd purchase a mini-screen marvel if I knew better 
 After the hype on this book, I was extremely disappointed at how it rambled along with extraneous detail that never made a cohesive whole. I kept at it, hoping it would improve but alas, dear reader it does not. 
 With the elections approaching there are going to be a lot of changes in the House, Senate and among the nation's governors. Printing this almanac before the results of the election effectively makes a large portion of this book worthless.  
 I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books. 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Amanda Pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity, but otherwise this film did nothing for me. A bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests? I can't even relate. And they're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness? Yeah right! See it if you're a big fan of fart jokes, or whatever.. 
 The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures.  Some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer).  I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the LCD. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA - after 1 month? Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a DECENT camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! But if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products, look elsewhere. I used to be a great financial supporter of Sony products - monitors, computers, camcorder, memory sticks, etc. I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony and their products! Beware! Canon, here I come! 
 Aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band I've ever heard, these guys just really don't do it for me.  A lot of the music is fairly decent, but the singer is just incredibly annoying.  Now, I am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection, but this dude is really bad.  I've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that I'd rather listen to.    But like I said, the band overall isn't completely terrible.  They're decent musicians, and I like a lot of the music, but I just really cannot get around that singer.  Ordinarily, it's not a good idea to judge a band by their name, but um...this isn't one of those times 
 I like the concept that the author is trying to get the reader to think outside of our norms, but the scientific information that he attempts to incorporate into the novel are grossly off-base.  Since the author regularly skews scientific concepts to make his it makes the book seem ignorant at times.  I am in my third year of medical school and graduated undergrad with honors with a hard science degree, so I have a pretty firm science background, and I know many points in the book are inaccurate.  The author does state in the introduction that part of the book may be "bull," however, so the reader should keep this in mind and enjoy the book for what it is 
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 I would like to give this version 5 stars, i love the movie, but this is the Dimension release which only offers an English language dub. If that's OK by you, then this is the cheaper version, but if you are a purist like me, you'll want the Cantonese/Mandarin version with English subtitles 
 We used this Lonely Planet guide book on a recent trip to the US and British Virgin Islands as well as Explore Virgin Islands by Pariser. We learned about both through online reviews and bought both on Amazon.com.  Pariser's book was better; the maps are easier to use. his tips on how to get along with the locals were informative. We wanted more on the ecology from lonely planet, but turned to explore virgin islands for that. All in all, Pariser's guide had more info not found elsewhere 
 "An American Haunting" starts out as many standard horror films do - with a teenage girl being chased by an unseen assailant. She is chased into her bedroom and waits while the assailant rattles at her door. As the rattling dies down, she approaches the door cautiously (always a wise move), and then an image of a very small but full-grown girl - that bears a startling resemblance to the girl from The Ring - appears next to her. She screams, only to find herself being shaken awake by her mother.  Ah. Just a bad dream.  Her mother confiscates a doll and some papers that her daughter found in the attic, goes down to the den and begins reading the papers, which announce that if anyone is reading them, then supernatural events must be occurring (or something along those lines).  The papers go on to tell the story of the Bell Witch, as told in Brent Monahan's fictional horror novel, "An American Haunting".  We move from the present day, with the mother knocking back a shot of Absolut as she prepares to read the stories, directly back into the early 19th century, Tennessee, to the home of John Bell. We find that he has committed the sin of usury by charging 20% interest on a sale of land (wouldn't it be great if 20% was considered, today, a sin??), and the woman to whom he sold the land, Kate Batts, may be a witch. She certainly acts like one, as she lays down what sounds to me like the granddaddy of smack-down curses on him.  Almost immediately, strange things start to happen (actually, they started happening before the "curse"...sounds like squirrels in the attic). His daughter, Betsy, is visited by what appears to be a rather angry poltergeist, as it drags her around the room by her feet, holds her suspended in air, and smacks her silly.  Director Courtney Solomon, who brought us "Dungeons & Dragons", and "Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God", pulls out a bag of tricks that include black-and-white shooting when we are supposed to believe that another entity is in the room. It's not terribly convincing, and good actors like Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek fade into the background. Indeed, during one monologue, Sutherland gives what must be the worst performance of his life, which renders his character unbelievable.  If we have difficulty believing in the human characters, it's going to be difficult to believe in the "haunting", "poltergeist", or whatever it is that's making poor Betsy's life so wretched.  I kept waiting to shift back to modern time. We didn't until the very end. Those sequences were utterly unnecessary, as they lent nothing to the film.  The conclusion was utterly unbelievable, though apparently not the fault of the filmmaker; rather, the fault lies with the author of the novel. I laughed. So did my roommate. It doesn't make ANY sense whatsoever, not when you go back and remember everything that poltergeist (or whatever) did - all of the attacks, the speaking, leaving the house, etc. One could argue my last example, but I know what the argument would be and I totally disagree with it. Unfortunately, I can't go into it because it would spoil the ending, such as it is.  This gets two stars, where it might have received one. The cinematography - even the parts I would rather they have not included (black & white) - was quite good. Also, Sissy Spacek gave a strong performance, and even though Sutherland fell sharply for one monologue, he was more than adequate throughout the rest of the film. In fact, all of the actors did a terrific job with very little material. 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 Bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know.  The show was much better, you should buy that.  Kwame is much smater and deserved the job.  I can tell that this book is another promotional tool.  Don't waste even a cent on this book 
 Paralysed Age is O.K but I've heard better. "Bloodsucker 2000" is my favorite track on this CD but it all sounds rather bland and seems to cater to the misfit "goth" teen scene. Save your money or better yet get The Vampire Lucan Wolf's CD "Vampire Nights" it's alot more fun and better produced 
 Now before you shrug me off as a hater...I just want to make it clear that I love Rob Zombie...I am more of a White Zombie fan because they just have so much more going on in the music and lyrics than Rob has even come close to with his solo endevors. White Zombie made some of the most amazing music of the 90s. I like Hellbilly Deluxe, it's a very good album, not near as tantalizing as anything White Zombie did, but still very good. This album however is a complete departure from everything before it. The only good tracks are Sinners Inc & Transylvanian Transmissions, what some would call "fillers" a labeling i despise, these 2 tracks are amazing, and the ozzie track is alright, but everything else is just mindless ramblings and power cords rolled into a brainless shpeil of banter about nothing. I so do not dig this whole poppy thing hes doin in the slightest. Hellbilly deluxe is a far supirior album, while this album is not even worthy of being compared to anything White Zobmie did. Alas Rob...what happened? Why God? Why? But dont take my word for it...listen to those cuts from the tracks amazon posts. They all suck. Nuff Said...Rob...your next album better kick ass, thats all i gotta say 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 Please take this to HEART....  I love Mr. Belushi's acting, he's funny and all...I have nothing against his career and respect him for making all the changes he did in his life...  BUT...I cannot say this louder then this: NOT ALL WOMEN ARE THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was reading this, I knew what I was to expect...so I went in with SOME knowledge.   I love a real man, I LOVE A REAL MAN!!  I am NOT your a-typical woman and I will kill or die trying to remain myself.  When ever I see book after book or hear more and more about this ..... I just fume because I will be the FIRST to admit WOMEN'S LIB DESTROYED WOMANHOOD!   BUT and I repeat BUT...NOT ALL WOMEN ARE FOR WOMEN'S LIB AND ALL THE DAMAGE CAUSED IS NOT SUPPORTED BY ALL WOMEN.   I am destroyed by people like Mr. Belushi because THEY think I am one of the group called 'all women' and am judged because I belong to this group.  His book is the most selfish book I have ever read and again, do not get me wrong about being a man, I SUPPORT IT AND CAN'T STAND a man who can't be a man.... for ME, money is NOT status, a career is NOT status and marriage does not complete me!  If you fail at making the money you want, I'll encourage you to lift your spirits and NEVER tell you what job to do...if you don't have the money to take me out or buy me anything, I don't judge the quality of who you are, I will enjoy a night in front of the dvd player with you and I'M HAPPY!  I don't ask you to call because I'm checking up on YOU, I ask you to call and let me know you're safe....I don't snoop in your stuff because I'm NOSEY, I respect your privacy because I TRUST you - give me reason to stand up and NOT take your crap and I will, but ONLY after I shower you with unconditional love and acceptance because I GIVE IT TO YOU, and if that still hasn't reached you, all I can do is then stand up for myself where my man should be protecting me.   Yes, chivalry IS the key to this girls heart, but you better have a set to back that up too!   Your friends are my friends and I love them because I love you and you love them...nothing more, but they sure do take by destroying us since they don't have the 'us' in their own lives... I SUPPORT and WISH THERE WERE more real men out there...there are only two wants from this woman to her man 1-don't cheat on me and lie to my face, I NEED THAT SECURITY (pay attention, my security does NOT come from YOUR paycheck, it comes from your arm wrapped around me, PROTECTING me with your love) and 2- it is YOUR job to take care of us and when you can't, I am right there to get your back NOT to get in your way, NOT to diminish you, but to HELP YOU when you say you need my help.   That did not cost you your friends, did not cost a penny and it did not cost you your freedoms as a man.  I GIVE FREELY, LOVINGLY, UNCONDITIONALLY and ALWAYS not because of the notches on your bedpost, not because it cost you a dime, not because you did it MY way, not because you gave up one dang thing - I gave you every reason to WANT to give me your arm around me and your WANT to protect me.   Two things is all I need to give you an entire lifetime of love, honor, RESPECT and every ounce of my body to you...FREELY...got it???   I am halfway through the book and realized that yeah, I love one of the biggest jerks out there because of who he's become, I will love him til the day I die and will always and I mean ALWAYS give him that love, RESPECT as a man and honor him as MY man....because 'I' want to change ME to be a better woman, not because he got whipped into what I wanted him to be! NOT ALL WOMEN FIT THE BILL OF TRUE WAMONHOOD but I sure am dang proud of myself that I strive for it 
 This was a howler... Brown is so ignorant about intelligence gathering, computers, and NSA that there was no way to suspend disbelief and just go for the ride. Brown needs to learn to research his storylines, and then he needs to learn to write a lot better (even DaVinci Code suffered from bad writing), and he needs a better editor who will guide him on his way 
 This book is a waste of paper. It is extremely hard to follow  and it actually puts me to sleep when I read it 
 I had read all about FSM before picking up this book and bought it as more of a conversation piece.  Well, suffice to say this will never get any space with my other books as it is very poorly put together.  Flimsy cover, flimsy pages, it's put together about as well as a children's coloring book.  I too was fooled by the default picture, I thought it was a nice hard cover with a bookmark ribbon like other "religious" texts.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Hey Amazon, change the default picture to the one which shows the book as is, a flimsy cover with a picture of a hard cover on it 
 "Big Fish" is the most horrible movie ever. The only reason i couldn't go any lower than a 1 is because it can't go lower than a 1. I WOULD NOT LIKE TO BUY THIS EVER!!!!!!! 
 I found this book disappointing. The author goes to great pains to argue that it is hard to make a living in rural VT. This book seems like something the author and photographer did to pay their bills while living in rural VT, not because they had something to offer.  I found the book quite disjointed. It wasn't chronological, thematic, person-centered or anything else. I ended the book not having learned much about the people, their farming, or much else. The pictures were nice, but I wasn't really looking for a coffee table book; I was looking for a book about people farming on a small organic farm in VT, and did not get it 
 I was very disappointed with the quality of this product.  I had to request a second kit because the scented oils bottles were empty in the first kit.  The second kit also had the same problem.  Both kits had to be  returned. It is difficult to determine how fun this kit would be when it is  missing items within the kit 
 Not nearly up to the level we'd expect from Mr. Rogers. The pictures are dated and unattractive and the text is boring and uninformative. Don't be fooled by the September 1997 date--this book is a reprint of a slim volume  originally published years ago, and seems  old-fashioned to today's  children. It looks like a cheap imitation of Alison Mack's delightful and  effective TOILET LEARNING: THE PICTURE BOOK TECHNIQUE FOR CHILDREN AND  PARENTS, using tacky photos instead of Mack's cute drawings, and leaving  out the all-important section that gives guidance to parents. Mr. Rogers'  book is just the thing for parents who want to save a few dollars at their  children's expense 
 Cobbled together from out-takes, B-sides and live tracks, STILL's major problem is its lack of focus. The first half seems designed as a  'rarities'-type collection, but mostly consists of unfinished studio demos.  There are some good songs, but the selection seems entirely arbitrary and is not comprehensive enough for the dedicated fan. The second half contains a recording of Joy Division's final concert,  and while some songs such as 'Means to an End' and 'Isolation' translate well to a live setting, this performance is marred by mistakes and poor sound quality. More interesting from a fan's viewpoint is the only live performance of 'Ceremony' with Ian Curtis on vocals; it is heavier and more direct than New Order's version.  STILL does contain a handful of songs such as 'Exercise One' that are difficult to find elsewhere, but the release of better compilations such as SUBSTANCE has almost rendered this album obsolete. It might have been a better idea to combine the unreleased 'Warsaw' songs with some of the better outtakes as a 'Complete Rarities' package. 
 "Why has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?" is a movie that takes place in a Buddhist hermitage deep in the mountains. The story is pretty simple : the Master is on the brink of death and tries to impart to one of his monks enlightenment about the cycle of life and death.  It's a contemplative movie, much like the Iranian stuff Kiarostami has made popular. So what we need to look at first are the images and the atmosphere. Well, it's very dissapointing. There are sparks of beauty and raw emotion here and there, but most of the images are murky, badly framed, and sometimes a stereotypical "city is bad, rural is good" pap. The DVD itself is TV-quality, and this detracts greatly from the shots. I don't care where (South Korea) or how (with one handheld camera) it was filmed, if it looks crappy, it can't be a good contemplative movie, period.  Not only is the theme of this story based on the bad side of Buddhist teachings - the idea that we must cut ourselves from the world and progress - but the images are not nearly good enough to sustain the movie. The idea was somewhat good, but the execution is terrible. Two stars 
 I've read the entire Buddies series (as well as Mordden's satisfying "How Long Has This Been Going On?). Usually I find them interesting, sexy, and very readable - overall, an enjoyable experience. But this one just left a bad taste in my mouth.  I appreciate when intelligent and thoughtful people like Mordden share their ideas and theories about gay life and our place(s) in society. His take - which is reiterated in this latest book - is that we are a different tribe, cut off from our birth families, and  we must learn to take care of each other and form our own families of "buddies." This is all fine and good; it recalls the social theories of Harry Hay (and the Radical Faeries) and the psychological/mythical work of Mark Thompson.  The problem I had with this book is that Mordden's social theories about gay men seem, now, as rigid as the straight society he has rejected. He seems not to allow for any way of being gay outside of the rather dated and unique family structures he's created in this series. I'm thinking of the weird prevalence of daddy-boy relationships (and his consistently creepy use of the phrase "daddy-f**k"). Or about how, in this book, it's fine for impromptu orgies or 'public' sex to happen in the middle of the buddies' apartments, but the sex parties in rural Pennsyvania are contemptible, and filled with "queens" and such. Why is one okay, and the other not? And isn't the social scene these rural gay men have set up worthy of more exploration and perhaps respect, given that Mordden has explored the urban version of this over the course of many books?  I should have seen it coming, but Mordden's (yes, Mordden's, not the character Davey-Boy's, since Mordden's narrator acknowledges and does not offer rebuttal) dismissive opinion of gay marriage was saddening, and, for me, ended the book on a very sour note. I suppose  I just expected the author to me more accepting, more welcoming, more expansive in his worldview - I thought he'd be able to accept something he perhaps does not personally want. Instead, we get a diatribe against gay marriage and anyone who might want it for themselves. I'm sure this has alienated many readers, and made them feel like they're not allowed at the party Mordden is throwing. It's a shame, really, to have made friends with all these characters over the course of 5 books, and then to be told at the end that they don't in fact, like or respect you. (Yeah, I'm one of those married-in-Massachusetts types, to my partner of 20 years.)  And that porn story - the less said the better. Far too many pages taken up with its Firbankian excess. This section of the book was totally unenjoyable.  That said, I do enjoy the majority of Mordden's books, and this one had its moments - though, like others, I wish more space had been given over to the core characters 
 I cannot recommend this book.  He puts forth some interesting ideas, but it is all conjecture.  There is no scientific or historical foundation.  It's all "could be", and "might be", and "may be", which becomes very frustrating.  It also lacks focus.  It drifts from topic to topic without a coherent driving thesis.  Save your time and money 
 HOW COULD ANYONE EVER SUCUMB TO WRITING SUCH AN INSURMOUNTABLE LOAD OF NONSENSE?!?!  A SEXUAL AFFAIR IS THE MOST IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE??? NOT IRAN CONTRA, WATERGATE, TORTURE, OR WIRETAP? Noooooooooooooo, it just HAS to be what the DEMOCRATS did, not matter HOW insignificant 
 I didn't buy this book but ran through it in the store, it's very short so easy to go through in less than an hour.  It amounts to nothing but a cheap "self-help" book designed as a book about entrepreneurship.  The entire book is basically - "go out there and do it".  There's absolutely no substance and I think the reviewers who rated this highly have to be the author himself or people affiliated with him because there is no way any literate could think this book had anything of value.  You should also take a look at the source himself, his self appointed claim to to fame is 'starting' dozens of companies.  Do you know what it takes to start a company? Nothing more than a few bucks in registration and incorporation fees.  You can take a look at his so-called companies on his website and you'll see they're nothing but worthless web based businesses for the most part, the only one that isn't is his "Ford dealership consulting contract" which is some vague consulting gig for a little regional Ford dealership and not to mention his family has owned Ford dealerships for decades.  One tip he neglected to mention in his list of vague general statements was to be a success don't waste money on useless books like this 
 I only rated two stars because the book started out soooooo agonizingly slow.   I am a HUGE fan of Dessen, don't get me wrong.  But I read about the first eighth of the book and learned so little about the character and the plot that I tossed it aside.  Dessen's other books do a pretty good job of tossing you into the story and getting you into it quickly, but this one wasn't up to the test 
 As an avid reader, a feminist, and newly engaged to be married, I was thrilled to see that the third wave feminist grrls from "Bust" magazine had edited a book on marriage.   To add to my excitement it was published by the very cool Seal Press, and had a forward by my hero bell hooks.   IT WAS SEVERELY DISAPPOINTING!  Based on my previous experience, I expected honest, daring, endearing funny stories from a variety of self actualized women. Instead I got boring stories about:  how un-feminist marriage is, what last name the baby gets, and is lesbian marriage "real" marriage.   Clearly the editors didn't do a very good job seeking out QUALIFIED submissions - something with attitude, something where theory meets praxis.  To top it off even the forward from bell hooks was bland.  She discusses her legacy with feminism and leaves out discussing MARRIAGE!  A (good) book about feminism and marriage is despretly needed.  It's such a difficult area for all of us partnered thinking humans.  "Sex and the City" is doing great.  Why can't we have a book version.  And I don't think "The Rules" counts 
 Although the book is in decent condition, it is completely black and white, not to mention is is the paperback edition, and not the hardcover as advertised 
 This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car.  Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets.  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap 
 I find this book slow, superficial, and dull. I keep waiting for something to happen, especially since a lot of people really really enjoy this book - am I missing something?   I can't understand Chin's obsession with following Sarah around. I can't understand any of the characters' motivations and the plot doesn't flow, and neither do any descriptions or ideas.   I can't wait to be finished with this book so I can start a new one (I don't like putting down books, especially since I've gotten so far) 
 There were laughs in the book.  Overall I was disappointed that so much of it was recycled from her stand up shows. If she is going to expect people to lay down money for a book, the least she could do is come up with some new material.  As it is, the book is barely 200 pages and a good number of them are blank except for a section number.  Her rants on politics were not funny.  
 This is probably the worst guide book I have ever owned, and I own a lot of guide books.  I received it as a gift, and I wish I had gotten Lonely Planet, Let's Go, or Rough Guide; even Frommer's would be better.  If all Moon Handbooks are this poor, I have no idea how they stay in business.  It is poorly written--it reads like a seventh grader wrote it.  The language is flowery rather than informative, and when the writers try to include cultural or historical information, they base it on hearsay or simply get bored with writing and leave the reader wondering what the real story is (their section on Garifuna history, for example, ends in 1832--surely the Garifuna have done something in the last 171 years).  Do yourself a favor and buy a different guidebook 
 After about the first 40 pages, I skim-read this one and read the end.  It just doesn't work, and it is clear that it doesn't.  Not really anyone in the story to pull for, either, in my opinion.  With so many other options out there, not worth reading 
 I loved Borat, the Jackass movies, the Clerks movies...all offensive humor but very very funny. So I thought I would like this. I hated it! The so called jokes just didn't work. I don't think it's even the jokes themselves, but her timing, delivery, and especially her attitude of look at me, I'm so funny and bad! She's not original, just a complete gimmick with PR as slick as her black hair. How much did audience members get paid to laugh? Or maybe it's just a laugh track because the camera hardly shows the audience. It was a waste of my money and minutes of my life that I will never get back. Comedy isn't supposed to put you in a bad mood. How could I not have noticed that 87 people are trying to get rid of copies? I won't bother trying to resell it. I'm just going to throw it in the trash and watch Borat for some comic relief. 
 I was so excited about this book.  I absolutely adored Alice in Bed, I figured, 'Great, the saga continues'!  But, no it didn't continue, it stopped dead.  What happened to Schine's entertaining sarcasm and wit?  It's replaced with a sloppy writing style and silly pages containing lists of birds!  I could barely read this book.  I kept wondering where the Alice that I fell in love with went.  Louis was an annoying yet endearing character in the first installment, but now he seems to be bordering on some benign lunacy!  I didn't like anyone anymore!  A very big disappointment 
 after seeing The Guru on TV i got into the whole sex book thing i read all the best sellers from Mars and Venus in The Bedroom by John Gray to How To Get Any Girl Any Time by The Guru  these books changed my Life but in Particular this book was not so great because i and my fiance read it and found that it really was not too helpful and out dated  
 Minter is yet another biased hack who portrays himself as being unbiased and an investigative journalist when his role is to be a lackey for the right-wing. The man went to Vassar- what a waste of a fine education. Avoid this book if you are looking for the truth 
 I am rather confused that there are people who enjoyed this book.  The reviews criticizing the plot are a bit off I think - sure, it is wildly implausible and not always coherently organized, but it does have elements of originality.  The huge, massive problem that is so difficult to overlook is that the writing is dreadful.  By the sixth or seventh page, I was already appalled that this was a national book club selection.  Lots of cliches.  Lots of rambling, useless passages.  Frequently obvious and shallow in descriptions.  Attempts to introduce novel turns of phrase are usually gaudy and awkward.  Note that the book is from a minor press.  Note that the book is already heavily discounted by Amazon.  These are important signals that I shouldn't have looked over.  The book might have been salvagable, had the author tried to rewrite and if the editor had exerted any sort of influence over the dismal writing.  As currently written, it reads like a draft of a novel from someone's weekend writing group. 
 While the concept was certainly revolutionary at the time this book was written, I found the story itself uninteresting and sexist.  I would not recommend this book. 
 This is a sad attempt at modern science fiction.  I was appalled by the lack of continuity and the plotting errors.  Remainder Bin here I come 
 Every review I've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and I just don't get it.  No one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it, and by then you're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters, it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next.  If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming, then I guess I can see the appeal.  Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases.  I have to wonder what they could be: "Damned Melon!" or "I passed out when I broke my wrist, and when I woke up, the cast was already on!"???  I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor, because they say completely different things, or omit speech altogether.  In sum, don't waste your time 
 The book is great but I have to give only one star, I was very frustrated to keep reading this book, the font are too small and you need a special magnified lens so you will be able to read unless you have a very sharp eyes. Not a good book to read for old people not because of its content but because of it printing style. Not practical to use even with this low price because for me its end up to put this great book aside because I do not want to get blind!!!. this review for 1991 edition 
    I was looking forward to reading this book because of all the praise it recieved.  Perhaps my standards were too high coming into it, but I found this book to be tedious and completely unentertaining.  So many pages could have been removed that added nothing to the story.  I found the main characters personal life to be stereotypical and the story around the old man's biography was a chore to get through.  My recommendation would be to avoid this book, as I felt it was a waste of time. 
 Profiles In Courage  By: John F. Kennedy  Intorduced by: Caroline Kennedy   Forworded by: Robert F. Kennedy  	Profiles in Courage I think is about courage in battle along with politics, and J.F.K. helps  us realize that. Profiles in courage is an autobiography written by J.F.K. he talks about some of   his what I thought were inspirations. They were senators in which J.F.K. told their stories. I   wanted to read this memoir because it seemed like an interesting political book. The important   events I thought were when J.F.K. talked about the senators who made a difference and who  didn't take no for an answer.  	I think these events were important to the author because the senators he talks about   seemed a lot like J.F.K. When the author talks about the senators he talks about quotes, policies,   and things that happened while they were in office. At the beginning of every chapter there's a   quote from the senator he'll be talking about. There's one part where J.F.K. talks about the   meaning of courage and talks about courage in battle and courage in the assembly.  	The author also talks about the bad parts of courage, for example when he's talking about   WWII he brings up the fact we lost more than 300,000 troops and 300,000,000,000 in expenses.  I think the title profiles in courage means, that when you look at courage you see all these   different profiles of people who exhibited great courage like Audie Murphy or Rosa Parks.  	    	I think J.F.K. had a lot of courage because of his brother talks about J.F.K.'s days on a   PT Boat during WWII when it's attacked by the Japanese J.F.K. goes in the line of fire to save a   severely burned comrad. J.F.K. showed courage in politics and war. When J.F.K. pretty much   stopped WWIII from happening with Russia or when he saved his boat crew member. J.F.K. had   a very good political set up. When he refused to give the order for air support in the Bay Of Pigs   operation a lot of people might have died in the army but it prevented a nuclear war.  	I don't think J.F.K. could've learned anything about himself, but that's just what I think.   He might have been inspired by some of the political actions his "idols" did. I didn't really like   this book becuase i didn't get some of the politics. I wouldn't reccomend this book to people   who don't like politics or don't like books that aren't actiony. I didnt't like this book one bit   even though it's about one of my favorite political heroes.  
 This book seems be based on research done by other doctors who do not own a supplement company.  The advice is very good, although copied, but the supplement advice is to be taken with a grain of salt, (figure of speech) The supplements sold by Dr. Whitaker's company are much higher priced than the exact same supplements sold by other reuptable supplement comapanies like Puritan's Pride, The viatamin Shoppe, Swansons vitamins etc. I prefer other books on this subject sold by amazon, and written by reputable doctors doing research for heart clinics rather than a book written by a doctor who runs a commercial research instutite which is also a supplement company.

 David Mindich begins and ends his book with the assertion that objectivity, and the particular instance of journalistic objectivity, are myths that no one believes in outside of contemporary newsrooms. These  inter-related assertions of opinion sandwich a historical analysis of how  "objectivity" came to be the guiding ethic of American  journalism. Unfortunately, apart from a glib reference to Jaques Derrida,  and a terribly mistaken point on Albert Einstein, Mindich completely avoids  addressing the considerable history of philosophical objectivity in the  same historical time-frame. So we end up with a book about a profound   philosophical issue reaching philosophical conclusions but absent any real  philosophy. Irritating, yes - but also rather ironic: so inimical is  "objectivity" to Mindich, he has to forgo any objective claim for  the truth of what he says to prevent falling into self-contradiction.  Ooops 
 FROM AMAZON.CA ---------  The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer (VGE)....or at least it claims to be. My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region-free DVD player and a memory card compression utility (squeeze more saves onto your memory card). I have not used either of these features personally, but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards; some reusable, some permanently damaged. This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it. However, the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I'll get to those in a second.  The ARMax, like the newer Gamesharks, loads its software from a CD. This is a major annoyance for me. Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card (which does I don't know what) and CD, go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load, choose your codes, then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load. You can't simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down. In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down. The early generation Gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it. If you wanted it to load before the game, you turned on its switch. Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way (and it's not, btw), it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first. I mean, why can't the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you're playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don't have to load the software EVERY D@MN TIME.  Ok, rant over. On to the codes. The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark. Functionally, they are very similar of course, but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use. It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions (not for user-entered ones though, if I remember right), and a more robust Expert Mode. On big advantage, in theory, that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2's broadband connection. The upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller. The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download; its all or nothing. And since these updates are stored on your memory card (not the ARMax one), it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99% of which you will NEVER play! No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card. It's to store all the useless codes! Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work, do nothing, or lock up the game. I have come across all, though to ARMax's credit, mostly the former. The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library, when you may want just one, loses the ARMax another star. A note about manually entering codes: The sub-headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game's code list.  Finally, as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols (Amazon.ca), the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL. This happened for me as well. I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions (at the time) of ARMax. I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected. Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine, I assume any bought today would not have this problem. However, at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally. Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the CodeJunkies web site. This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars.  In my opinion, if you're in the market for a VGE, both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons. I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have. Looks at the specs, assume nothing, and don't be afraid to e-mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about.  I apologize for the length of this review, but I find there are very few in-depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print. Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs, I don't know. 
 This film is as mildly interesting as listening to Zamfir alongside the continent of Australia can be... As for the enemic story, we are in the realm of the Victorian repressed-sexuality genre. One shot explains much of the film: pan over the silent magnificence of unknown nature, RACK FOCUS to an old buttoned up lady reading geometry. Weir thinks he's getting away with this minimalist pablum but it's just a bore. Nicholas Roeg explored somewhat similar territory with much more success in his film Walkabout 
 The author fancies himself a Copernicus, by, similarly to the reversal of the notion that the sun revolves around the earth, rendering the notion of consciousness an "illusion" (last word, p.178). His ego is indeed enormous, my knowing of no other author quoting (p.45) and incessantly citing his own writing.  The notion of the sun revolving is an inference, from observing its change of position relative to the earth, and motion indeed is considered relative. But consciousness is not an inference. It is the most immediate phenomenon by which everything we know, or imagine, is manifested. Dennett persistently investigates distinctions in our brains, from dispositions to memories, often couching them in esoteric or otherwise unfamiliar terms, while sidestepping the simple fact that whatever the detailed particulars, all is presented to us through the medium of consciousness.  He puts great emphasis on the third-person approach, like questioning a subject about his perceptions, so as to discover misunderstandings about the inner workings of the mind, forgetting that all of these, whether actual perceptions or beliefs or else, are ingredients of consciousness. This his "scientific method", compared to first-person introspection, is the only approved one.  It is shared by others. Like Patricia Churchland, he has contempt for "folk" psychology, pitting it against favored "academic" (p.35). They also share a derogatory attitude toward dissenters, regarding them as reactionaries (p.8) or naysayers. The views are admittedly materialist, holding Cartesian dualism of mind and body "bankrupt" or a "disaster", as does John Searle.  Why? Descartes is not in line with their assumed all-inclusive scientific method, embraced also by philosophers, who traditionally delved deeper into issues of knowledge. I do so newly in my book and here wish to note that however physical inquiry progresses, consciousness, via which the inquiry is made, remains a distinct phenomenon. 
 I purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature. The positive reviews here are from first impressions. However, I have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use. When I first received it, it felt very light and cheaply made. I gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best. Last time it worked, the motor slowed down to almost a halt. I keep it cleaned and oiled. The motor is just too cheap. Im not sure what the company Wahl was thinking when they made this product. They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image. I would not even attempt to use my warranty because it's not defected parts. It's a total LEMON. It would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund. I would even pay the difference. I do not recommend this product 
 I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall).  Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film.  Then I noticed the cover.  I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'.  YIKES!  It is!  I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!).  If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it.  Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy 
 In his recently published history, The Whiskey Rebellion, William Hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century Whiskey Rebellion in Western Pennsylvania. What Hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of Howard Zinn. He has an axe to grind, and by the end Alexander Hamilton is the devil incarnate, and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the American Revolution to its necessary conclusion.  The accusation that Hogeland comes back to again and again is that Hamilton incited the rebellion. The argument is that because Hamilton's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen's resistance, and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion.  The problem with Hogeland's argument is his scholarship, or lack there of. He almost never offers a direct quote, especially when accusing Hamilton of malfeasance. Instead, Hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote. The reader is expected to accept on faith the author's interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end. Not all of this is Hogeland's fault. The new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting, opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop. Even Doris Kearns Goodwin, a legitimate scholar, is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze.  Ultimately, this is the main problem with William Hogeland: he is not a scholar. He is a magazine writer with an agenda, and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions. To read some radical agenda into the actions of the Pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history, because there is no basis in reality. 
 This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.  I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else...  How this book ever got a top review is beyond me.  Please do not waist your tim 
 This book and the great mass of the photos relate not to the garage, ie, a covered space where cars are stored or where a hobbyist workshop is located, but converted space or living space above a garage.  If you're interested in creative garage layout, workshop arrangement, automobile-related storage, etc., this is not the book.  If your desire is to turn a hardworking garage into a granny flat, this is for you 
 If you are looking for a good, instructional book on lighting setups and techniques...keep looking.  This book may be useful to a seasoned director or gaffer, but is rather useless for beginners.  This is essentially a book on interviews, and while has some techniques discussed throughout, is not presented in a way that would be useful for someone hoping to learn the finer details of lighting 
 overly distracting language, which constantly repeats itself in several chapters. There are good points within the book it just takes a while to reach them! 
 I agree with the post by the Latin American mom. I am a native English speaker, but even I can recognize that these songs are really dumb! Plus, the quatlity of the CD recording is terrible. If you are a Spanish teacher who is really at a loss for material you may be able to use a few of the songs, but I'm positive there's better out there. I am a Spanish minor and a Spanish-teacher-to-be, and I'm trying to find songs to use in the classroom. I would really prefer real spanish nursery rhymes. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this 
 The shoes looked wide in front but upon trying out, my toes are squashed and it can be quite uncomfortable. Nontheless, the heels are nice and presentable. Can only be worn for a short time 
 Probability Space is a very disapponting conclusion to the probability Trilogy. The two first installments definitely had their moments even though they were not up to the best of Nacy Kress' contributions, but this book reads as if it was written be a completely different author. Half of the book is a silly juvenile which could have been skipped completely and the second half doesn't answer most of the interesting questions raised in the first two books. When we leave the book we know next to nothing about those who created the space tunnels. We know next to nothing about the Fallers, and we know nothing about the new society developing on World and about those who remained there.  So who wrote this book? I guess it could be Charles Sheffield stepping in to help his wife (the writing style and the two-dimensional charachterization of persons in Probability Space matches his writing to some extent) or it could be somebody else. But it definitely was not Nancy Kress.  
 This DVD is very cheesy and I am sorry I bought it. 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 South Florida television meteorologist Bryan Norcross earned local rock-star status and even some national notoriety for his commendable reporting before, during, and after Hurricane Andrew's strike on Miami in 1992. Now Norcross has authored a Hurricane Almanac. Norcross states in the book that he hopes to produce annual updates of the book. Perhaps future editions will be better fleshed out, but the inaugural version has quite a number of rough spots.  My main issue with the book is that whenever a section begins to become interesting and useful and the reader thinks some in-depth advice and analysis is about to follow, the section ends abruptly. The reader is often then urged to check an accompanying website that Norcross has helped start in order to get more detail. But such detail is in fact not currently available on the site, which basically contains only some links to other sites where one may buy batteries, etc., in bulk. Of course Rome wasn't built in a day, and maybe the site will be far more useful in future years. But if he is going to specifically title a book "Hurricane Almanac 2006" and include repeated references to a supposedly helpful website, he has a responsibility to actually provide useful information during the 2006 hurricane season. Otherwise, it would have been better for him to just wait until 2007 and do it right.  The book seems to have been rushed into print, which might explain (though not excuse) the lack of detail. Norcross's acknowledgments imply there was a severe time rush. Perhaps the publishers and Norcross wanted to at least get something out there this year. "Something" is often better than nothing, but not always. Sometimes it's better just to say nothing rather than to give half a story.  I know a number of South Floridians who feel that although Norcross was far ahead of his counterparts at other TV stations in 1992, the gap has been narrowed or even altogether eliminated in recent years. It isn't that Norcross is unintelligent, but he has become somewhat preachy and scolding. He is given to relentlessly lecturing his audience, where some of the newer area meteorologists seem more flexible and are willing to not only constantly recite the basics, as is needed, but to sometimes go beyond them.  I mention this here because this same unhelpful patronizing attitude comes across at numerous points in the book. For instance, Norcross's first bullet point of what to do or not do during a storm once the winds reach 40 mph is not to have any open flame. True and necessary to say. But then right below that, in the "what to do when the winds reach 60" section, he says the same thing (in all caps). It's still true, but it's still also blindingly obvious. The same pattern of unnecessary repetition occurs in his almost-identical long lists of how home dwellers should deal with a storm and how high-rise dwellers should deal with one. This is more of an editing flaw than an authorial one; the editors should have condensed confusingly similar lists to one large one that is common to all circumstances, plus a few shorter ones that address problems specific to living in tall buildings, for example.  Then there is just too much plain mastery of the obvious. Consider this bit of advice from Norcross, for example: "I have a little solar-powered radio. It works well as long as it's in the sun, meaning it doesn't work well at night." Well, that's certainly another true statement. And if you're the sort of person who would normally expect their solar-powered devices to run well at midnight, it may even be news to you. But I'm betting it probably isn't.  Then there are times when Norcross throws out useful suggestions, but without enough of an explanation or follow-up. At different points he lists several ways in which a bathtub may be put to good use in a hurricane: it may be filled with water to be used later for sanitary purposes, or people may shelter themselves in it with a mattress over them for protection during a storm, or valuables may be placed in it for protection. Maybe these are each useful suggestions, taken individually. But there is no attempt made to coordinate these very different ideas. Newcomers to hurricane country might still have no idea as to who or what should actually be placed into their bathtub(s) as a storm approaches.  The book contains an overview of what tropical systems are and how they form. It has a somewhat helpful section on how to read and interpret the National Hurricane Center's various advisories and other statements. It has a brief though interesting overview of notable historical storms, which has apparently been culled from other books (especially for the pre-1870 storms). It has long sections on how to prepare for and act during a storm. These sections were to me the most disappointing; the length was in my opinion misused by constant repetition of the same few points instead of detailed explanation. The section on the various window-protection products was not nearly detailed enough (in terms of brands, etc.), and as I said the repeated referrals to the book's website provided no additional help.  Norcross also includes a section on how he would do it (better). Despite his credentials and expertise, I was mostly unimpressed by his suggestions, chiefly because most were just general concepts thrown out there without any specificity or much attempt to meet possible objections. For instance, he calls strongly for a "National Catastrophe Fund," but his fund is just a title without a program behind it. He doesn't even attempt to give any estimates of what such a program would cost, what it would cover, etc. Would it pay for people to rebuild in the still dangerous low-lying sections of flooded New Orleans, for instance? Might some landlords or investors not bother to even protect their property if they knew the government was going to come in afterwards and reimburse them for any losses? If so, couldn't the "cure" be worse than the disease, in terms of leading to still more future tragedy and loss?  The one suggestion I did find very convincing was his proposal that storm-proofing expenses be routinely added to homeowners' mortgages. As Norcross wisely points out, it's a lot more practical and possible for many homeowners to add another $10,000 to an existing $200,000, thirty-year mortgage and pay for safety that way than to come up with that same $10,000 (or more) in one lump sum. And lenders and mortgage holders should be more than willing to work with homeowners in this regard, as protecting the home protects their investment. Notice by the way that this one truly useful suggestion was the one that contained actual numerical estimates.  The word Almanac and the 300 page length might suggest to some people that this is a fairly sizeable, densely-packed work. If so, that would be an incorrect assumption. The book doesn't have half the content of a 600 page "World Almanac," for example, or even one tenth or one twentieth of such content. The print is large, the line spacing is generous, and white space predominates throughout. There really wasn't enough written to fill a whole book; it's more of a very extended FAQ or pamphlet than it is an almanac. Again, with future editions of this book this may well change. The book could serve as a good outline for what its successor books should look like. But for right now, it's not much use and I would discourage anyone from purchasing the work in its present status 
 In my humble opinion,'Born In East L.A.' is a second rate comedy.Things start happening when Los Angeles native Rudy Robles(Cheech Marin-also directed the film)is sadly mistaken for an illegal alien.So,they try to deport him back to Mexico.He tries to contact his family,but his non-English speakin cousin Javier(Paul Rodriguez)cannot help him.A few semi-comical scenes,but for the most part,this DVD is basically something to watch ONLY when you're wanting to kill some time.Cheech&Chong fans may get more out of it than I did 
 The book "Child of Fire," by Scott O'Dell is not a book I recommend to young readers. This book deals with topics that readers who are not mature enough might not understand. For example violence and drugs  are strong topics dealt with in this book. There is also a part in the book  where the topic of abortion is mentioned. This happens when Manuel's  girlfriend Yvonne tells him she's pregnant and wants three hundred dollars  for an abortion. It ends up being a lie, she just wants Manuel's money.  Either way it is still a topic that should not be exposed to young readers  in a book,but if possible by their own parents.  The book is basically  about two young boys no older than sixteen who are both leaders in rival  gangs. These two boys, Manuel Castillo and Ernie Sierra, compete against  each other to see who is braver.Manuel's way of showing bravery is by  jumping infront of a gate when the bull charges out of the tunnel.Luckily  he does not get killed but risks his life just so people can see how  "brave" he is. Ernie Sierra is a drug dealer who exports drugs  from USA to Mexico using pigeons, like the ones used to send messages. Ben  Delaney is Manuel's parole officer, who is also the narrator of the  story.Throughout the story Delaney tries to keep Manuel out of trouble. I  guess the best human concern developed  by the author is courage. Not in  the part of the two boys because killing people and selling drugs isn't  being courages,but by the parole officer Delaney. Sometimes he had to face  danger just to try to keep the two gangs from fighting.For example when he  goes to Ernie's house to prevent Manuel from killing Ernie, he is risking  his life by being caught in the middle and getting shot. Delaney is afraid  of getting shot by Ernie, but he still tries to stop him from harming  others.  Throughout the story these two boys both commit acts that are  unappropriate for children their age. Like I stated before Ernie sells  drugs and also harms anyone that gets in his way. Manuel ends up in jail  for causing a mutiny on a ship he was working on, and ends up escaping from  jail. At the end of the story Manuel Castillo ends up getting killed by a  grape picking machine. Not by accident but by displaying what he thought  was courage or bravery. He jumped in front of the machine, (just like he  did before with the bull) and did not move when it came towards him. The  machine ended up squishing him just like if he were a grape.This story  shows young readers the wrong idea of being courages, and is therefore not  a book I recommend to young readers 
 I was really excited when I saw these reading glasses that split at the nose bar, how nifty, just wear them looped over the back of your neck and click the lens part together whenever you have to read the fine print.  Great idea, but the execution of the idea is not for everyone.  The back piece is also hard plastic, rigid, and if you have long hair, you have to lift them out from under your hair and place the plastic back strip at your mid-skull level, fit them on your ears and then fit the front parts together and snap.  From the back you end up looking like you are wearing an external orthodontic apparatus.  I'd like to see the company put a string in place of the hard plastic that loops around your neck.  The magnetic clip that brings the two lenses together in the front is a fabulous idea, and having the two lenses hanging off to the sides instead of a whole pair of glasses swaying across your front is so much more comfortable and out of the way - it's just the rigid frame at the back that makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they were mass manufactured 
 I would ask that Willard Gaylin burn his mail-order psychiatric degree and take classes at a real university. How anyone can claim that he is a "leading" theoretician, educator, or anything else in the field, for that matter, astounds this reviewer beyond belief. Such praise should be considered insulting to the rest of psychiatry as a whole.  This book is not "groundbreaking." It presents no new or previously unheard-of information. All that this book accomplishes is the terrible feat of translating old assumptions and excuses about racism/other hatreds, commonly made from an anglo-saxons/Americans first ideology, and the evidence commonly used to support such assumptions into mid-level technical and medical dialogue. Not quite so advanced that the average educated reader can't understand it, but high enough to lower the burden of proof. The author's supposed medical credentials lend him even more undeserved trust.   The result is a book that encourages change, but not in the manner you'd think. Instead of decreasing or raising awareness of hatred, this book demonizes a small portion of that which it claims to fight while justifying and encouraging a great deal more of the same kind of hatred targeted at other groups and individuals.   Who cares about the situation?  Who cares about one's neurological makeup?  Who cares about the fact that violent crime rates in the U.S. are the lowest they've been since the 1960s?  Who cares about any of that?  It was written by a DOCTOR! He must be right!   Nothing's subjective at all! Those filthy arabs are just jealous of America!  It disgusts this reviewer to think that such a pile of 100% grade-A concentrated propaganda can pass as a respectable psychiatric thesis. If this is the "cream of the crop", then psychiatric medicine it might as well be flushed down the toilet.  I would have given this book a lower rating, if I could. Unfortunately, Amazon's user-rating method is incapable of going into negative numbers. 
 I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one 
 This is a good book to refresh yourself on the syntax of each language, but don't try to learn web standards from this book! It spends about 10 pages in the HTML language section talking about how wonderful tables are when used to control the layout of your entire site. Anyone with any experience in HTML knows that this is a very bad idea. The Perl section had a few things wrong in the code as well. Overall, I was not impressed with this book. I probably could have gotten better tutorials for free on the internet 
 This book was not very good.  It doesn't give enough solutions to behavior problems 
 This reissue could have been so much more. Firstly, the versions of several of these songs are markedly different from the original album, especially "I've Tried Everything." If they wanted to remix these songs, they should have just used them as bonus tracks! And the original album artwork is not here (the back shot of David Stewart is missing), as are the lyrics. And finally...these bonus tracks suck!!! They should have definately included the dance mix of 17 Again, which, here in the U.S., was the only hit version of that song!!! What a drag. 
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 None of the ideas in this book of checklists are bad, and some are quite good . . . but the volume as a whole lacks a key theme or common idea.  I also prefer a more expository writing style; the endless checklist format gets tiresome after awhile - for me, anyway.  I would look elsewhere for an introductory training book 
 I've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine. Something happened to them in early 2006 - they've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something. This magazine is absolutely terrible now. All ads, fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue, and the hilarious articles are now long gone. My last two issues (Sept and Oct) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox. I'm canceling my subscription.   
 After a Great White shark kills her youngest son, the widowed Ellen Brody comes to the realization that the shark is after her and her loved ones. As ridiculous of this might sound, it turns out that she's right. The vengeful, grudge-holding fish follows the grieving woman along with her son, daugther-in-law and niece to the beautiful Bahamas, I guess to seek revenge? For what, you ask? I have no idea.   The scathing reviews this film has received from those who have watched it are justified because this film is unbearably bad. The film-makers thought that in order to make a JAWS sequel, the story must involve the Brody family. In JAWS 2, chief Brody battled another over-grown Great White and in JAWS 3, the Brody sons battled an even bigger shark in Florida's seaworld. In JAWS: THE REVENGE, the homicidal fish returns to torment the Brody's yet again. Talk about an unlucky family. What I do not understand is why is this shark after them? Didn't the shark die in the original film? Didn't the second shark "cross over" during the sequel's climax? Is this shark somehow related to the previous sharks; maybe a spouse or a sibling or a cousin? Maybe it wanted to avenge the murder of it's relatives? Maybe "Bruce" was somehow resurrected in a Jason Voorhees/Mike Myers kind of way and the scene ended up in the cutting room floor? Help?  Another intriguing factor in JAW: THE REVENGE is that the shark roars. Mighty "Bruce" roars just like the T-Rex in Jurassic park and if that wasn't enough, it can also jump out of the water and stand on its tail, kinda like Flipper. I was waiting for Michael Caine to throw it a Mackerel and ask it to do a back-flip. Speaking of Michael Caine, he gives the most annoying performance of his entire career.   All kidding aside, JAWS: THE REVENGE is definitely the worst film in the series and qualifies as probably one of the worst sequels ever made. The acting is not too bad (Michael Caine being the exception) and I have to give credit where credit is due because you can tell that Lorraine Gary and Lance Guest were taking their roles very seriously and it's a testament to their talents that they were able to keep a straight face throughout this film.   The film's horrible climax only adds insult to injury. After her niece was nearly eaten up by the hungry fish, Ms. Brody decides to seek and kill it by herself without any weapons of any kind whatsoever. What was she expecting to do, run the shark over with her boat?   There are 2 endings to this film, both equally bad. The original ending had "Bruce" being impaled by the Brody's boat. After the film's release and for the Video editions the ending was changed and had the beast mysteriously explode upon impact. They also had Mario Van Peebles' character miraculously come back from the dead which mean this installment has the lowest body count in the series.   From the lame plot to the lame, plastic roaring shark to Michael Caine's utterly charmless performance, JAWS:THE REVENGE is a travesty of the highest order. Not even the gorgeous Bahamas locale can save this laughably bad film.   At least Michael Caine got a house out of it. The viewer is not as lucky. Skip it and re-watch the original instead. 1 out of 5.  
 Despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century, Byatt, in all her annoyingly feminist glory, has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet. Each and every character is lacking in charisma, humour and, in fact, any other attractive facet about their personality, offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy, thus leaving no hero, so necessary to such a story.    Then there's the sub-plot literature which was all, unfortunately, written by the woman herself. To interlink the text with poetry and letters is, admittedly a good idea, but the quality is dire. Could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most? And chapter 10...just too long. So unneccessary.    This is, without a doubt, the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read, and would recommend it to no-body other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea 
 THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK,SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.A PEN LIGHT WOULD DO THE SAME THING.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,OR YOU WILL LOOK AS SILLY AS ME.I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUN 
 I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book.  The book was anything but funny.  I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me.  The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it.  I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through 
 This is what happens when musicians (at least most of them) foray into fields in which they should not trod.  I had the great fortune of seeing Neil Diamond "live" shortly after the release of this movie and, like always, he brought down the house.  He just may be one of the greatest entertainers who ever graced a concert stage.  As a singer-songwriter, they don't make 'em better (Remember that he honed his craft during the golden age of the late 60's at the famous Brill Building in New York City where artists such as Carole King & Gerry Goffin, Howard Greenfield & Neil Sedaka and Phil Spector (to name just a few) were also honing THEIR crafts).  The point is that Mr. Diamond is second to none in the field of Rock/Pop Music and the day he stops recording and entertaining will be the music industry's huge loss.  As for this movie - Let me just say this:  If you take away the music sequences, what you have left is some of the most horrible stuff ever seen on film.  This movie is so inept that even a legend like Lawrence Olivier (who plays Cantor Rabinovich, Mr. Diamond's jewish father)stinks.  His acting is so 'hammy' that it's embarrasing.  I mean, when he blurts out "I hef no son!" after realizing that his son (Mr. Diamond)  is sleeping with Ms. Arnaz, I lost it!  And Lucie Arnaz?  Oh my!!  How about "I DON'T Love Lucy"?  Her acting is so amateurish that it's hard not to giggle.  And this 25th Anniversary edition dvd is not that impressive, either.  The picture quality is poor (very grainy).  The sound quality is very good, though, but the DTS will not be appreciated unless you have the surround sound system to accommodate it.  My advice is wait for a year or so until this movie comes down to $9.99 (which it will) - Even though it does have some fine extras, it just isn't worth the current price.  The best part of the film?  The "Songs of Life" sequence.  A beautiful song and a touching moment in this otherwise awful film.   
 The title and what seemed to be overwhelming praise captured my attention.  When the book arrived I was eager to read it.  I cracked the pages and my jaw dropped, not in a good way.  This book is so poorly written I am baffled  at how it ever got published in the first place.  I read as much as I could but the poor use of language and annoying blocks of italicized text made it impossible.  I returned to Amazon to look at the reviews, again.  This time, rather than just taking the star rating and "featured reviews" at face value, I really went through page by page and evaluated the reviews.  It appears that many, many kids have been assigned to write a review here at Amazon as part of a class project.    If you read through all of the reviews on this site you will see that most of them are written by children.  95% of the kids reviews have given the book a 5 star rating which has thrown off the rating.  If you pay attention to the reviews not written by children you will see that the majority of adults do not enjoy this book.  If you're between the ages of 11 and 13 you, apparently, will love this book.  If you are an adult, who knows better, don't expect much from it.  In my opinion, it is a waste of paper.  (On a side note:  A little time investigating the author brings into speculation about the veracity of his story. 
 This may be a good liner for cold weather, but is not good for the other three seasons.  The sock is too thick, and the raised toe seam may cause blisters even if worn inside out 
 We have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there. There is no rhyme or reason to the story. I gave it two stars because the landscape is great 
 As John Waters wrote in his first book, "Shock Value," 'there's GOOD bad taste...and there's BAD bad taste.' Author Jimmy McDonough may have been wise to consider this before choosing to write an entire book about exploitation flick bottom-feeder Andy Milligan.   Not that a decent book can't be written about a bad filmmaker. Rudolph Grey's bio on Ed Wood is a pretty entertaining, informative read, after all. But, as presented by the author, Milligan's world of pervs, pederasts and theater rejects becomes more ho-hum than hair-raising. We're supposed to be shocked (I think) by the depravity of these people. Instead, just as in any Milligan film, the characters are too void of life to be very interesting.  Almost worse, as this book grinds on, it almost feels as if McDonough has lost sight of the fact that Andy Milligan made really, really, REALLY bad movies. Unlike the best films of, say, Herschell Gordon Lewis, there's no spark, no wit, no fun of any sort in a Milligan flick. Milligan's defenders will use words such as "gritty" and "merciless" to describe his work, thus placing it on a higher shelf than it deserves. Well, his films may indeed be gritty, but does that really excuse the fact that they're also unwatchable? And if they're so 'merciless,' does that make it okay that they're mercilessly boring too?  The long and short of it is that if Andy Milligan had any talent at all, he sure didn't show it in any of his movies. McDonough, in writing this book, seems to have gotten too close to his subject to see this. And in the author's hands, the story of Andy Milligan and his band of misfits just never catches fire. "The Ghastly One" might be a little better than an actual Milligan movie, but that's not exactly high praise. 
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
 I was very disappointed in the condition of the book.  The book worked fine for what I wanted it for but I had to clean it up before I could use it.  There was food stuff all over it.  The pages were not only dirty but roughed up on the edges.  I felt like I paid too much for the condition it was in

  I got this magazine as a gift, starting a few months back.  I really can't say I'm impressed.    Admittedly, I'm much more left leaning than this conservative (sometimes very, very conservative) magazine.  Dispite my bias, I can still recognize good writing and well made points - this magazine generally lacks both.  This isn't to say that I've never seen a good point or anything, they're just fairly rare.  If you want to read a well-written, well-argued, conservative mag this isn't it 
 I appreciate many of the Logos School curriculum materials, along with the overall philosophy of the school.  I looked forward to reading founder Douglas Wilson's book.  At the beginning, the book was very interesting, mostly discussing what goals the Logos School has and how the school implements various curriculum to teach its students.  The author continually vaguely slams Christian schools that are basically secular but just add in Bible study/prayer time.  I think it's fair to say that most people would not want this type of Christian school, but other than bashing these schools, Mr. Wilson did not give any advice to the reader as to how to identify these schools or help to bring about change.  When I reached the chapter on homeschooling, Mr. Wilson lost all credibility with me.  Being an educator at a Christian school, I would assume he is also very familiar with homeschooling, and he in fact claims that he and his wife would choose this option, if "a good Christian school were not available."  Reading his book, the reader begins to understand that Logos School is one of the few schools in the nation that might meet this criteria.  He then goes on to say that parents teaching at home in the early years who then place their children "in a Christian school to continue their education" have fundamentally identical education principles as the Christian school.  BUT "if a home schooling family maintains that children can be given a complete education in the average home (say, K-12), then frankly there is an important difference in educational philosophy."  Boloney.  I began to see that the "difference" might have more to do with the funding of Christian schools, not the educational choices among each family.  The logic Mr. Wilson puts forth for this argument is bizarre.  He claims that a homeschool mom could be dividing her time "teaching a 12-year-old, a 10-year-old, and an 8-year-old, and she has to teach each one of them history, math, English, science, etc."  Hunh?  The homeschooling families that I know blend as many of these subjects as possible.  The only people that I know who teach each child separately in all of these subjects belong to virtual academies (publically funded schools where the children are taught at home by a parent).  Mr. Wilson claims that parents can more easily teach younger children at home but that it becomes more difficult as children get older.  "[I]t is one thing to teach your 5-year-old how to read and quite another to teach Latin to an 11-year-old."  Yes, Mr. Wilson, it is.  Teaching reading is a far more scary thought, especially considering so many schools do a poor job.  Latin's not so tough in comparison.  Additionally Mr. Wilson also claims that homeschooling parents are unable to adequately research claims of various textbooks they use to teach their own children.  I beg to differ.  Many homeschoolers can and do often refer to original material, just as one is led to assume must be done by Logos School (although there are no claims that Logos School "adequately researches" textbook claims).  Mr. Wilson interjects quotes by homeschooling experts Raymond and Dorothy Moore, and various "unschooling" theories to "prove his point."  However, these experts and theories are fundamentally opposite of the whole rigorous classical approach that Mr. Wilson promotes.  This would be similar to using quotes from (former California Governor) Jerry Brown to argue a platform of President Bush!  This book was a huge disappointment.  I believe Mr. Wilson is capable of so much more, and unfortunately, he left a very bad taste in my mouth.  Blech 
 We used this book as the text for our Mythology class. On the outside it looks like an OK book: encompassing both classic European myths with African, Asian, and Middle Eastern myths, with generous examples from each region.  However, the stories are very poorly written; it is obvious that Mrs. Rosenberg is not an author. That's fine, stick to what you're good at, but don't mangle another classic myth, please. Her diction and syntax is very simple, and her attempts at metaphors are laughable. Plus, if I have to hear the phrase "and so it came to pass" one more time, I'm going to scream. The line must appear in each story no less than 10 times.  If you want to read up on mythology, buy translations of Homer and Ferdowsi and Goethe. If this book is assigned to you as a textbook, good luck 
 I don't usally buy Buffy YA titles, I just stick to the adult ones. But I read the back cover and desided to take a gamble. And it reenforced my promise never to read Buffy YA books. Scott Ciencin spends way too much time on his own chacters, and on Dawn and Buffy, that there zero cacterzaion for anyone else, ie Willow or Xander for exsample. To the point of all the story really needed was the man's own chacters, and Buffy and Dawn. Everyone else plays such a small role I don't know why Scott put them in there at all. It was so bad I couldn't even finsh the book... 
 If one takes this work as fictional approach to secret societies and intrigue therein, then the book is entertaining.  BUT this individual wants us to take his work as a piece of non-fiction. Luckily (if this is truly non-fiction) I read this so that I now I know for sure than no woman of any intelligence would want to follow this man. I give two stars just for the look into his belief of secret society workings 
 ...Meaning, I am not enamored of this book.  It was overlong, silly, poorly written, repetitive, it had cardboard characters, and was nothing but a soap opera which happened to be set in early 20th-century Japan.  To top it off, the sex scenes were gruesome and boring.    I was hoping this book was better than the movie (which I saw first), but it wasn't.  Also, why glorify the lives of women who were basically just high-priced prostitutes, who sold their virginity and selves to the highest bidder?    Real Japanese culture could never be as dull as this book.  
 I just couldn't seem to finish this book. The others in the series I couldn't put down. Literally, I was reading until 4 in the morning. This book with Butch and Marissa just didn't hold my attention. I don't know what it is exactly. The chemistry between the characters is bland. The storyline is mediocre. It is just a huge change from the last three books in the series. I hope the next one is better.. 
 me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films. And we do really like The Thin Red Line. But this was a real boring piece of film making.....The whole film was just one huge poetry reading and I prefer to read poetry from a book.....It just doesn't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by George Lucas.Even the battle scenes were just poetry readings..........Watch Thin Red Line instead if you are interested in this director's work...That film is a masterpiece....This isn't 
 I have read the previous reviews and I am puzzled. I do not like this book at all. I have never written a review before but this book drove me to it. I am an experienced baker and tried two recipes following the instructions carefully.  Both failed miserably and I am not willing to waste the butter, or more importantly, the chocolate, to try another. My first attempt was the Paisely Brownies.  The recipe called for 12 ounces of butter (yes, ounces, not tablespoons).  While nervous about 3/4 of a pound of butter going into essentially a double batch of brownie batter, I forged ahead.  What I got was incredible greasy brownies with a gummy raspberry topping.  I figured the butter amount must have been a typo so I tried again with 12 TABLESPOONS of butter and while the brownies were less greasy, they were still mushy in the middle with a gummy raspberry topping.  Next I tried the Topsy Turvys (didn't even get around to making the sorbet or the pineapple topping).  Each attempt to mold the baked cookie into bowl shapes yielded greasy messes on my counter.  Perhaps I got the two dogs out of the whole bunch but as I have said before, I'm not willing to waste any more butter, chocolate, parchment paper, etc. on any of his recipes 
 I picked up this book because I thought it might make a nice bedtime read for the kids.  They enjoyed "The Animal Farm" a great deal on account mainly of the talking animals.  But I guess making lighthearted tales of whimsy for the children is not good enough for mister fancy writer.  This ones almost downright depressing.  Plus theres sex!  Good thing I read ahead a little bit or I would have to answer a lot of questions thats for sure.  I guess this is how they wrote books back in the 80's but it wont fly in 2006 I tell you what.    Why is there no option for ZERO STARS?!?  Oh well ONE STAR for you then Mr. Orwell 
 There is nothing wrong with the quality, brightness or cuteness factor of this product.  HOWEVER, you must plug it in and there lies the challenge.  You are obviously meant to string these lights somewhere other than on the floor.  The amount of cord that you have from the plug to the 1st butterfly is insignificant and therefore you must use an extension cord to get the lights where you want them.  If your plan is to hang them vertically, you won't have a problem.  If you want to hang them horizontally, like over a window, you need at least a 3 foot extention cord to make this work...unless you're lucky enough to have a plug in the ceiling :- 
 I'm not a cosmologist, but Stephen Hawking's Universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending.  The language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper.  Moreover, the pictures are second rate pre-contact lense Hubble knock-offs (despite being published in 1997), and the book has very little to do with Stephen Hawking.  Sure, he wrote the foreward and did some editing, but it lacks the wit and wonder of a Hawking work.  Naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading.  I AM a chemist, and despite this, Filkin's descriptions of Chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb-down ideas that aren't dumb-downable, and didn't include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts (like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration).  If you want to learn some cosmology, read "A Brief History of Time" or "A Short History of the Universe".  These are simply written but informative works that won't leave you waiting for substance 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 I loved Unity and also am fond of Into Something.  I had high hopes for this and was anxious for the reissue.  This is a lot of avant garde doodling.  There is none of the musicianship of Unity.  Unless you really like latter period Larry Young, don't buy this one 
 The refrain is "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs". Why would any reasonable person want to "Take It (America) Back" to the good old days of dialectical materialism. It didn't work then; it won't work now. I am not arguing that Carville is a "neo-Com", but there is evidence in his book to support that argument.   By the way, although Carville claims to be a "ragin Cajun", he was not born in Acadiana or even Louisiana. He hails from Georgia. He did attend LSU, but he must have flunked the courses on the Enlightenment.  This book proves that a specter is haunting America, the specter of James Carville, Howard Dean and Hillary Clinton. 
 "Pause & Effect" is a mind-numbingly shallow book.  Practically every observation the author makes in this book is either completely obvious or obviously wrong.  Definitely NOT worth the money 
 If there were, Fogel would have a chance to add a second Prize to his earlier one for Economics.  Consider this book purporting to describe the wellsprings of social improvement in America, to the present -- and  focusing on its popular, rhetorical wellsprings -- with one index entry for  "Progressivism" and none beginning "Socialism,  "Workers," or "Communism." In fact, according to Fogel  social progress has come about due to technological change and church  preachers responding to it.  Mother Jones was just a mother (my  characterization, Fogel's vacuity).     That a Nobel Prize winner could  publish such tripe I think has dumbfounded almost everyone, so little  commented upon has this book been.  But if you put stock in others'  opinions and read history, take my word for it, this is an very poor  amateur history by a non-historian with a Nobel Prize. If you don't, and  have a brain in your head, buy it and weep 
 I love sci fi, and I love Vernor Vinge, but man, I just could not finish this book.  It has some interesting details about future tech and society, but Vinge spends waay too much time on diddly details and the story never. gets. going.  I made it to the last several chapters and could not care less what happened to the characters.  Maybe one day I'll dot the "i" and finish it.  Such a shame, because "A Deepness in the Sky" is just brilliant.  Oh well... if I could write half as well, I'd be happy 
 Some people praise `We Don't Live Here Any More" as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples, tired of lies, not really knowing what to do. It is also true that Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting. The film as a result looks like a filmed version of some John Updike novels (actually it is based on two shorts by Andre Dubus, whose `Killings' became `In the Bedroom').  But sorry, Updike is not my favorite author, and the film's touch is too desultory for me. No, `desultory' is not the only real problem because I remember I was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful `In the Bedroom.' The real flaw of `We Don't Live Here Any More' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters.   Mark Ruffalo's character Jack is having affair with Naomi Watt's Edith and Jack's wife (Laura Dern) already suspects, or knows that his husband is cheating. But the affair means here uninspired, clichéd sex scenes between Edith and Jack among the woods in Oregon, with Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo having sex against a tree ala `Fatal Attraction.' Edith husband Hank (Peter Krause) teaches creative writing, and has just one book published. The alcoholism of Laura Dern's character is suggested in the most obvious way (you know what), but in the first place why didn't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big cliché?  Among these recycled materials, there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention. It is the brief, but efficient study of the children in both families, and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart. These clever, insightful moments, however, do not last long in the film, for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in America.   We don't want any big surprises, or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning. It is true that `We Don't Live Here Any More' presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in America, but the film goes nowhere from there, missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters. 
 I'm embarassed that I read this all the way through. The language/expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff. I don't live with people who talk like that, and I don't understand the purpose: "sophistication"? To my mind, the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with @%#&*s.  
 I've been robbed.  I just spent $25 for this hard cover book, and now that I finished it - I feel like burning it! I feel like the authors have jerked me around, led me along so I spent my hard earned money on their three goldarned books - and for what?  Let me explain. When you start an alternative history book on any  era, you begin with a question.  "What would have happened if something had gone differently"  . Here the authors are free to pick from the hundreds of critical events and make a point of departure.  The authors choose a very interesting one. What if Lee have listened to Longstreets advice and made a massive flanking movement to the South at Gettysburg.  The first book of this trilogy covered these fictional events with not only a truely outstanding depth of knowlege of the era, but a breathtaking mastery of suspence and pacing. This was an adventure novel of the first water. A real page-turner with such detail that you felt you were present at actual events depicted in the book. Staying well within the bounds of the possible, it was utterly convincing - even to the knowledgeable reader.  The second novel was not quite as good as the first but it still had fire and held our interest well.  The end of the second novel left the Confederacy in possession of Baltimore - America's third largest city - with a large population (which about half were sympathitic to the Southern cause)and loaded with heavy industry and the technical craftsmen that the South so desperately needed. There was a major diplomatic initutive that won the French over to extending recognition to the Confederacy - there is even some exposition on the French Emperor deciding to dispatch not only troops but state-of-the-art sea going iron clad warships from the French Navy to aid the Confederates (and secure a firmer foot hold in Mexico, naturalmont).  There was an extensive dialogue with a leading Jewish intelectual in Baltimore where some broad hints were dropped about possible last ditch efforts to arm some of the Souths blacks to refil the depleated Confederate ranks.  The second novel ends August 22, 1963. We are left with all these interesting possibilities. All these interesting avenues for the alternate history author to explore.  I bought the third novel and rushed home to read it. As I turned the pages a growing sense of dread filled me - the authors were rushing things, closing off Confederate hopes with such obvious heavy handed partiallity.   You always see this near the end of a cheap potboiler - the bad guys, who have previously been masterful and clever, quite suddenly become increadibly stupid and make mistake after mistake, while the good guys, who have struggled all the way through the book to put two and two together, are suddenly geniuses and have ever possible break falls their way.  So it was with this book. You have a stupid and drunken Southerner assigned to oversee the vitally stategic B&O railroad main yard. The crafty (and openly partison to the North) yard superintendant not only delays critical Southen supplies and troop movements, he orchestrates a major campaign of sabotage and even sends one of his men to inform the Union forces of these  critical Confederate plans - all without getting caught or even suspected by those dim wit southerners.  You could tell it was all a set up from there, the sense of credibility is gone. Everything and I mean everything goes wrong for those darn rebels. Once the authors partisonship is out in the open, it is clear that history will be repeating itself here.  The third book ends with the South's ignoble defeat- now note this carefully - Lee surrenders on August 30, 1863.   THIS IS ONLY EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND NOVEL ! You get what I mean by the authors rushing things. And that, friends, is not only straining credibility, it throws it to the winds.   To use one typical example - the Noble Army of the Potomic which after its smashing defeat at Gettysburg took a full month to recover, somehow after an even more devistating defeat is able to rest, reorganize, resupply and move into position to attack Baltimore with 15,000 troops - after just 9 days - yea, right.   The pathetic Confederates, somehow have not managed to make any improvements to Baltimore's existing fortificatins, can not seem to even delay a daylight amphibious landing, nor do they fight house to house nor deploy mobile artillery to delay the advance. On the other hand, the dashing Union calvalry, storms into Frederick, and in 3 hours whips up a bomb train to take out a stone bridge, while the stupid Confederates, who have been in full possession of Baltamore for a month, can not round up enough gunpowder to blow up a similar bridge. Thus Baltimore not only falls with hardly a shot, the entire infrastructure is intact!!??!!. Wow, what a break for the good guys ;-)   This third book is a not just a total disapointment - it is a rip-off. Having raised all these interesting ideas and giving the South two absolutely smashing (if hard faught) victories - the authors whip out the climax - the totally collapse of the Southern armies like a cheap tent in just one week.  In case anyone has forgotten, even without those smashing victories and the possession of the critical city of Baltimore, the South managed to fight on - dispite General Grants best efforts until 1865 !  This book was a cruel disappointment. There was no follow up of all the interesting ideas raised in the second book. It seems like the authors lost interest and just slapped together a jury rigged ending to please the house.  Yep - the good guys won, (yawn).  One had hoped for more courage and intelectual honesty from the authors 
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 You have to give kudos to Ms. Sher, she really does pull out all the stops on trying to figure out what you want to do with your life.  I fit into the last category of her book, those for whom "nothing interests me" was said to describe.  While she's quite blunt on the causes, she dosen't really give any concrete help on what to do about it.  And her suggestion to just remember a time when you DID find things interesting...well, if that helped I wouldn't be reading her book in the first place.  What if nothing interested you back then, either?  I mean, really?  She's very long on the theory and "pull yourself up by the bootstraps", but very short on what to do when you haven't the foggiest on what to do.  I had very high hopes for this book, and it was very disappointing 
 In a land where the cops have to run away from gun toting street gangs because the so-called law won't let them do anything about the problem, how can you consider the government anything but extraordinarily liberal (read socialist)?   If our nation's government today, or in the 1980s, had any hint of fascism in it, why does it, and why did it, encourage immigration from third world nations en masse?   And, of course, one must wonder how a nation whose foreign policy is so often determined...err...influenced by the State of Israel can be anything like a fascist dictatorship. Surely AIPAC, not to mention the SPLC/ADL/ACLU, haven't allowed us to stray from their chosen (socialist) path? 
 I appreciate the historical significance of the Kabbalistic writings in this book, but I find it to be mis-titled, since it is dealing mostly with the conjuration the angels, and the only parts pertaining to daemons say to use to power of Jehovah or whatever to "caputure" the daemons and force them to do your bidding.  This is, obviously, a very bad idea.  Daemons do not appreciate such insult.  Secondly, it is ridiculous to dapple in both angels and daemons and again, a very bad idea.  
 Like many people, I bought this book to distinguish between a very entertaining movie, Amadeus, and the truth. I am a musician and am very interested in truly talented and practiced musicians wether they be current or of historically mythic proportions. The effort and research in this book is excellent but, unfortunately, it is full of psychology and psychoanalysis which I'm not particularly interested in. It may be more interesting if it was proven data but these analyses are little more than guesses by a writer. How do you get deep, deep into the head of someone from well over two centuries ago? I'm sure some of Solomon's conclusions are valid but I kept finding myself looking to see how much more of the book I had left to go so I could say I finished it and get onto something much more pleasurable 
 I like the concept of having someone right a book that modeled the expansion and rise of Rome, it's blatant that the author did so. Even though I liked the concept the book was still bad. I think that if a differnt author had wrote this then it would have been good. Much improvement is needed, the book did not seem real, or lifelike and I was never really interested. Read something else, the Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, the Inheritance Trilogy, anything but this.  
 I bought this sight unseen based on the positive reviews here. When I got it, I thought, "Is this the right book? What were those people talking about??" And I also had some cynical thoughts that I'll withhold.   I kind of get a headache looking at this guide. It's got too many words running in all directions, the text is all different sizes, there are too many colors....it just isn't calming to look at.   Isn't that just because there's lot of streets in London? Well I was at the bookstore and looked at the Knopf mapguide, and it's much better. I don't think it omits any information; it just presents the same thing in a cleaner way. This pamphlet of maps is busy and unreadable.  The images from the "search inside" don't actually show the map. I've scanned and uploaded one of my own. I think to some extent the scanned image speaks for itself, but I don't think it captures the degree of busy-ness of the mapguide. The difference between how I feel looking at this book versus the one I saw in the bookstore is enormous. I am thinking of going back to get it, even though it's redundant. 
 While the topic is fascinating, and his use of primary sources (especially the Boston media) is laudable, the writing itself is occasionally brutal.  It reads like a first draft.  He repeats stories multiple times, and makes assertions that he does not back up.  I agree with his thesis and his conclusions for the most part, but he dismisses evidence that doesn't fit his view, and he doesn't really try very hard to determine motives.  I was hoping for a "smoking gun" in the long debate about who (probably plural) amongst Cronin, Yawkey and Higgins is responsible for this black mark in Red Sox history.  Its mainly just he-said, she-said.  If you are interested in the topic, as I am, I recommend the book.  There are a lot of interesting stories and first-hand accounts.  But you might have to cringe a few times while you are reading 
 Sounds like a man with a chip on his shoulder. A lot of pent up anger. Hardly a spiritual place to be. Jesus was innoncent too, Michael. 
 I have been a big Rumpole fan every since the PBS series, and I thought I'd give one of Mortimer's other books a try. If he could strike gold with Horace Rumpole, why not with Lucy Purefoy? Unfortunately, no such luck.  	Lucinda Purefoy is a bishop's daughter recently graduated from college. She takes an advertising job, but something is missing, so she decides to volunteer for an organization called SCRAP, Social Carers, Reformers and Praeceptors, who help former prisoners readjust to society. That's how she meets Terry Keegan who's just done four years for breaking and entering. They fall in love.  	The conflict begins when Terry tries to explain to Lucy why he got into burglary in the first place. "It's not for the money," he says, "It's  the excitement." She wants to get closer to Terry so she decides to try it for herself. She begins by shoplifting. When Terry finds out about it, the roles are reversed. Now he's the one trying to get her to go straight.   	When Terry looks down his nose at her trivial efforts, she decides to increase the stakes. There lies the problem with the book. It's just not believable; it reads more like Bridget Jones's Diary than a crime caper. I would imagine Mortimer was trying to lampoon do-gooders here, but Lucy is such a dim bulb that the reader is constantly telling himself, "She can't be serious!"  	The minor characters are worse. Lucy's father the bishop is more liberal than Teddy Kennedy. When he finds out Lucy is sleeping with Terry, he's all for it. Also, when the leader of SCRAP resigns, they solicit Terry's criminal overseer, Chippy McGrath, to take his place. Mr. Markby, Terry's parole officer, is just as clueless. These people just don't measure up to the Rumpole characters. Somebody should have had the courage to tell this to Mr. Mortimer 
 I tried this thermometer on my baby and then even on myself when I couldn't get a consistent reading.  The temperatures were so varied it was completely useless!!  Very disappointed!! I returned it without even the box 
 This book is a collection of vague and uninformative quotes, dated menus, and common sense advice.  One word for Ms Halvorsen, ICE.  The details of coffee and tea service are poured over, yet, at no time does the book remind the would-be caterer to buy ice!  It is amazing that in such a competitive publishing world that books like this are written 
 Negroponte is the man who created Wired Magazine and then had them put his face on the cover and give him made-up awards.  It is hard to point to any important discovery coming from him or the MIT Media Lab, except perhaps the invention of hype 
 Some folks need only a paper-thin plot to string together a bunch of action sequences, without character or theme or language or logic getting in the way. If that's you, this may be your movie. Xtreme sports, xtreme ops. Get it? If that doesn't strike you as xtremely clever, you may find this movie painful to watch. I'm thinking of telling The Agony Booth about it.   The humor doesn't work, to the extent that I think I want a laugh track after all. Or a drummer doing rim shots. Ba-DUM-bum! Characters are distinguishable by such things as fake national accent and stereotyped mannerisms, hair style and/or color, or shouting all his dialogue. I didn't watch it all. I didn't even watch enough to tell you what it's about. Amazon or Imdb can tell you what it's about. Just something else we found in the flat. Someone's losing credibility as a selector of DVDs. 
 This book is one that people interested in immigration policy should read.  Borjas relentlessly applies economic theory to the question of immigration, rarely pausing to think about whether he's getting a clear picture or not.  It was a fairly ground-breaking attempt to look at immigration from an economic perspective and has quite a lot of useful information.  That said, it also is a frustrating book and one that has some pretty significant flaws that should be kept in mind.  Here are a few examples.  Borjas discounts the idea that discrimination is a significant factor in the poor labor market performance of certain immigrants with no more argument than a reference to the work of Gary Becker and the claim that Becker had shown that there is no such thing as workplace discrimination.  Becker, of course, has shown no such thing but had merely provided an a prior argument which was, unfortunately, not born out by empirical enquiry.  This part of Borjas's book, then, is completely unsupported.  Borjas regularly uses operational definitions of terms (as do most economists) but without realizing how this distorts the picture and limits the inferences that can be drawn from the data.  So, he repeatedly claims that new waves of immigrants are less skilled than older immigrants, but what he means by this is just that they do less well in the labor market than did older immigrants.  This is a very unusual definition, to say the least, and makes his claims that we should try to recruit more skilled immigrants hard to understand since, on his account, this can only mean that we should recruit more immigrants who will do well in our labor markets.  He gives no advice on how to do this, nor on what this would mean as a policy proposal.  ("Skilled", on his account, does not and cannot mean "highly trained" or "highly educated".)  So, while it may well be true the more recent immigrants are less skilled than older waves, Borjas's use of an operational definition of "skilled" makes his analysis of little use.  Similarly Borjas makes a bizarre claim about how the admission of "less skilled" immigrants has imposed a loss on the US economy.  This is a bizarre claim since in order to make it he has to imagine that we might have recruited the same number of "skilled" (in his operationally defined sense) immigrants as we did "unskilled" ones in the same time period.  He then takes the difference in GDP from the real world and his totally imaginary and probably impossible one and calls this a "loss".  This is a loss only in a very funny sense- the same way in which you have a loss of a million dollars when you don't pick the right numbers on the lottery, even if you in fact won 5 dollars and so are four dollars ahead of where you were before.  Since there is no reason at all to think we could have attracted this number of "skilled" workers this cannot even realistically be called a lost opportunity.  Borjas notes this very briefly in a foot-note, but doesn't seem to notice that it makes much of his analysis in that section of the book nonsense.  There are many more examples of similar problems.  So, over all, the book is worth reading both for the useful parts, those which discuss various ways in which immigration has changed over time and how immigrants impact the economy, it has enough significant methedological flaws that it cannot be strongly recommended 
 this book wasn't all that great.  and, that's being nice.  i love horror, and it had mediocre reviews on here, so i thought i'd check it out.  i was disappointed.  it does have some good points.  i enjoyed the sections with the young babysitter and the little girl she was watching.  but, the rest just sorta sucked.  the rape scene wasnt frightening.  it was ignorant.  and, it isnt all that gory of a novel.  as for the political point, we get it.  that factor is too simple, too cliched, and too trite to mention.  also, the trying to overcome the racism aspect of the book makes the book racist in itself.  as simple as it is to read, im having a hard time getting through to the end.  and, the other reviewer on here was right, he uses the word "rump" about 117 times in the novel.  buy another book, instead.  or, do what i did, check it out at the library 
 I was getting ready to buy this cd when I looked at the song list and realized that only 2 songs are sung by Jane Horrocks.  What's up with that? I agree with Wayne Z. The truly enchanting thing about the movie was Miss  Horrocks wonderful ability to capture the essence of the original songs.  Nothing against the originals, but unless they come out with a  "soundtrack" that includes more of Janes fabulous work, I'll just  keep watching the movie 
 It's hard to sympathize with a woman who does not name her child until the baby is two weeks old (page 33), and crosses the border into child neglect by staying in a home where there is no heat or hot water in winter, and her baby's nose is "permanently streaming" (page 258).  She also lies to her boyfriend over and over, for no really good reason.  This book, for me, was 328 pages of relentless negativity.  I understand that new motherhood is extremely difficult, but to hear over and over the following:  - being with a baby is really hard (insert 10,000 examples) - we can't count on support from any grandparents because the family on both sides sucks - My relationship with my boyfriend is awful. - Lying and doing things over my boyfriend's objections is acceptable.  etc.  I couldn't stand the negativity.  Nina needed to be on Prozac or some other type medicine, and preferably in therapy.  A woman who stays in a rundown house in winter, when she has plenty of money and other places to stay, where even total strangers say to her "you're staying there with a baby?" is not someone I find sympathetic.  There is, as usual with chick-lit, a happy ending, though this one is qualified, and as in many chick-lit books I've read, it's not deserved, IMO.  There's no really good reason to believe Nina's life is looking up.  I like serious books as much as anyone else, but I want the characters to learn and grow so I don't feel I spent my time with someone who has a miserable life and just can't stop complaining about it, for hours.  Someone who never seems to take effective action.    I was relieved to close the book 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 hey Corsi, how's the weather in Tel Aviv ?  I was near finishing the first 160 (+/-) pages  that a revelation struck me: I NEED TO GET MY MONEY BACK !!!  Instead of buying this book, borrow it from your local library and you will find out why I say so; I would have appreciated if the book was written in Hebrew since at least we could say it is original.  Even Fox News couldn't do such a propaganda masterpiece 
 The book reads very textbook-y, and already that's one strike against it. There were a few interesting things, like bundling beds and the fact that Pilgrims thought that women had to climax to conceive but other than that, nothing too insightful about sex 
 Soy una gran admiradora de Miguel Bose, pero si he de juzgar su carrera en base a este CD, el pobre Miguel no sale bien librado. De las 15 canciones a dueto, solo tres valen la pena (Paulina Rubio, Alaska y Laura Pausini), las demas canciones fueron grabadas con una version tan diferente que se parece poco a la original (es lo que las hizo famosas inicialmente). Algunas de las canciones valen la pena, pero este es uno de esos CD's que habria sido mejor bajar del website de IPOD y escoger solo 3 o 4 canciones, el resto da flojera escucharlas. Reitero, me fascina me Miguel Bose 
 I began this novel with high expectations. It is very popular, and was recommended to me by friends. After the beginning I was very excited to read on. The book starts with a gripping mystery- a little boy was found hanged and no one knows who did it or how it happened. Now, when a novelist begins a book like this, one should be able to reasonably assume thee book will answer this question, that is as many writers know, called the 'implicit promise.' It is why people even bother to read a book in the first place. However Tartt fails to do so. As the story continues we learn it is actually about Harriet, a little girl on a quest to figure out what happened to her brother. What fills up the rest of the book can be summed up in a few words- South in 1970s, drugs, race, & snakes. I kid you not. It actually becomes a cat and mouse game between Harriet and the killer (and your supposed to believe that a little girl can outwit a grown man) which ends climatically enough, but that's it. Not a single word of the murder mentioned so importantly in the beginning of the book. No conclusion, no anything. I was so incredibly disappointed because she could have done so much with this book, but failed. It wasn't like some endings where you are supposed to 'fill it yourself' so to speak, just a dead end. Like another reviewer said, it makes you double check to see if any pages have been ripped out. This was the first book in a long time I felt like I had wasted my time reading. The people who seem to love it must have read a far different book than I did. (Ok, I'm off the soapbox now. 
 A failed spoof on Sci-Fi genre luckily, this is a movie about how to make movies. It is designed to teach you how to keep your actresses from losing their heads, or from losing any other appendages.   The movie's main thrust seems to be concentrated on upper torso frontal extensions (several pair). While observing this movie, I learned about the fast forward button. And suggest you do the same.   
 I can find more information in the Yellow Pages waste of money! 
 Every time I write on it holes go right through it! Dont by this! If you fold it, it rips in the fold!! Dont Buy this!!! You will be sorry 
 Interesting book, and filled with some interesting information, but the author has some strong beliefs and prejudices that flaw the book.  For one thing, for someone who is writing on a fairly controversial subject to begin with, and evidences a belief in ghosts and the paranormal, he rejects out of hand psychics and mediums, and confuses their use in paranormal investigation with magic and witchcraft.  Since the presigious Rhine Institute and the British Society for Psychical Research are investigating mediumship (and E.S.P) scientifically for decades this is a strange attitude for someone presenting themselves as a professional to have.  Also, Mr. Brandon seems to be either unaware, or lacks knowledge, of the differences between types of hauntings and methods to get rid of some of them since he expresses the opinion that there is "no way to get rid of a ghost."  I'd recommend one of Troy Taylor's books, or Joshua Warren's How To Hunt Ghosts as better, more knowledgeable, and more balanced in presentation 
 I'm 49, post-menopausal, and I love the Golden Girls, Erma Bombeck, and The View, but that type of sharp humor is not in this book. This author's humor is mild and corny, with LOTS of capitalized words. You know, for EMPHASIS! That said, it's pleasant to read. Companionable, but not terribly compelling. A nice book for the nightstand, to pick up now and then 
 I am quite disappointed with this book, considering my pediatrician's office recommends it! The recipes are unhealthy -most using honey and canned foods. The chapter devoted to making baby's first foods is not informative or helpful. A better choice is Mommy Made, which includes a guide on when to introduce foods & how to prepare them. If you're looking for a nutritional-how-to, Feed Me is NOT the way to go 
 My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of  the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a "Depot" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped & crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple. Amazon gets 5 stars, Storkcraft - 0 
 There is essentially no sound amplification.  The sound levels are barely different with the thing on as opposed to having it off.  Sort of a "what were they thinking" product 
 I don't trust this author because of all the bad press over his other books. Picked this up in a bookstore and it looks like any other toilet training book. I'll go for an author with more experience in childrearing issues just to be safe. 
 If you are looking for an inside view of the mind and man of Sam Shepard, this book really is not for you.  Granted the author had a daunting task, revealing the life of perhaps one of the most private men around.  The  thing is, I bought the book to find out about Sam Shepard.  Instead, I get  a glancing blow of his life and work.  Certain facts and sentences are  repeated four of five times, as if the editor had fallen asleep at the  wheel on this one.  Shewey tells us that Shepard's life influenced his  work, he tells us that his past influences his present, that Shepard's life  has a direct influence on what he puts on paper.  That is the thing... he  TELLS us,  he doesn't SHOW us.   If you are truly looking for an inside  view of the great playwright, check out "Hawk Moon" or even  "Cruising Paradise".  Those books, written by Shepard, will show  you the man, his life, and work.  Shewey's book makes you read points over  and over and leaves you looking for hidden pages at the end of the book.  I  literally stared at the last page and asked "Is this it?"  I  never like reviewing an author's work, because I feel as though I really  don't have the right- yet as a reader, I left this book feeling extremely  unsatisfied 
 I needed to buy this book for my graduate level class. I thought that everything that I read was information that I already knew. I guess that this book would benefit a beginner in MI but it was very dry and boring. 
 What is this all about.  I have not ordered this item nor do I have it.  Please reply 
 I am a strong admirer of Alan Dershowitz.  I especially enjoyed his books The Genesis of Justice, and Reasonable Doubts (O.J. Simpson case).  Unlike those books, America on Trial tries to do way too much.  It is more like his Contrary to Popular Opinion book, where he presents many of his earlier published commentaries on the law.    Unfortunately, I found the writings in the current book to lack the cohesiveness and well considered analysis found in the earlier book.  Granted, this is not true for every case that he presents.  However, he includes far to many cases for which he simply wants to inject a personal opinion.  In so doing, he misses opportunities for more developed theories of particular cases.  Frankly, many of his comments on some of these cases could have been presented in a paragraph.    I understand that he is trying to explain various aspects of American law by using an assortment of cases.  But, his points become obscure and sometimes repetitive by having too many cases in a format that reminds me of Reader's Digest, or U.S.A. Today.    In sum, there is not enough in this book to be useful for serious students of law or history, and too many cases for the casual reader.  I hope that this is not a sign of the dummying down of Dershowtiz.  
 The 3 leading ladies had no chemistry what so ever, even when the 3 dare share a bubble bath. The oldest daughter Tilden was the most hateful and unlikable girl I have ever seen. Not one convincing smile crossed her bland face. The lack of chemisty however had nothing to do with actress Elizabeth Perkins who is always a joy on screen. Also Scott Bakula was good too. It all boils down to heavy handed melodrama at it's dullest 
 Simple ideas.  Was not very useful for my work environment. I was looking for something that was a little different or unusual that we haven't tried 
 This was a required text for an Intro to Cinema class I took at college. To put it bluntly Gerald Mast is a bore. I've never met the guy so I'm not going to comment on what I haven't seen but I have attempted to read his writings and fell asleep before I could finish the first paragraph. I'm an avid reader and have no indications leading me to believe I have ADD or ADHD but this was simply put the worst text I have ever seen about film. The author's subject matter is not only unappealing but at times also irrelevant. For example, Mast dedicates numerous pages to many shallow commercial filmmakers and leaves one paragraph for Stanley Kubrick. I'm sorry but Stanley Kubrick's impression on the medium is worth more than a paragraph. All in all a very boring read 
 For any number of reasons I can probably say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that a lot of people think this is genius. I am not one of them. Personally, I don't find endless descriptions of sex with minority boys to be very entertaining reading, let alone genius. I also don't find pointless prose that appears to have no discernable thread of thought to have much value. Personally, I like to read good story tellers, authors like Tom Robbins or Salman Rushdie. Naked Lunch is about as opposed to them as you can reasonably get.  This is one of those books that sounds a lot better when someone translates it for you. In reading the preface where Norman Mailer talks about it in the context of the court proceedings in the 1960s, the book sounds interesting and culturally pertinent. However, upon reading it the book falls far short of the lofty status we get from Mailer's answers on the stand. I understand how Alan Ginsberg, a proclaimed NAMBLA member, would find it's material suitable. I wonder about Mailer though. While I'll never take a stand against a person's writing what they want, I do take pause when someone recommends something like this.  This is not literature so much as a heroin clouded view of the author's own serious problems and his interpretation of our culture's deficiencies. The notion that this is the "naked" truth, or lunch as it is so called, is so absurd that the book should never have been accepted as remotely resembling cult literature, in the past, present, or future. Who reads this and resonates with it? Who thinks, "Yes, gay sex with boys is what my mind is all about? Oh, and all the better that they're Arabs!" Very few people, the author included. Burroughs himself admits this was difficult to write. This is probably due to the fact that the vignettes portrayed here do not, in fact, represent anything so much as the anarchy resplendent in the author's own mind while he struggled with various addictions. As a case study in heroin and morphine addiction, this may have some merit. As a counterculture commentary on society I find it worthless.  This isn't about my sensibilities being assaulted - far from it. If I can read & enjoy Robbins's linguistic forays into sex with nuns, I can handle just about anything. I'm not offended with flying sperm so much as I am insulted that anyone felt this was worth reading; that I was lured into thinking this was a work of art. It's not.   Sometimes I read books that don't suit me, but I understand why someone would like it. This book falls squarely in the camp where people feel they need to proclaim it genius because they're so confused or intimidated by it. This book is far from genius. The author admits it was put together from scraps of things written while he was in his heavy heroin addiction, and that he vaguely remembers much of it. I don't see how, or in what context, this book will appeal to anyone other than a case study of a certain segment of people at a certain instance in time in America 
 This music chews!  And I'm complimenting him by CONSIDERING it music.  Not a tiny bit of originality in this.  I agree with the other reviewer, Mozart is way better!  And it's not a vocoder on his voice, it's a pitch correcter, also used by Cher and various other artists for the last 5 years 
 This book is pretty amusing.  Every time you read ad hominum attacks, such as those in this silly book, you realize how unsophisticated the writers are.  Even more unsophisticated: dedicating a book to someone you hate!  Now that's scholarship!  Also amusing are the reviewers who spew hatred -- you really have to get a life!  If your self-esteem was solid, you wouldn't be such a crybaby.  Boo hoo. 
 Since you can tell how I feel about this book based on the title of my review, I won't repeat everything that's been said by the other reviewers so far.  However, I will say that, as a small business owner who tries very hard to spend money wisely, I am SO NOT HAPPY that I spent close to $20 for this book that is of absolutely no value to me.  I don't want to throw it away, but I certainly can't see where anybody would want to buy it if I re-sold it. This book was a total waste of money--if there were a 0-star rating, I'd give it that without hesitation 
 My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. I was always more for historical romances. But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very "history lesson-ish") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, "So what?". Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. I honestly expected more from a bestselling author. 
 I actually saw this movie when it first came out, and was so blown away by Robert Downey Jr's performance (he was just starting out on his illustrious, if self-destructive career) that I didn't notice much else about the movie, certainly not Jami Gertz or Andrew McCarthy who are as close to being ciphers as it's possible to have on the big screen.   (The adults in the film are as cipheresque as the kids, so there is no real dramatic interest there -- we have only the kids, and their interactions with drugs, the party scene, and each other.)  Seeing it again 25 years later, well ...Downey's performance still holds up, but the rest of the movie is less than zero (sorry).  The director is so absorbed with staging endless party scenes (unintentionally hilarious in their excesses) that he forgets to give the main characters anything interesting to do, and they never develop into anyone we care about.  The final scene, with McCarthy and Gertz sitting forlornly in a cemetery, has no emotional payoff whatever-- McCarthy says come with me to the East Coast, Gertz responds yes, I'll go with you, and the viewer says, "Thank God, that means the movie's over."   Finally, James Spader doesn't play a real character either, but as other reviewers have noted, he is interestingly slimy as the chief bad guy.  Glad to see he's still getting work, in a fairly interesting role on "Boston Legal".  
 These shoes were very cute, as I thought they would be from the pictures.  But because of the sides being so short, they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking, especially when going up stairs.  I returned them after only wearing them for 1 day.. 
 Phoebe Hoban's BASQUIAT: A Quick Killing in Art is one of the few biographies of the painter whose brief career (1980-1988) coincided with the disgusting obsession with profit of the Eighties' art world. There is little here about his work itself, and in order to understand why Basquiat is so important you'll need a collection of his pictures.  The two big themes of the book are drugs and lots of sex with myriad women and men. I had the impression (like many, I assume) that Basquiat's sinking into drug addiction happened only after his corrupting fame, but Hoban reveals that he had been seriously abusing drugs since the age of fifteen. Basquiat's making an income by selling his body is also exhaustively treated, as are his relationships with Klaus Nomi, Rene Richards, Suzzane Mallouk, and others. The reader notices that a lot of things are being left out. It is obvious, and Hoban herself makes an allusion at one point, that Basquiat was somewhat well-read, but Hoban never talks about his intellectual activities or, with the exception of Cy Twombly, his discovery of his artistic predecessors.  After recounting Basquiat's death, there are two final chapters. The first describes the fights over his estate over the following decade. Hoban has Vrej Baghoomian coming out looking like quite the scumbag, and she describes the case of the several Basquiat forgeries. The chapter ends with a chilling visit to Basquiat's mother, now left extremely poor and mentally fragile even though she was entitled to fifty percent of all proceeds. The final chapter finally focuses on Basquiat's art itself, its themes and the painter's techniques. However, it isn't as substantial as other presentations of Basquiat's work.  If you love Basquiat's painting and really could care less who the man was, Hoban's biography has little appeal and that is why I have rated it rather low. I think that the book would be most attractive to those seeking to understand Basquiat in a historical context along with the 1980s art scene as a whole. That the work is very well-sourced makes it a useful guide to further research 
 I enjoy reading and listening to Ravi...however, if one is serious about theology and apologetics...this is not the book.  There are many who have written down to Ravi concerning this work, and some of their comments may be warranted.  What may be at point here is not that Ravi has some solid interior insights, but rather the presentation of his philosophy/faith.  As an avid student of theology and apologetics, I found his book at a loss for deep penetration.  Many Protestants in particular may find profit from the book due to their inclinations and history of anti-intellectualism and subjectivism of interpreting Christ, but there are Catholic theologians whom address the ideas of this book in a much deeper and real sense.  I doubt many who have reviewed this book have read a St. Thomas Aquinas, who took Aristotle's works and lofted them to the heavens.  St. Aquinas is but one of the great Catholics who have wrote of the One true God.  One reviewer had the impetus to quote the Catholic Encyclopedia...I challenge this reviewer to read some of the great Saints and see if he or she still thinks Hinduism/Buddhism are on par with Catholic (Christian) beliefs of God.  Do not be taken in by pop/new-age pluralism...their followers are as Thomas Merton writes "Birds of Appetite".  Ravi is on track, he just may have wrote to a common denominator that deep seekers are beyond in their present state.  
 I ordered this book based on the great reader reviews it had.  After receiving the book and had a chance to look at it, I am not sure why the great reviews.  A second book I ordered, "The Ultimate Windows Server 2003 System Administrator's Guide" by Robert Williams and Mark Walla is a much better book 
 I read this book because it was supposed to be one of Heinlein's classics.  I liked several of Heinlein's early works and thought I'd try this one, although I heard it was controversial.  After reading it, I can see why.  I cannot recommend this book.  It is not a classic, and if it wasn't written by Heinlein it probably wouldn't have been published, and if it was published, would have been forgotten long ago.  Other reviewers state that this is a book that questions social customs.  I'm sorry, but stories about time travel in which the protagonist meets and beds his mother as a young woman are not questioning social norms, they are the rantings of a dirty old man.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' this is not.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long are entertaining, but they don't make up for the poor quality of the rest of the text.  I regret spending money on this book, and I really regret losing the time I wasted reading it.  7MAY06 - I've added to this review after receiving a few not helpful votes, because, in part, I was concerned that my original review was too terse.  My opinion about this novel has not changed.  This is a series of stories about the life and adventures of Lazarus Long, a man who has lived thousands of years and experienced, effectively, multiple lives.  That is, he has loved, married, and 'built a life' several times.  He has now grown weary of the tedium of life and is contemplating suicide.  The novel consists of dialogue with some of his living decendants as he tells the story of his life.  Stories, really.  Each major section in the book is a vignette in LLs life.  In theory, this was a very good idea for a sci-fi novel, but in practice, this novel is simply tripe.  There are several things that I really dislike about this novel and would not recommend it to anyone.  Like much of Heinlein's later writings, this novel explores alternate family relationship (i.e. a code for incest).  As I mentioned above, one of the vignettes involves LL travelling back in time to bed his mother.  Another relates a `complex' (i.e. sexual) relationship between brother and sister.  Additionally, most of the novel is dialogue between the characters, there isn't much action.  I generally view this as a strength, not a weakness, but in this case the dialogue can be classified only as mindless banter loaded with sexual inuendo and overtone.  The characters on Beverly Hills 90210 had better lines.  If you are looking for a good science fiction novel, this is NOT IT.  This is really a novel about alternate family relationships with some sci-fi elements (e.g. longevity and time travel) in the plot.  There are some who may find this type of novel compelling, but from my perspective, the author of `Starship Troopers' and `The Puppet Masters' fell a long way when he published this novel.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long, a collection of witty saying interspersed throughout the book are great.  Judging from the other reviews, there are many who find this novel appealling.  Just be warned that this novel is very different than Heinlein's earlier classics.  There may be Time Enough for Love, but most people don't have enough time in their life to waste on this silliness 
 This is by far the most basic editing/creative package that I have ever used.  I have been using every version of Print Shop since some of their early versions.  I have Print Shop 22 and was haveing issues with printing in MS Vista.  I figured that I would be able to purchase one of Broderbund's similar products (one made for Vista) and it would be similar in style and usage.  Wrong.  I was not able to import other Print Shop projects, printing is limited, no drag and drop feature from other programs, limited editing, formating of text is off when copying from one document to another, sizing pictures and text boxes while editing projects is limited to dragging corners only, and on-and-on.  I tried to use Broderbund's tech support page, but it is very limited to their FAQ section.  Try asking a question or emailing for help; good luck.  I will fumble with this product for awhile (only because I can print more than one page at a time, because PS 22 in Vista only allows for this)and wait until the next compatible version of PS comes out for Windows Vista.  I would have thought there would of at least been a patch by now.  I think they may have made Zoom the way it is now to allow for newer, better versions.  I hope this helps...  
 Despite the product description (and even the box packaging!), the claim that this product works with the Shuffle is incorrect. IT DOES NOT WORK WITH THE NEW, TINY iPOD SHUFFLE. It only works with the old, "stick" form-factor Shuffle.   So: cool design, looks and sounds great, but does not work as advertised. 
 Ad hominem is a logical fallacy, you say?  That sounds like something a sexually deviant, financially-incompetent intellectual would say 
 I bought this book many years ago. I'm surprised it's still in print -- It should have never been in print. It is a contrived historical novel with fictional characters of zero intrest. .. 
 This book is more about bagels, than actually about MAKING bagels. I would recommend Joan Nathan's "Jewish Cooking In America" for a book that has a better recipe for bagels as well as SO much more to offer (heck, even if you are only looking for the bagel recipe her book is still a better way to spend your money) 
 It's rather dull and boring in my point of veiw.  I love musicals but the music for this one did nothing for me.  
 I was excited to see that Steven King had a new novel out.  I began the book full of anticipation, eager to enter into King's world.  However, as I began to read I became more and more unable to sustain interest in Lisey's world.  I was bored, and I gave up.  Perhaps I will try again some time;  the book is still weighing down the shelf 
 This book is plainly boring in every way. The plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. The first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. If you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then I suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like "Barney Goes to the Zoo". Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT read this book. If you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. You WILL be disappointed 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 After 3 months of use, the basket does not close properly.  I take careful precaution to make sure the basket and caraffe are properly in place but three times I have woken up to coffee and grinds spilled out all over my kitchen counter and floor because sometime during the grinding session, the basket was wiggled loose and opened.  Not only that, it is a mess to clean, as you have to take off about 6 parts and clean them extensively, especially the grinder (even when you don't use it, you have to clean it because it fills up with condensation).    Never again will I buy a grinder/coffee maker.  It's better to grind your own and just fill it with grounds.  Trust me, it's not worth the dissappointment and frustration of waking up with a huge mess to clean and no coffee to drink 
 I read this book for a political science course as a required reading. All students, with a few exceptions, found this book boring. It is difficult, perhaps Hirschman wanted it this way, to follow his choice of words, examples,and processes. It was originally published in 1970, how some can make this material relevant or useful in today's economic and political world, is difficult to process. A better, more understood, book should be out in circulation. This book, I will only say, is not part of my library 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 Backed up some movies and not even 1 played well.  They either skipped or didn't play at all.  I backed up my harddrive with one of these and some of the files won't even open... says damaged or corrupted files... ABSOLUTE JUNK!  I will stick with Verbatim from now on 
 When the background music completely overpowers the dialogue, you may as well turn it off.  The background music was piercing and I needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume.  Not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm.  A shame because otherwise I could have enjoyed Crash 
 Wissing accomplished the task of flattening the Himalayas with his two dimensional portrayal of the Sheltons, the Chinese, the Tibetans, and the continent of Asia.  He glossed over the Unequal Treaties, Opium War, or any other conflicts with the West that would cast doubt on the altruistic motives of the missionaries and ruin his "feel good" story.  The book lacked any perspective to place the Sheltons in, and thereby deprived a lot of their work of meaning.  I was left with no clue that they rode out a two revolutions, that Dr. Shelton was a great diplomat, or even how high up Tibet is, other than an occasional sideways reference.  There was a lot of potential for a very good and interesting book about Dr. Shelton, but either by accident or intent it was left with the substance of a "Chicken Soup" book 
 I approached this book with great anticipation after reading a glowing review. I found I had a hard time sustaining interest in the book. I did not find the characters to be well drawn. Ms. O'Brien seemed to be so in  love with her prose that I had difficulty understanding the motivation for  her characters behavior. This seemed more an exercise in the writing of  prose than in the crafting of a novel 
 This appeared to be a good book for beginners (I'm one!) until I began to have problems running the programs. After a few typographical errors I ran into more difficult problems in chapters 13 and 14 on functions. I first went to Que website to look for a list of errata but there was none. Later I went on line to a c/c++ newsgroup and got help. In the above chapters the functions in the examples should have been prototyped (declared before the main function) but were not. I would have more patience with this book if the publisher made some effort to correct these errors, other publishers do. This book will frustrate beginers rather than enlighten. I would not recommend this book 
 I felt the pictures were frightening along with the books references to blood, jealousy, envy, killing, dying, and in the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, there is reference to killing and removing the lungs and liver for the Queen.  I think this is really scary stuff for children and totally inappropriate.  Can't there be beautiful fairy tales without the fear, horror and violence, and always a prince coming to the rescue of the helpless princess.  
 You will first encounter one of the biggest lines of BS when you read Elvis Costello's foreword where he describes Mr. Emerick at the end of the second paragraph: "You could not meet a more modest and self-effacing man". If Geoff Emerick truly has such qualities you'll be hard pressed to find it in this book because the journeyman hack he hired in writing this piece of rubbish does too well of a job in presenting him as completely the opposite. Other reviewers have mentioned the constant fawning over Paul McCartney at every opportunity, the absurd trashing of George Harrison and Ringo Starr at every other opportunity, and the insensitive denouncing of John Lennon in between those opportunities. The put-downs he throws towards George Martin are just childish. This is such an annoying book that halfway through, this long-time Beatles aficionado who was greatly looking forward to reading it had to stop. To paraphrase George Harrison, "it's a drag, a well-known drag... 
 There are many baseball books on the market that include statistical analysis of hitters and offensive production.  Any baseball enthusiast who buys this book hoping for a Bill James-like analysis and commentary on baseball's best hitters will be highly disappointed.  Strauss uses only four metrics for evaluating and ranking players across the past century, but half (two) are based on a faulty premise.  Total Run Production (TPR) is based on the simple addition of Runs and RBIs; Strauss then normalizes this total by dividing it by a player's at bats for comparison purposes between players.  The thinking behind TPR is that it measures the batter's hitting skill of driving in other players on base and also getting on base to score runs.  The problem is the double counting of Home Runs.  Based on the Strauss metric a Home Run counts as a Run and RBI, although only one run is scored by the team by the hitter.  According to the Strauss metric the act of hitting a solo HR is equivalent to a player who triples in another runner, and then scores on a subsequent play.  The former play accounts for only one real run, but a total of two runs for purposes of the TPR total; the latter play truly accounts for two runs (1 run, 1 RBI). The TPR fault is then compounded as the basis for another metric.  The result is a too high rating of home run hitters and too low a rating for hitters who hit for average without home run power.  Strauss' evaluation process also fails to take into account ballpark effects, hence the high ratings and rankings of players like Todd Helton and Larry Walker, or the fluctuation of offensive production over time, hence the dominance of players from the 1920s to early 1930s and the late 1990s.  All-time greats like Willie Mays and Honus Wagner are hurt by this disregard of ballpark and time affects.  Hack Wilson is helped, playing in the friendly confines of Wrigley Field and having his best season in 1930 when everyone had fantastic statistics.  Even if the statistical is overlooked, Strauss provides very little commentary or personal analysis.  Most of the book is little more than yearly or lifetime batting count totals that can be found in a host of other books.  
 I ordered the Cobra HG A1500 High Gear CB Antenna. They keep sending the Cobra HG A1000. Now I'm stuck with a antenna I did not order nor do I want. 
 The photos are indeed beautiful,(kudos to Martin Brading) but overall the book left a bad taste in my mouth upon realizing that this book is more a testament to the authors than to the testament of the art of yoga. The beauty that comes from the art of yoga is its transformative magic - not just physical transformation, but spiritual transformation. It's difficult to see that when the pictures are pretty much just glamor shots.<P.. 
 The author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the Chamber of Commerce or a right-wing think tank. Like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. In his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. He is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. He finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. His low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. Most in the West do care. Rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment.   Though the author's real target is US society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. And of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. A country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. But it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the US.   In the US, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. In actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. In this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. He contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. It is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at Wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. The actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the Wal-mart juggernaut.   He especially decries direct citizen actions. He is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. However, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. It's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of Congress to accumulate vast sums. If citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. The theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as American as apple pie. His view that such unelected bodies as the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve Board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. Who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the Fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? No, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it.   If the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. First and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. It is not surprising that Americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. The list could go on. Informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. The US most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. This is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore.   It is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. Americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. Yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. The book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.  
 The title and premise of this book is to put Family First. Yet I just read an interview with Dr Phil in one of the major national woman's magazines. He says - very proudly - that in all the years of their marriage he has only spent a day or two with his wife's sister and her family because he prefers to stay home and let his wife visit on her own. He feels time with them is wasted and he put his foot down from the very start of their relationship that he would not visit them. So, that is putting family first??? How incredibly sad for his wife, her sister and all their children. The entire clan has suffered because of his attitude. And what a shame that he sells this attitude as good advice 
 After reading the glowing reviews of this book, I truly expected something special.  I was deeply disappointed.  Some of the reviews that praised this book were written by reviewers with whom I almost always agree.  I don't know why we had such a radical disagreement on this book.  Personally, I found this book to be contradictory and "preachy".  First the author spends a great deal of time talking about how wonderful solitary practice is because it allows you find your own path and walk your own personaly journey.  Then she launches into a tirade about all the things you have to do or you are not Wiccan.  The information about the Craft is not always correct and I don't know where some of her information comes from.  I don't want to make it sound like the entire book is worthless, I just question a lot of what the author says.  I also question her basic editorial approach.  On to the writing: this was the greatest failure of the book to me.  I question many of the "facts" presented (poor research or just the desire to be slanted?) in the book, but it was the actual writing itself that truly fell flat.  The author clearly believes that she's an awesome writer and researcher, but her work does not support this.  The book contains a lot of instruction ("carefully grind the flowers..."), but very little explanation.  There is a lot of "how" but very, very little "why".  It really strikes me as a poorly written 101 book although the author spends a great deal of time stating this is not the case.  It consists of a lot of recipes for various things but lacks any depth or substance.  Again and again I keep coming back to the poor quality of the writing and research.  Perhaps the author had to rush this book to print or something, but the lack of polish is striking.  The lack of reasonable consistancy is also a problem.  Even if this were an ordinary 101 book, I would have some complaints.  When the author gives instructions, they are incomplete and sometimes downright silly.  For example, she gives instructions about creating a magical wash solution.  To use it, she says "If you intend to mop your ritual area, add nine drops of this wash to the water.  Otherwise, prepare a spray bottle as follows: Add nine drops to a spray bottle of spring water and shake to blend" (p.27).  There is no explanation as to why you should do this or how it will help you.  How much water should you use?  A spray bottle and mop bucket are quite different.  If the ratio of "wash blend" to water doesn't matter, why not?  Honestly, doesn't this sound like instructions from any run of the mill 101 book?  How can the author expect us to view this in any other way?  For a book that the author emphatically states is not a 101 book, why would you include such simple silliness?  Wouldnt anyone who has moved past the most basic stages of Wicca know how to cleanse a space (and hopefully with a much better technique than this)?  To me, this type of instruction (which dominates this book) is more akin to Anna Riva than any legitimate authority on Wicca.  Why nine drops?  Will it fail to work if you use 6 drops or 12?  Again, an ordinary 101 book would get poor marks from me for this type of writing and information, but the author keeps proclaiming that this is not a 101 book.  I just can't see how she justifies this belief when the book is page after page of writing like I've quoted above.  In short, as much as I hate to say it, this book simply did not work for me.  Perhaps it will for you, but I found the information to be pedestrian at best, explanations inadequate, and the entire book a poorly researched Wicca 101 effort.  I have not given up on this author.  Perhaps this wasn't her best effort and her other books will have better research and writing.  This book simply did not fulfill its promise.  I have already ordered another one of her books (sadly, before I had read much of this one), so I hope she took the time to get a writing coach and a research assistant, or whatever she needed that was missing from the writing of this book.  I will continue to trust the reviewers who praised this book and I'll just assume that this was an instance where they saw something I had missed.  The book isnt a total waste of time, but Cunningham and other authors have done a much, much, much better job of presenting the solitary path than this author 
 This movie is one of those "just for entertainment" category films. The plot is simple and the story is sort of interesting. Well, it was interesting to me. I'm sure that lots of folks will think it's goofy. Watch it if you have nothing better to do. 
 I read this and not surprisingly found it rather shallow. Eric sees the downfall of the WCW brought about by the Merger of Turner and Time Warner, whereas in reality the WCW had been in decline for a long time when that happened. If you want a better read on the fall of the company read, The Death of WCW, a very good read and very informative book. 
 Tedious.  Oh my GOSH, this was tedious.  It was words (many, many words) in search of a story.  Or an editor. McCoy is one of my favorite characters, and I wish this book had been about him and not someone else named McCoy.  The concept was great: two timelines, McCoy trapped in the past, and McCoy living in the Star Trek "present" having never been trapped.  The execution, though, was horrible. Someone might try to write this off as a character study rather than a plot-driven story, but even that's botched. McCoy isn't recognizable as McCoy, he's crippled by something a Jr. High Psychology student could diagnose, and all the things that could and should provide conflict are ignored.  Anyone remember the "fundiscopic examination" scene in the third movie that nails McCoy's attitude to 'witch-doctor medicine"? This author didn't because his McCoy has no trouble with primative medicine.  His character already believes he's irredeamably screwed up the future, so why bother trying to minimize damage by living a boring life (for hundreds of pages)? Do something spectacular with your future knowledge!  I'll pass on the other two Crucible books 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 I puchased the LS 100's to get a decent speaker for a great price. I was disappointed. I knew the bass response would not be astonding but it was almost non existant. The midrange and the highs are scratchy.   I would not recommend the speakers for anything other than talk radio 
 Sorry, I really wanted to like this book, since I've had a horrible experience writing code to handle audio on a PC (.wav files, audio sampling are much messier and less intuitive than need be). I AM an expert at DSP, having done it for over 25 years, with many hardware/firmware designs under my belt. I would not have slammed this book for one simple reason. The code examples are buggy and crash. Yikes, the fellow rails on Microsoft and the low quality of their compilers. His code does not work.  Sorry, I tried, I really did, but this book mostly text describing C++ classes which are on the CD. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands - just get a decent DSP book (Antoniou, oppenheim). Try Embree or Rorabaugh if you want books with DSP code in them. 
 It leaks from the top,barely drips from the pump.....but it looks great 
 I bought this book as it was a required text for my Animation 101 course. While it's interesting because it was written (and drawn) by the creator of Roger Rabbit, it's quit boring if you are not enthusiastic about animation. It focuses on drawing techniques to help cel animation, but does not touch on any computer animation which is why I gave it 2 out of 5 stars.   If you are a serious artist interested in cartoons, live drawings, and animations, this book is a great reference tool. (Especially for creating walking sequences.) For those of you like me who prefer creating things on the computer, you'll be disappointed. 
 I first read Clavell's Shogun when I was twelve years and it sparked within me a life long interest in East-Asian culture. In many ways he helped bring me to Japan, where I have lived for a total of eight years. However after reading his works for many years, I was quite bored with Gaijin, which I never finished. I perused through the book looking for interesting points but found little. His messages in his other works were repetitive in this one. Amongst them are his criticisms of western culture through an Asian perspective. I grew tired of hearing how sexually repressed white-anglo-saxon-protestants are when compared to their Asian counter-parts, and thought my reading time was too precious to sit through another lengthy reading of how East meets West. Some of my friends in Japan have read Gaijin and liked it; but after owing so much to this writer, I am sorry that I could not say more of this work. 
 While this book does offer spiritual keys to happiness, they mostly seem to be suggestions that we have all heard before, such as using your imagination, surrounding yourself in color, and learning to fully appreciate everything in your life.   I think that the happiness keys that could truly evoke some interior changes in a person are underemphasized, only mentioned in passing as though change is easy to undertake, while the book focuses mostly on material pleasures.  Yes, fine table linens, cafe lattes, fountain pens, and antiques purchased in Provence do make people, but should we bank our happiness on what we own?  The author mentions her fine stationery, antique furniture, and colorful clothing all throughout the book, conveying the idea that we can choose happiness by buying objects that make us happy.  This take on "happiness" makes consumerism far too important.  The book lacks insight into emotions that are not based on reflections of what we own or surround ourselves with, and therefore, I think this book seems to be mostly about money, because it's foundation seems to lie in what material objects you can own to make your happiness, that the goal isn't really "choosing happiness" so much as BUYING happiness 
 The book, Lipstick Jihad by Azadeh Moaveni is a very interesting and factual book. It tells the story, in first person, about an Iranian girl living in America, and then after college, moving to Iran. But instead of feeling comfortable in her home country, she feels like an American foreigner living in Iran.             While in America, Azadeh only remebers Iran vaguely, and remembers happy times there. Once she moves to Iran, she discovers the country is confused, filled with politics, and in an emotional struggle. She is a journalist and describes the difference between Iranian and American culture, such as womens' rights, and how they clash with each other. She talks about Iran's strong laws people live by, social codes, public etiquette, and the Islamic revolution that changed her country.                                                     This nonfiction book really shows the clash of the two cultures. For anyone who is interested in other countrie, thick government analysis, and how they are run, then this is a great book for that 
 right now i can't even get my burner to open because one of these dvd's is in it, caused an error while burning... now, stuck. i thought for a few days that my burner was broken, but figured out that it is the sony dvd's... i don't get it either because my dvd burner is also sony, you would think they would be compatible. i am so annoyed that i bought two big stacks of these... 
 What a lot of self indulgent drivel. I can't believe that a great mystery writer like Rita Mae Brown actually wrote it.My computer forced me to give it a sta 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 Sewn into the hem of an eighteenth-century cloak stored away in a museum, curators in the early twenty-first century discover twelve pages of handwritten notes, in code. When eventually deciphered these pages seem to indicate that shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin paid an unemployed dock worker a sum of money to murder, thereby silence, the lowly-born woman who had given birth to Franklin's illegitimate son William. The notes are apparently the minutes kept at a sort of judicial hearing attended in secret by Washington, Hamilton, Adams, and Madison, in order that the question of Franklin's guilt or innocence, and what to do about the accusation, be decided. Are the pages a modern forgery, an eighteenth-century hoax, or did one of the most beloved Founding Fathers truly spill blood to preserve his reputation? I wish I knew. After finishing this novel, I still don't. Lehrer wastes his first eighty pages on flimsy character building, then it's true he finds his stride for about the next hundred, but the trouble is, I'll tell you now, the ending is one of those variety that makes your head hit the table, because it's so frustrating. Books that fail to answer questions are rudely-composed. Why write what you don't finish? 
 I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through).  It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere.  I do not recommend this book 
 I would trade this book in for one done on the same topic by somebody else. Zaloga is generally tops in the field, but other books in this series give you more for the money. For example, US Army Infantry Divisions of the same series gives you far more detail. Mr. Zaloga should take a look at that book before doing more - a new and higher standard exist. 
 While the story was nice and the characters interesting.  I really resented the fact that the historical details were really off base.  I study gothic tapestries and have written many papers on them, and I worry that people who read this book might think it was real. 1. the tapestry was woven between 1480 and 1490 which means brussels would not have been the center of tapestry weaving at this time.  The prevailing expert theory is that this tapestry was woven in Arras, which has given its name to big tapestries which is why you sometimes hear them referred to Arras in England.  2. the earliest recorded evidence of a low warp loom was 1501 before that they use high warp looms or Haute Lisse.  Low warp looms were referred to as Basse Lisse.  Which means that the tapestery would have been woven on a high warp loom or vertical loom, not a low warp loom, or horizontal loom.  this means a couple of things.  First there would have been no pedals and second at any time the weaver would have been able to walk around the loom and look at the weaving instead of only seeing 4 inches at a time.  3.  Lisse means warp in french in known of my studies have I ever seen reference to the master weaver as Lisse.  Why would anyone say the master weaver was warped.  The master weaver would have been referred to as a "tapessier" or even a "weaver of arras"  and probably in the shop master.  Though the use of this word did give an exotic flare it was an innappropriate use of the word.  4. the tappesier guild was in full bloom and in all likelihood did object to women working, but they weren't the tyrants that are portrayed in the book until well into the 16th century.    I must commend the author in making up a weaver because at that time the artisan seldom took credit for the work.  The credit was taken by the donor or the one that commissioned the work.  So that was an interesting realistic touch.  I worry about the holes because holes like that have a tendency to become "fact" in the minds of those that read the book.  ONce you are aware of the holes you can enjoy the story and not many people study the creation of Gothic Tapestries.  And the Gothic era is considered the high point of tapestry weaving.  Enjoy the story but don't believe the historical aspects of it.  It just doesn't fit in 
 Too complicated to understand. Poor layout of the book. The way information is presented needs to improve a lot 
 On the rear side of the box it clearly says that this DVD includes Spanish and French language in Mono format. It isn't true, doesn't have other language than "3" English tracks! The film is in B&W also. Don't tell me that there isn't technology to translate this in color and make it available in other languages! The film is good anyway 
 This book really wasn't what I thought. It's hard to read as it is outdated (like Mac II days), hardly any examples, a lot of text and not many picture examples. I'm also not sure where the "art" part is  as most examples and explanations aren't very creative and lacks getting to  the point which is what good visual interface design is all about. I became  sketchy reading the book for advice because of this. One of the pictures in  the book even had a large monkey playing on a computer keyboard. I simply  thru the book in the trash because it was big and didn't want to carry it  around. The only thing this book did teach me was what "not" to  do when writing a book 
 this guy writes a nice autobiography about how he did it in marketing... maybe interesting for some but not for me. I guess I was expecting something more than a horn blowing fanfare of an "I did it my way" brag-o-rama 
 This book like most of Diane Stein's publications is filled with half truths and obvious unfounded bias against men. While she does provide some helfpul information her statements following them and Her pontifications that men have caused all the the evil and harm in the world belies her offerings as healings.  She evens demonstates an obvious hostility towards dogs.  What information she does present is so skewed and reworked to justify her intense dislike for a great many entities in the world that it does little to promote any of her socalled nautral healing. Her refusal to recognize that women are part of the humanity and that  men are not less than human is untenable and shameful for someone purporting to teach natural healing.  We are all healers and we all should be both men and women 
 Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an "enriched classic" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so, with this book. They shouldn't call it an "enriched classic". They should call it "dumbed down for lazy readers. 
 The cover of this book jumped out at me - I was expecting more of an analysis of the psychiatric profession and the methods used over the years. Instead, what I got was a long plug for his own method - Choice Theory.   I have worked with chronically "mentally ill" people for over five years now and have seen cases where medication helped people with schizophrenia make a complete turnaround. No, not every person with schizophrenia wants or needs to take medication, but it can help. Mental illness is a very complex problem. While I also don't like the drug-centered nature of the mental health field, I don't think there is ONE RIGHT way to address mental health problems. I resent reading a book and getting the message that the author's way is the only way. Life is not that simple. 
 I have a 2006 Lexus GS300, and this item failed miserably.  The skip function did not work, and the unit randomly changed the tracks on the iPod without any user intervention.  And the mechanism itself made so much noise, that when the music was set at a lower volume, you could hear the cassette mechanism turning over the music.  Top that off, the sound quality provided by the unit was fair at best.  Disaster 
 After reading the reviews a bought the accessory kit. I compared the eyepieces and the barlow with standard inexpensive plossls (orion, knigth owl, gso) and the celestron's optics looked the worst one. I sold the kit after 2 weeks.. 
 I didn't make it the whole way through this densely written and intimidating book, but I was absorbed by one aspect: its portrayal of the human interaction between Marx and Engels.   Karl Marx was a psychologically warped semi-genius who continually begged money and favors from his hardworking and enabling friend Friedrich Engels. Sometimes Marx would agree to write articles or essays that he couldn't produce - he manipulated Engels into ghostwriting, and still collected the pay himself.  I also found it interesting that Engels developed his ideas on the class system while he was in England, observing the human experience in industrialized Manchester, which was at that time economically depressed and in a state of social unrest, with a great disparity between the factory owners and workers.  Marx and Engels wrote each other numerous multi-language letters over the years, and _To the Finland Station_ does a nice job tracing this correspondence. It was interesting to learn that spreading their doctrine into Russia was sort of an incidental afterthought, but  I'm afraid I could not bring myself to sift through the intricacies of the development of socialism/communism.     This is a weighty book, and will not be of interest to every reader 
 I put the multi-clip on my belt and the spring metal bent out of shape. I found another clip from another cellphone which fit but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster broke also. The case is great but the accessories suck. Poorly made with light weight materals. Save your money 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months.  While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture.  For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better 
 While the "facts" in this book are interesting, it is such a difficult read.  How any editor let this book by is beyond me.  You can find out more about our society and the events of this period by visiting a retirement home as compared to reading this book.  Paraphrasing that switches from first to third person and overall rambling makes this a terrible read.  This book reads like a high-school project 
 I'm getting kind of over the same old schtick all the time. WHy is it that Jews always self depricate? God knows, the Christians never do that. They're very proud all the time. Jews seem to come off "silly" and sophomoric. I suppose this compilation is pretty comprehensive as far as artists, but it sure would be nice if someone put an album together that had a little more heart to it 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 At first, I was really hyped to see this movie with the big named stars, especially Ms. Weaver. But when it was over I shouted, "I KNEW IT!" For a hard-core horror movie fan like myself, that's definitely a sign of a bad movie review to come. This movie broke my record of figuring out the plot even before the first minute was through. And the only reason why I sat through the entire movie was because I had my check book to balance, and a few crypto puzzles to complete. The Village reminded me of nothing more than a slap-shod script tossed around for a few days among amature script editors, then rushed into the credulous hands of famous stars. Not only did this movie ruin a few good careers, it also ruined my respect for those who stared in it.   Tip for the day: If someone gives you a free copy of The Village, sell it on an auction site immediately. Trust me, you won't feel guilty getting rid of it as fast as you can. You'll experience more suspense selling it to the highest bidder than having to sit through the entire movie. 
 Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, "Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of "don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring." Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life 
 Its probably alright if you like stuff like this but I dont 
 good thing I kept the original box... after only 2 uses, when I tried to lift up the screen I heard a click & a small part came flying off (I didn't drop it or mishandled it).. one of the parts that holds the screen is cracked & prevents it from opening the screen... I was able to exchanged it at TRU w/ no problem.. 
 Sorry, have saved for my trip to the Far East starting next week 
 This CD came out in 1991, after The Fixx took a three year break.  It has 12 songs and is 52 minutes long.    Everyone has their own musical tastes.  Other people below rave about this CD.  I think it is the worst by the The Fixx.  One reviewer says that the first 5 songs are the greatest songs ever.  I think that 4 of the first 5 songs are the worst The Fixx has ever done.  I feel there are only 4 songs of any value on this CD and they are at the end of the CD.  The Fixx were a very popular and very typical New Wave band of the eighties, with short, catchy songs.  The band went into hibernation for three years, and when they came out in 1991, New Wave was dead.  But, that shouldn't matter, as long as The Fixx made a good CD, but they didn't.  On this CD, The Fixx try to incorporate their sound with other styles.  The first half of this CD is more like the New Wave Pop of the eighties, sounding like something Duran, Duran might do, but not as good.  Other tracks sound like they are trying to copy David Bowie.  Another track sounds like INXS.    The tracks I do like on this album are more along the lines of the traditional Fixx sound (except for Shut It Up, that sounds like the INXS copy).  The other good tracks are:  Yesterday, Today, One Jungle and Make No Plans (which might be one of the Fixx's best songs of all time).    I have nothing against bands experimenting and trying new things.  But, they must have a vision, instead of just trying to copy the successful forma of others.  After this CD, the Fixx died, but then made a comeback in 1998 
 This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie.  
 Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity 
 I bought this book for last minute prep for my exam and I found  out it is nothing like the real exam, It doesn't really give you a feel for the real exam,There are other exam preps material out there that gives you more of a feel for the real exam than this book. 
 The Next Generation is basically a remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical, though different characters and locations are used.  The original was a little overrated in my opinion and this "remake" is quite frankly terrible.  Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several B movie actors.  The only major differences from the original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy theory.  The conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous, I won't explain it, theres no point, watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends.  I would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though, even die hards admit its awful, I only gave it 2 stars because I reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst (yes even worse than this!) 
 This comeback was a big letdown.  I was really exited for Curt's return, and was hoping for some revolutionary music from T4F...Like "the Hurting" or "Songs from the Big Chair"...but instead i was really disappointed, as this disc of songs are quality songs... but they are so much like Beatles songs that I cannot tell if it is an homage/tribute, or just lack of original ideas (or fear of them).    This is a CD that does not compare with their early discs style and originality.  "Everybody Loves a Happy Ending" is like the song "Sowing the Seeds of Love", but more extreme in it's imitation of the Beatles style/sound.    It wasn't a happy ending 
 I've used CAD programs written in the 80's that are better than this.   I'll go back to Drawing Board 1.0 over this thing.  Not user friendly.   I can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing.  JUN 
 Meanwhile a lot of other people written very good books in a very different stile: Suzanne Clothier (Bones would rain from the Sky) Patricia McConnell (The other end of the Leash) Turid Rugaas (Calming Signals)  We have three Irish Setter and we prefer a soft method for our dogs 
 Anil is plastic - if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country, they are hidden.  As someone born & raised in Sri Lanka, I felt the situation could have been explained MORE for the rest of the world.  And SUDDENLY this plastic Anil, who has shown no feelings, no emotion (not even surprise) stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming "YOU are killing us!" - us?  And where does this emotion come from.  No-one is even sure WHY Sailor is dead - was it accidental and meant for another, was he killed by JVP for refusing to go on strike?  Why was a gem-miner killed by the death squads? - nothing was explained.  Even the ending - did Sarath & Gamini just die - was it a dream?  Was it all just a sea bath in the Indian Ocean at Mt. Lavinia?   
 I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.   While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.   He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them. 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 I think Eye of the Needle, at least as the film tells the story, suffers from a common problem I have seen in a lot of "action thrillers":  poor character development.  Why should we care about these characters one way or the other?  Instead we have a modicum of action and violence, a dose of beautiful ocean scenery, and lovemaking.  There was not much complexity or discernment in any of the characters. Donald Sutherland simply looks depressed, as a serious actor might be if he found himself wasting his time making a bad film.  Alfred Hitchcock did a much better film along the same lines with "The 39 Steps". 
 The first few reviews are too harsh,I was given this as a gift so I am not as pissed off at the money. I give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book I expected much from anyway.  The plot also gets way to over the top.  I mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? Hero's invited to the summit by the President! They escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to China! Also hero knew the guy was Chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? Why are all the Chinese Americans bad guys as well?   The novel is way to heavy with anit Chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. See the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. Do not expect much and look for used copy, I paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before I cut him off. 
 I used the James Stewart 5e for the first quarter for calculus.  But I switched schools and this school used the Hughes Hallett book.  Pros:  None  Cons:  There not enough reference pages.    There only a total of 2 pages back and front for the whole calculus book.  This book is used for 3 quarters of calculus and this book ONLY has 2 references.  It would be nice to able look back in reference page to refresh my head from first quarter calculus formula but this book has a short list.  James Stewart is better in the way that it takes an extra step to include lots Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry formulas.    Solution manual only has every other odd.  I bought solution manual without looking at it.  They only have a solutions for problem 1, 5, 9, 13, and etc.  The review problems are the same thing where they only work out every other odd problem.  I was able to return this solution manual.  I am super happy I didn't have waste any more money into this book.  Those two cons make me hate this book.  I would recommend that if you had to buy the book, look to other books for reference pages.  Unless your teacher assigns every other odd, I wouldn't buy the solution manual 
 I ordered this item excited to relive some childhood memories of the game and was very disappointed.  What I was hoping would be a reproduction of the original was instead an ugly, overpriced mousepad! The print quality on the board is a joke. Very blurry and an ugly blue instead of the nice cream color of the original.. And instead of a thin piece of leather-like material like the original, the board is the same thickness of a mousepad with the thick rubber backing and everything. Ok, No big deal, right? Wrong!  Imagine how disappointed I was when I rolled up the board to discover the board and the stones do not fit into the tube! No wonder they ship it outside the tube in the box! The glass stones are much like the original, but very light in color -- this was about the only good thing going for the set so for that I'll give it 1 star.  I sent this item back immediately upon receipt and would encourage anyone else interested in PENTE to find an original set and not buy this joke of a reproduction 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 Unless you like ultra modern home designs, skip this book. The plans are impractical, especially with respect to kitchen layouts. Most of the homes have no vestibules in their entrances, which are a neccessity in colder climates 
 This mag needs a new editor. I haven't seen anything interesting in Better Homes for six months. Maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests 
 I hated this book and here is why :  1.) Way too verbose (like a literature novel) for an action novel.   2.) Too much boring character development (to the point of being a distraction to the plot) 3.) Very slow.  The plot took forever to develop.  There was no suspense in the middle of the book. 4.) Terrible ending (the worst ending I could have imagined for this plot)  The only good thing I can say about this book 1.) I read it on the plane, so I really didn't "waste" my time per say, since I had to kill the time anyway 
 The only good thing about this movie was my wife going into labor 2 hours later.  We must have fast forwarded 1/2 the movie, and it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  My wife enjoyed labor more than I enjoyed enduring the movie.  Be careful if it's not close to your due date . . . 
 I was very disappointed with this book.The title and theme really grabbed me. What you will read are the ramblings of several peoples current life stories that are boring and unhelpful. It is like Po searched out a bunch of aimless people doing strange things.The bookis no help for a typical middle class person or a blue collar worker trying to get a foot in a new door. I am tired of publishers publishing books that never arrive at any point or recommended solution. Like the readers are just blessed to be reading stlye, good English, and punctuation. Where are the solutions?Or at least be thought provoking.This book was neither 
 Ripping off King, but with more sex, shallower characters, and a Hollywood ending. Leave it on the shelf 
 I rented this game for my 3 year old.  Who loves the movie.  He tried to play it.  He like it.  I tried to play it & got to the dancing part.  I couldn't get past it.  I tried for 5 days.  My rental time was up.  I returned it.  I haven't rented it since.  This game is way too hard to beat.  And my 3 year old got bored with it real fast.  I would NOT recommend this game to anyone.  Don't waste your money buying it.  Unless you are an expert with video games.  I'm just thankful that I rented it instead of buying it 
 As a software developer I found most of the information in this book to be something less than earth shattering.  Basically, there are companies that specialize in data mining as much information on us as they can.  The present administration is drooling over the possibility to use this information.  A large percentage of the information stored in the databases is in error.  That's pretty much the book.  Should we be concerned?  Yes, but not of the information existing because its mostly public information anyway that is being linked in creativie ways.  I'm not an advocate for this by any means but I'm not terribly fearful of it either.  What does concern me, and should you, is how much of the information is wrong and how difficult it is to get these companies to fix it.  To me, that was the greatest point the book made.  As for government spying.  We know now that the government is surveying us in much greater and more Orwellian ways than we would have thought possible.  Unfortunately, this is what I wanted to learn more about and is pretty much missing from the book.  Also, there is no "solution" provided.  How can we protect ourselves?    Mainly, I was disapointed be because every person mentioned in the book has a drawn out biography provided about them.  I really didn't care how the CEO of a data mining company grew up.  I wanted to learn about the subject of the book, not history of indivuals.  Its not a bad book, but I grew tired of the biographies and the content didn't surprise me or frighten me enough to be real impressed 
 There are certainly some memorable scenes in this film, but as a whole it just didn't quite work for me.    Vlastimil Brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character: Fanda, a maddening yet adorable grandpa, oh-so-young-at-heart, oh-so-mischievious and impish, but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and harmless that you can't help loving him warts and all.  In fact, that's one of the fatal flaws of this movie: the lack of any dark side to any of the characters.  They're all basically harmless Walt Disney types, even the bumbling and self-absorbed son.  There are no real consequences to Brodsky's actions other than Stella (his wife) finally talking divorce but it's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she'll come back to him.  There is no center, no force or dynamic power in this film---it's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you don't want to hurt the feelings of your host.    The ending also relies on another lazy device, the virtual deux ex machina in the person of Stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice/supporter of Fanda's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only making him miserable.  This film might've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with Fanda's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death, instead of focusing on how clever, audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is, which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse, narcissism.  One wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with Mr. Brodsky, who is a towering figure among Czech actors, that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him.    A more accurate title for this movie, especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll, might be: "The Fantasy Life of a Poor Old Man."  
 If a story doesn't hook by the middle of Chapter 3, there are other books to open, books that kick in by PAGE 3, thank heaven. I bought TIME BOMB because the reviews on the jacket made it look fast and thrilling. I could not even finish chapter 3. I'd read something once by Jonathan Kellerman that made me remember him as a reliable author of great escapist fiction. I can't remember what it was.  *sigh* I don't see where these rave reviews are coming from. The book is so boring.  Also, the racist meanies I saw lurching up over the horizon, as well as being hackneyed and ho-hum, were unrealistic. Even the meanest harshest republican white adult male doesn't picket a school in a high income neighborhood shouting "wetback" and "greaser". Not even in wacky California, I shouldn't think. 
 An awful yawner.  It shows all the reasons chivalry made for tiresome tales, and why the world needed Don Quixote so badly.  The Chretien de Troyes version of Lancelot is repetitious, has many loose ends, and is full of plot holes.  Lancelot jumps into a cart to shame himself in pursuit of Guenivere.  Before Lancelot jumps into the cart, the narrator states that "reason is the enemy of love."  In the scope of the book, and the code of chivalry, reason is the enemy of this genre.  Take with Nyquil. 
 this product did not dry my hair as described on the box.  It did straighten my hair, but that was all.  I had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this T3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it.  
 This is a terrible movie. When it came out in 1956 it was a box office bomb even though both stars were at the height of their powers. Time had only added to it's mediocrity 
 Since you can tell how I feel about this book based on the title of my review, I won't repeat everything that's been said by the other reviewers so far.  However, I will say that, as a small business owner who tries very hard to spend money wisely, I am SO NOT HAPPY that I spent close to $20 for this book that is of absolutely no value to me.  I don't want to throw it away, but I certainly can't see where anybody would want to buy it if I re-sold it. This book was a total waste of money--if there were a 0-star rating, I'd give it that without hesitation 
 All I wanted to do was learn html code in a short peroid of time.  I did not have any prior knowlege so I was looking for a beginner book.  This book is terrible.  Half the chapters don't even deal with html at all.  There is an entire chapter on the different colors that you should use in your site.  It is as if the author is trying to give you an art class.  If you want to learn html code and have no prior knowlege, I recommend HTML 4 Visual Quickstart Quide by Elizabeth Castro 
 This is completely UNAUTHORIZED by the band, meaning there are no interviews with the band, and no music by the band on the DVD.  Features the same 5 band photos over and over, no live clips, and interviews are okay, none with the band.  If you really want a biography on MCR, get "Life on the Murder Scene".  A little more expensive, but has 2 DVD's and a live CD, tons of music by MCR, and interviews with MCR.  This DVD has audio a couple of recordings of the video interviews on "Life on the Murder Scene".  Trivia was okay.  I would not have bought if I would have known how bad it was 
 The song that ends the movie or is "Send Me On My Way" by Rusted Root. THAT is worth getting. Does anyone know what the other songs with singing are 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 Interesting to see a book like this come from Prestowitz, former Undersecretary in the Reagan Administration.   Back then it was America losing its good jobs and future to the Japanese.  Remember them?  Japan, Inc....central planning...national industrial policy...would soon be running the world.  American debt, loss of technological edge, outsourcing would all mean the USA would be reduced to second-world status by 2006.  It was precisely because Prestowitz's Commerce Department let the 'hidden hand' of the market prevail that we wound up with the economic boom of the 90s.  So it is very strange to see Prestowitz ring the same alarm bells he firmly rejected a generation ago.  Seems every economic book I read these days remeinds me of the early 80s....alarmist.  That is not to deny the issues he raises in this book, but to paint a grim and destitute future for the American economy is tired and not well thought out.  That, in the end, is why this book only gets two stars.  Intellectually it's bereft.  Nothing new here 
 Achebe was correct when he described this book as a sick book. It is. Just disgusting and trying to hard to be sophisticated, ie, "European". The description by Achebe that Armah's book reminds him of the Jean Paul Sartre novel where two characters sit around looking bored in a cafe in Paris and then in a burst of nihilistic energy decide to stab themselves to make some obscure point to each other. He's on the money. Unfortunately Armah came on the scene when publishing in Africa was not more discriminating 
 I've been robbed.  I just spent $25 for this hard cover book, and now that I finished it - I feel like burning it! I feel like the authors have jerked me around, led me along so I spent my hard earned money on their three goldarned books - and for what?  Let me explain. When you start an alternative history book on any  era, you begin with a question.  "What would have happened if something had gone differently"  . Here the authors are free to pick from the hundreds of critical events and make a point of departure.  The authors choose a very interesting one. What if Lee have listened to Longstreets advice and made a massive flanking movement to the South at Gettysburg.  The first book of this trilogy covered these fictional events with not only a truely outstanding depth of knowlege of the era, but a breathtaking mastery of suspence and pacing. This was an adventure novel of the first water. A real page-turner with such detail that you felt you were present at actual events depicted in the book. Staying well within the bounds of the possible, it was utterly convincing - even to the knowledgeable reader.  The second novel was not quite as good as the first but it still had fire and held our interest well.  The end of the second novel left the Confederacy in possession of Baltimore - America's third largest city - with a large population (which about half were sympathitic to the Southern cause)and loaded with heavy industry and the technical craftsmen that the South so desperately needed. There was a major diplomatic initutive that won the French over to extending recognition to the Confederacy - there is even some exposition on the French Emperor deciding to dispatch not only troops but state-of-the-art sea going iron clad warships from the French Navy to aid the Confederates (and secure a firmer foot hold in Mexico, naturalmont).  There was an extensive dialogue with a leading Jewish intelectual in Baltimore where some broad hints were dropped about possible last ditch efforts to arm some of the Souths blacks to refil the depleated Confederate ranks.  The second novel ends August 22, 1963. We are left with all these interesting possibilities. All these interesting avenues for the alternate history author to explore.  I bought the third novel and rushed home to read it. As I turned the pages a growing sense of dread filled me - the authors were rushing things, closing off Confederate hopes with such obvious heavy handed partiallity.   You always see this near the end of a cheap potboiler - the bad guys, who have previously been masterful and clever, quite suddenly become increadibly stupid and make mistake after mistake, while the good guys, who have struggled all the way through the book to put two and two together, are suddenly geniuses and have ever possible break falls their way.  So it was with this book. You have a stupid and drunken Southerner assigned to oversee the vitally stategic B&O railroad main yard. The crafty (and openly partison to the North) yard superintendant not only delays critical Southen supplies and troop movements, he orchestrates a major campaign of sabotage and even sends one of his men to inform the Union forces of these  critical Confederate plans - all without getting caught or even suspected by those dim wit southerners.  You could tell it was all a set up from there, the sense of credibility is gone. Everything and I mean everything goes wrong for those darn rebels. Once the authors partisonship is out in the open, it is clear that history will be repeating itself here.  The third book ends with the South's ignoble defeat- now note this carefully - Lee surrenders on August 30, 1863.   THIS IS ONLY EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND NOVEL ! You get what I mean by the authors rushing things. And that, friends, is not only straining credibility, it throws it to the winds.   To use one typical example - the Noble Army of the Potomic which after its smashing defeat at Gettysburg took a full month to recover, somehow after an even more devistating defeat is able to rest, reorganize, resupply and move into position to attack Baltimore with 15,000 troops - after just 9 days - yea, right.   The pathetic Confederates, somehow have not managed to make any improvements to Baltimore's existing fortificatins, can not seem to even delay a daylight amphibious landing, nor do they fight house to house nor deploy mobile artillery to delay the advance. On the other hand, the dashing Union calvalry, storms into Frederick, and in 3 hours whips up a bomb train to take out a stone bridge, while the stupid Confederates, who have been in full possession of Baltamore for a month, can not round up enough gunpowder to blow up a similar bridge. Thus Baltimore not only falls with hardly a shot, the entire infrastructure is intact!!??!!. Wow, what a break for the good guys ;-)   This third book is a not just a total disapointment - it is a rip-off. Having raised all these interesting ideas and giving the South two absolutely smashing (if hard faught) victories - the authors whip out the climax - the totally collapse of the Southern armies like a cheap tent in just one week.  In case anyone has forgotten, even without those smashing victories and the possession of the critical city of Baltimore, the South managed to fight on - dispite General Grants best efforts until 1865 !  This book was a cruel disappointment. There was no follow up of all the interesting ideas raised in the second book. It seems like the authors lost interest and just slapped together a jury rigged ending to please the house.  Yep - the good guys won, (yawn).  One had hoped for more courage and intelectual honesty from the authors 
 While the book contains tried-and-true tactics that will always work, it is outdated and not thorough enough.  No mention, for example, on dropshot, splitshot, or swimbait techniques.  Very brief mention of casting techniques, and nothing about pitching.  All of the B&W photos look like the fishermen were going to a screening of "Saturday Night Fever" once they got off the lake.  The book was "updated" by Mark Hicks, who never hesitates to include photos and stories of himself, a no-no in the unwritten rules of authors.  I should have spent my money on Roland Martin's or Van Dam's books.  
 Mike Davis, in an interview, admitted that he does not let the facts stand in the way of his arguments. City of Quartz demonstrates this tendency to the fullest. In a previous work, Davis pulled a passage out of a work of fiction and cited it as fact. He shows similar inventiveness in this work, citing studies that were never conducted, inventing interviews, and displaying a creativity with statistics that would be admirable if it weren't for the frightening fact that many who have read this work found it "incisive."   Those who applaud this work do so because it supports their politics. Those who attack it do so because it does not. I tried to remain neutral while reading, but when I read the book I found the inaccuracies to completely outweigh any points made by Davis. His purposeful and methodical deception does more harm than good to his cause.   For more information on this work, see an article at: (...) I would steer clear of Mike Davis and his blatant distortions of the truth 
 The package the book came in was smashed. The book appeared as if it had been used. It took over 2 weeks for it to arrive. I wouldn't order any books from amazon agai 
 I'm thankful that I was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15.00 buying it.  I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away.  He should have stopped with that book. It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way.  The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures.  It did have one thought that I really liked:  "Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge.  If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly?&quot 
 Not that the author has not been scholastically thorough in his presentation of what he deems "facts", but there is with this book more than meets the eye.  As a Philadelphian and as a member of The Nation of Islam, I know and grew up observing many of Mr. Griffin's principal subjects and, quite frankly, it isn't as simple as he makes it seem.    Yes, there was corruption and crime in Black Philadelphia in the 1970's, and some of it was clearly the work of those who dubiously identified themselves as Nation members.  However, to use the terms "Black Muslims" (Nation of Islam) and "Black Mafia" interchangably would be a gross error for too many reasons to cite in this space.  Suffice it to say that some of the men that Mr. Griffin would paint with the broad brush of suspicion have been either penitant for their crimes, vindicated by the legacy of their extraordinary children, or both...  In short, this treatise and its oddly coincidental release date (concurrent with the widely reported trial of a Muslim cleric in Philadelphia) could also stand to come under some "investigation". Wise readers will take all of the above and more into account when reading this, all the while remembering that the "Black Mafia" is no more, but the glorious history of Islam in Black Philadelphia continues to flourish today, in spite of the best efforts of its detractors 
 I have all of Nicholas Sparks novels, and I can honestly say that this one left much to be desired.  I have also raved about Nicholas Sparks' works to everyone; however, I don't have much to rave about this time.  The book was too predictable; although I have often figured out other story lines written by Sparks, but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had.  I am disappointed in the book and hope to see that Nicholas Sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines.  Hopefully he can find time (outside of coaching track) to write another wonderful novel such as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding, and the list goes on (but stops at Dear John) 
 This is not a good book. If you are a fan of the current "Dark Age of Comics" and revisionist history it may be your cup of tea, but not mine. Yes, it has some decent drawings, but has a cookie cuter style standard with the publisher DK. It favors heavily the current group over past superior line-ups touching only lightly on the Bronze Age Maxwell Lord and Martian Manhunter led inner city groups. It fails to value the fondly regarded Super Friends. The whole thing appears like an ad for the present Justice League. If you are looking for a more fair and balanced overview I suggest petitioning Les Daniels of "The Complete (Superman, Batman Wonder Woman) series to do a Complete Justice League of America. This volume and others in the DC Ultimate series try, but do not hit the mark. They are worth buying, but not at this price. And with a little effort could be improved upon 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read.  You go from story to story hoping that the next one will be engaging or interesting, but it never happens.  Each of the stories in this book could have just have easily come from a 15 year old writing English assignments who also happens to have a bizarre fascination with bowel movements and bodily functions in general.  In summary, truly awful.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  Keep looking 
 If you like shallow arguements and can't think yourself out of a paper bag, this is a must read.  Bill use hate speach that will awe the stupid and make the intelligent cry out in frustration.  Remember unlike the government, Bill knows what is best for us....mainly buying his cheap products and buying these third grade readers 
 Note that the paperback version is the student study companion to the hardback book, not a paperback version of the original text 
 Sorry, but I actually hate that this record is so perfect.  Perfect performances.  Perfect sounds.  Perfect engineering.  Perfect everything.  Over-produced makes it synthetic and stale.  Surf needs a little character in my opinion.  Bottom line is that it's perfectly boring 
 I teach a computing ethics course at an area University.  I did not select this book as my text when I reviewed texts for use in the Fall 2004 semester.  I did choose Spinello and Tavani's new reader; but this book--like most of the predecessors Spinello has written--would drive my students nuts -- and they wouldn't know why. Bottom line: poorly written and not easy to read -- lots of tough sentence choices made.  However, as with Spinello's other books, there are some points he makes that no other computing ethics texts' authors do make!  So, I'll glean those points out of his text and present them to my students rather than force them to work their way through and around his prose 
 This is a feel good book attempting to make an argument that people in business can be "professionals." By definition, business people exist to create and manage a business entity inorder to generate a profit. Professionals are licensed individuals. They are mandated by law is to protect the public's health, safety and welfare through the services that they provide to the community. This book is an attempt to corrupt and diminish the definition of professionalism.  
 All sizzle and no steak.  I am a fan of Senge's initial work.  This one falls short of making a mark.  Maybe I expected too much.  In any regard, I felt suckered after getting half-way thru this thing and I quit. Hope you have a different experience 
 We were looking for scientific, comprehensive information about fertility and conception.  We found this book to be vague and general, which is OK if you need some background on general infertility or fertility issues.  If you want a much more specific "how-to" on identifying fertile days, knowledge of fertility signs, and how to make detailed charts that will be useful for you and your doctor, then we very strongly recommend Toni Weschler's "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" instead.  
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 The book was somewhat well-written, and parts were certainly enjoyable, but there is nothing that you can find here that you cannot find in greater detail and with more useful information somewhere else. The case notes were frequently short enough that you would have no real interest in the case, and it read more like a How-To book for someone interested in writing a medico-legal thriller, as long as the person writing that just wanted a lot of really general information without actually knowing enough of what they are talking about. If you really want a good general interest forensics book, check out What The Corpse Revealed by Hugh Miller. In short, the book had a lot of information in it, but none of it was unavailable or more useful here than other sources 
 Back in 1966, when no one had done anything like this it was probably hysterical!  But any one episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, no matter which one, is at least three times as funny as this.  At least in my opinion.  This movie has a few funny moments, but I am glad I saw this as a rental and not a purchase 
 There's some useful information but it's extremely difficult to find through all the pointless little quizzes and stories about how awesome the author is at reading people 
 The awfully titled "Food of Love" was Catalonian director's Ventura Pons first English-language film, adapted from a not very good book ("The Page Turner") by American David Leavitt.  The result, I regret to say, was Pons' worst film to date.    The story concerns an 18-year-old aspiring gay pianist, his recently-separated mother and an older pianist with whom he has his first gay sexual relationship during his summer vacation in Barcelona (with his mother).  However, this is not a "coming out" film; all the problems are generated by the mother's feeling due to her divorce and, especially, the intergenerational conflicts between the two leading men.  (Sex is fairly tame too, and the nudity consists of shots of the young man from behind.)  Unfortunately, the movie is poorly scripted (the lines of dialogue are quite laughable at crucial moments) and, worst of all, badly acted.  Kevin Bishop, who plays Paul, the young man at the center of the story, gives a really terrible performance.  He is cute, though (the blonde, blue-eyed boy type), which may explain why he gets compliments in other reviews and even by David Leavitt (in the interview he gives on the DVD).  I'm sure if he were ugly everyone would comment right away on his bad performance. Paul is not a very likable (save physically) or believable character, either. (He also doesnt seem to be having much fun in his sexual relationships and he really mistreats his mother... and she lets him get away with it.)  The other male leads give bad performances as well, with zero nuances or depth.  To be fair, their dialogue is pretty bad to begin with.   The film's only saving grace is the great Juliet Stevenson, who is truly wasted in the poorly written (and cliched) role of the mother who is clueless about her sons (and his lovers) sexual orientation.  Still, Stevenson is such a talented(and funny) actress that she manages to make you care about the character by the end.    I recommend you skip this and rent any other of Ventura Pons' films.  He's an interesting director (hence I checked out this movie) but this film was a misfire from beginning to end.  
 This book completely fails to realistically convey the relative risks and profit potential for the average wannabe day trader.  Im talking about someone with less than a few thousand to play the market.  Unless you have big bucks and Level II quotes forget day trading unless you are very lucky. In the trading parlance, I wish I had a short position on this book at its current price, and could cover my short at the current used price! Save your money 
 Hey, that just goes without being said. All of their live albums suck because they suck. Go Creed! I can't wait for Scott Stapp's solo album! Awesome, baby 
 I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud 
 Do not expect much of an wisdom here. The book has enough material for maybe a one page pamphlet. The rest is war stories without beginnings or endings. It also would have been better to leave the reading to native speakers only 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 While the sweeper does do an excellent job of sweeping up everything on the kitchen floor, the next time you use it it dumps most of the debris back on the floor.  I have tried emptying the containers, rolling and using the comb to clean the bottom. No luck.  It still dumps dirt on the floor at the beginning of each use.  You then have to sweep over the pile several times to get it picked up again.  The handle also has come apart but that I can live with.  The base of the unit is a large square and even though I have a large floor it would be more useful if it was smaller and more rectangular.  If you have a small kitchen floor that is not an open rectangle for cleaning the size  may be a problem.  I should probably have sent it back since it is more work to clean with it.  But I keep hoping I can figure out why it is dumping debris.  If I could get it to stop doing it it would be useful 
 For those who have never lived in, been to, or heard of California, or indeed have never reflected momentarily on the relation between media images and public opinion, this book might offer something like fresh insights; for everyone else, this warmed-over dissertation is little more than a neat summary of cliches, inaccuracies, and other's ideas.  The scholarship is alternately myopic, specious, and unoriginal (though occasionally it is all three at once!) and the writing itself either cringe-worthy or just plain bland (it reads much like the plagiarized book report of an accomplished high school student).  There are a few sites out there already which document the absurdities of this book better than I could here, so I won't waste my/your time.  I'm not sure what I can say in defense of the book or those who have endorsed it above (one of whom I suspect of being a relative); but to the latter I can offer a suggestion:  check out either Mike Davis or Kevin Starr to see how derivative this book is (also see Steven Gaines and Timothy White's respective books on the Beach Boys).  And to the prospective buyer: don't bother with this hackneyed term paper, buy _City of Quartz_ and listen to "Pet Sounds" instead 
 The previous reviews are quite accurate, and should be read before deciding to purchase. For my part, I was overall content with the book, since I was more interested in the ship statistics and some of the "historical" descriptions than the artwork, so the admittedly disappointing nature of the ship renderings did not put me off as badly. However, the omission of key ships (see below) was a major disappointment, particularly galling was the insistence on describing things I could care less about, such as the Midas Array, "worker bees", etc. If one is going to limit oneself to 128 pages and 30 ships, then perhaps a little more common sense ought to have been devoted to selecting which "ships" to describe!  Another problem I had with some of the more exotic alien ships was a lack of information on their statistics, especially the Species 8472 bioship. While one cannot reveal all secrets, having everything listed as "unknown" is more than a little unsatisfying. At the least simply state observed qualities (i.e. maximum warp (observed) 9.46) or something similar.  I also agree that the line drawings of the ships were not as useful as they could have been. I would suggest either replacing or perhaps augmenting them with more standard 3 view drawings (front, profile, and top) as are given in the Star Fleet Technical Manual, for example.  It is my sincerest hope that a revised and heavily expanded 2nd edition will be released. Should the author(s) read this, here are some glaring omissions in need of being added: - Excelsior class - Ambassador class - Constellation class - Oberth class - Daedalus class - Borg cube - Borg sphere - Borg tactical cube - Enterprise NX-01 - Klingon Negh'Var battleship - K'Vort class cruiser  Very nice and much appreciated additions would be: - Vulcan ships from Enterprise - Klingon ships from Enterprise (a number of new designs are in evidence) - The Romulan ship from Enterprise (the minefield episode) - Other Earth ships from Enterprise (particularly the 2nd season finale) - "Kobyashi Maru" Neutronic Fuel carrier - Freighter destroyed in STIII by Bird of Prey - Tholian ships - Kazon ship  In spite of the unflattering reviews, this is a neat little book. For the price (on Amazon, that is), it is not a terribly bad buy. Wouldn't pay any more for it, though! However, there is much room for improvement, and I fervently hope the authors will take it upon themselves to release a vastly enhanced manual in the near future. 
 Some interesting lists mixed in with a lot of either fanboy or totally confusing lists of top fighters, etc. with little actual merit makes this a very hard book to get into 
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 This book champions the case of plural identities & builds on many examples from different histories to highlight how any other way of socio-politico-cultural categorization is or has been misleading.    That & that alone, is the primary message of the book. It is disappointing to read Sen stressing this one basic idea over & over again in different contexts & with different examples throughout this book. Sure, there are ramifications of this one basic idea but they're, at best, common-sensical & Sen does not have any new insight or theory that he builds on.   The text is dry & the style archaic. As in his other books, history has been used selectively to highlight a point, never mind if that event was of any political or social consequence.   If you've read other books by Sen, or you're the kind who takes an interest in socio-economic & political matters, you'll find that this book does little to either sharpen your insight into aspects of our world or indeed build a new school of social analysis.   This book is intellectually sterile.   S! 
 This self-indulged book by one of pro wrestling''s notorious heavy-hitters and egomaniacs from recent pro wrestling history, is a huge disappointment.  For one thing, his legendary BIG and LOUD style doesn't transliterate well to the printed page --Watts is sitll obnoxious, too BIG and too LOUD; for another, his recollection of wrestling history during the late '60s to '70s and '80s is too self-interested and too self-serving, especially without documentation; third, if Watts were the clever guy he regards himself to be, why would he now be hard-selling an image of himself (that is so inconsistent with what we all know him to be) and yet another health-care product (not vitamins this time, but JESUS) if he didn't already know as much as he thinks he knows about his audience -- we're still all MARKS!  But for readers interested in pro wrestling history during this time frame, Watts' self-interested account should at least be received as another view alongside others.  Having studied many of these wrestling books in recent years, I still think that Wilson and Johnson's CHOKEHOLD is the Bible when it comes to describing (and documenting) pro wrestling history.  
 We couldn't find ANY of the collectibles on which we needed information - and the index was the WORST I've ever seen!  I felt totally ripped off with this book but it would cost more to return than it was worth.  Maybe I can find an antique outhouse and supply it with a fresh 2007 price guide... 
 Perhaps reading this book from the vantage point of 2006 is a mistake, but I thought I'd enjoy Drucker's big picture thinking about the topic of the knowledge economy.  Drucker's discussion of the rise of the knowledge worker in today's society was only a quarter of this book.  This book is really a series of essays that lacked coherence as a whole.  I would recommend "The Essential Drucker" instead, to the reader looking for a good compilation of Drucker's insights.  
 This is one of those catch-all biographies that attempts to throw in everything including the kitchen sink and fails in all regards.  The author, D. J. Taylor attempts to connect Orwell's writings with his life but spends so much time on trying to find little kernels of truth in the authors mundane diary entries that he accomplishes almost nothing.  Since Taylor has no ability to write critically about Orwell's works he should have focused on the details of Orwell's life which are easier to record.  Also one gets the feeling that Taylor isn't a fan of Orwell's writing and has little simpathy for his weaknesses in character. So why write the book 
 The Body Project provides very selective leeway into the societal effects of African-American adolescent girls and their personal body projects. The main focus of this book is on the evolution of the white middle-class adolescent girl throughout American history. African-American and Jewish girls are mentioned briefly in a few chapters, while other ethnic groups are simply never discussed. Are these other various ethnic groups not worthy of their equal place in Brumberg's book? Brumberg focuses on the evolution of the white middle-class female adolescent starting in the early 1800s and ending in the late 1990s. An evolution of the African American adolescent also took place during these times, but differently than that of their white female counterparts.  In order to understand black American adolescents today, foundation for cultural practices must first be established. Brumberg never mentions the coexistence of enslaved blacks, in America during the 18th or 19th centuries. Though all women have the same biological anatomy, our genes vary, our cultures vary, so we should dispel the idea that when certain groups of women who menstruate earlier than others are abnormal or inferior. Brumberg reveals that this type of thought was well circulated throughout the medical community remained true during the Victorian period. The notion that black health was considered an expendable asset in the American medical community well through the early 1970s.  One major issue that Brumberg avoids is the abuse of children and adolescents. There is probably a close connection between the body projects that adolescents undertake and their harsh self-image.  Brumberg fails to expand on the greater idea that people exist who can never truly choose their identity before it first chooses them. Many girls are intrinsically bound to a stereotype, despite self-image. Possibly everyone has small things that they would like to alter about their physical appearances; however Americans also fail to see these "body projects" as a form a western female mutilation, of which millions of women have fallen victim. Plastic surgery is an ever-growing project that young girls obsess about. This standard idea of beauty that girls manipulate themselves on must disappear, before our individuality as women disappears.  
 "You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing" is what he said. Hiroshima Mon Amour depicts the reality of the bombing of Hiroshima, which took place on August 6, 1945.  The story begins with two bodies against each other with multiple clips of the results of the bombing.  When I watched this movie for the first time, I realized this movie was far from a fairy tale.  Instead, this movie captured reality and could be described as the "fiction" aspect of history William Gass explains in "The Nature of Narrative".  Throughout the entire movie the main character, a woman from France explains the hardships she went through back at home.  It was disturbing for me to watch the movie as it went back in time where she was taunted for have been in love with a German soldier.  I felt it violated a person's right as to whom he/she may date.  It was also unbearable to watch the clips where it shows the end results after the bombing of Hiroshima.  The fact that this movie was made in 1959 the black and white picture made it difficult for me to read the subtitles.  Lastly, the one thing I must question about this movie is the fact that it was told in French.  I couldn't help but get frustrated that the movie started from an awkward stage of the overall story.  It seems as though it skipped the introduction and went straight into the rising of the climax.  I didn't like that they both speak of the war with no clear explanation as to what they're really talking about.  If a person who was completely oblivious about the history of Hiroshima were to watch this movie, he/she that's watching would have a hard time comprehending the overall point of the movie.  
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 The story is entertaining enough, but there is not much joy from viewing this DVD. The problem is that the folks producing it apparently were trying to win the contest for the DVD having the world's squattest image. It is EXTREMELY letterboxed WITHIN a 16:9 widescreen format. Even your zoom function won't help you, because the producers moved the subtitles into the black-bar region (and the subtitles are about 2/3 the height of the image itself. The movie becomes simply uninvolving when you see low-resolution images on a thin ribbon across the screen 
 Not worth the money. The ads on TV and on the web are compelling, but ultimately deceptive. These DVDs each contain a few events that drag on for ever. Unlike the ads which suggest that you'll see a great variety of events and people, the actual DVDs contain the same few girls repeatedly doing the same thing. Very disappointing 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 I could not get through this book.  It was boring and slow moving.  Smilla is a smug, cold  and rather perverse woman who could not hold my interest 
 In a word this movie was disappointing. It's supposed to be about beautiful Spaniards having sex on a magnificent Mediterranean island. Well there wasn't that much sex and the photography was nothing special. Add that to a plodding pace and poor plot and you don't get a very good fil 
 Poor singers, annoying sound effects in what some people call songs. Their voices are just auful at times, like a sqeaky old granma. God I hate this album 
 This book was a very interesting way of looking at relationships.  I had a hard time reading the entire book because about half way through, it suggested that I change who I am to be more like the guy I wanted to fall in love with me.  I am just not willing to change myself that much, so I don't think that I was a very good candidate for the book.  I had a difficult time believing that it is morally correct to make someone fall in love with you when you are not acting completely like yourself.  After reading this book you may spend more time focusing on all of its rules then actually getting to know the guy.  I do think that it is an interesting read but try not to hang on its every word 
 I have used a lightweight Hoover for years and was very pleased with it.  When I first received this new cleaner I was really excited with the power it had.  The third time I used it the belt broke.  With each use, my back would start hurting. The forward motion was very easy, but pulling it back was hard.  I returned this product because I felt there was something wrong with it 
 i loved the ideas presented in this book, and i do read alot of books about the media, modern technologies, and their effect on our lives and on the society.  although the presented ideas are great, the style of the writing gets to me every time.  absolutely terrible.  im not sure if the author was trying to exemplify the mass confusions, lack of attention span of today's society through the litteral writing, but it detracts from the points that he makes.  many examples are presented have no form of organization whatsoever, and many arent even necessary.  zengotita could have conveyed the message of the book in half the length and it would have been more effective than this book will ever be 
 I enjoyed Dick's short stories and was expecting the same quality from those in this book, i.e. an engaging plot and interesting characters. Scenes play out tediously with characters and their mind chatter ceaselessly flowing (to a point where it becomes annoying) with bits and pieces of information and occasional dialogue that tries to move whatever plot there is along. There were numerous characters none of which were very interesting or that one could attach affection to. It got to a point three quarters of the way in that I said to myself "Who really cares what happens?" It's really a person's preference whether this type of fiction is page turning or not, as some have said, for me it was not. This was hard labor to get through and it's books like these that make me wonder whether reading a novel is worthwhile, because I for one dislike wasting time with nonsense. Fortunately it's a forgettable piece that I'll probably have no recollection of reading a year from now, thank goodness for that.  From now on I'll be more careful with what I buy that's written by Philip K. Dick. 
 There is nothing I can add here that most of the other reviewers have not already stated.  I bought this book off the discount shelf, on a whim for the title and description - ironically, for Tosches explains exactly such buyer whims in the letter he wrote to his publisher in the long middle chapter of the book.  If not for the huge sign proclaiming "Hardcover Bestsellers for $7.99" (who can resist browsing for a hardcover at that price?), I might have continued a blissful ignorance of Nick Tosches altogether.  I learned long ago, however, that serious readers are often explorers in the spirit of Columbus, always searching for new horizons and occasionally colliding with the unknown.  As unintentionally or unthinkingly as the collisions occur, they nonetheless influence the paths of our lives.  So it is with my first encounter with Nick Tosches and "In the Hand of Dante."  Though engaged variously by some of the characters; the intellectual discourse on Catholicism and papacy; and an honest baring of the soul that reveals how difficult it is indeed to create - this book was a maddening reading experience.  An original idea that could have been crafted into a satisfying story, Tosches instead vomits a gush of chapters that present a barely cohesive narrative.  Yeah, Nick is a smart guy.  Yet for all the cleverness and complexity he tries to weave into this story, pedantic prose and self-indulgence seem more the work of an average college freshman writing a theme paper than that of an acclaimed author.  I give it two stars because I liked Lou, the hitman, and for the fact that it wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it.  Still, Tosches intrigues me enough that I'd like to read another of his books.  Don't let me down, Nick 
 I'm thankful Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is available in digital format, given all the years it's been stalled out available only in VHS format.  But geez, what a hokey way of making it available.  As another reviewer points out, the Amazon "Unbox" video player required to access the movie on the PC demands that it be able to scan your system for whatever, and it likes to take it's own sweet time to be able to do it.  Just what we all want, another service dominating our system resources for it's own exclusive purposes.  If you're running with portable devices, add Amazon "Unbox" to the list of services that want to get sync'd up to your device.  And, unfortunately, despite the sys-requirements indicating compatibility with Windows Media Center, my hopes that the XBox 360 could access the video through the Media Connect back end did not pan out (despite the XBox 360 recognizing the video, it was locked out by Amazon's protection of the video).  Despite all this exclusive lock down of the content, they do make it possible to obtain one copy on your portable device.  So, I did the download (took a day!) got it running with Amazon Unbox on the PC, and sync'd up with a Zen Vision M, and then uninstalled all the Amazon Unbox stuff and now am able to only play it on the Vision M (and connected video devices).  Not optimal, but a somewhat improved over VHS copy playable until a high-def release comes out and we hopefully get sorted out on all the DRM quandry 
 This book is poorly written.  The middle east has been explored by many writers, and there are many views about peace and war in that area and elsewhere.  This book is simply not a good vehicle for exploring these complex issues, and it brings the reader no enlightenment about the deep issues it purports to explain 
 This product seems to only design to last max 1 year as it will start to leak like crazy.  Luckily in Australia they offer 2 year warranty so I got it replaced. But I will not go back to this system, turn to the jug one instead 
 The locket on this cable chain is so tiny, you will not be able to put a picture in it.  After opening the box and being completely disappointed, I opened the locket to see how it worked.  It would not close properly after opening.  The quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money.  
 This movie is my favorite movie. Ever. I feel terrible giving it two stars. But it gets 2 stars because I am comparing it to the Rhino version, which I also own. I also own the original VHS. I have watched this movie at least once a year since I was 8 except for about 6 years in middle school/HS. I can sit in class and watch it from memory in my head.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION.  If you can't find the Rhino version, this isn't half bad. Its just that that version is much better, and since I have been growing up with older copies, the new one's flaws, minor to the newcomer, are blinding to me. I also am physically unable to watch any of the "Special Edition" Star Wars because of those changes, if that gives a clue to my movie anality.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION IF YOU CAN FIND IT.  One complaint is that the VHS had this cool "glitter" effect in a couple of scenes involving energon and Unicron internals. It is present in the VHS, It came out wrong in the Rhino version, and was totally gone in the 20th. Thanks for deleting part of my childhood.  In comparison to the Rhino version:   The remaster is terrible. Mine seems to flicker and have strange artifacts. The colors are totally off. Hot Rod is basically magenta/pink instead of red and his orange is not orange like an orange, it is orange like a cheaply made basketball.  Widescreen is fake. It is a cut fullscreen. I wish you weren't such a liar, Sony.  Cover art: D-. No detail. Looks like whoever does the new show drew it in an afternoon or two. The matrix looks like a honeydew. It would have got an F but Prime is on there.  Very few of the extras were worth it. I bought this for the remaster, hoping for some clean up and a restoration of the glitter effect, and they weren't there 
 Dave Barry's Bad Habits has comedy fiction writer Dave Barry trying his hand at the non fiction market.  Although he achieved quality work in this genre with later attempts such Homes and Other Black Holes, this book was clearly just cashing in on the success of his fiction with little effort put in whatsoever.  There's lots of references to Commies which either means Barry was extremely paranoid and brainwashed by his government of the time or he is retelling the same joke over and over again throughout the book, a joke that isn't that funny the first time and is really irritating when repeated and repeated and repeated.   Barry also insists on telling us his personal stories in this book, obviously the publishers had a word in his ear with future non fiction books as these stories are hardly evident in those books but unfortunately they are here and aren't that interesting.  Dave Barry can write some really good stuff, both fiction and non fiction.  Dave Barry's Bad Habits unfortunately is not one of those occasions. 
 This is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature. It is timely but it is not timeless.    Not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly. Not one scene is memorable. The true nature of the book -- soap opera-- is cloaked under its many pages.   Messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story, and she seems to have believed her publicity machine.  I can't believe that her husband, who a great literary critic, would not talk her out of publishing this.  Oh.  I forgot.  Money and fame trumps quality every time. 
 I have followed Ethan Mordden's journey through the Broadway musical with great interest and relish. He is a writer of wit and smarts and has the capacity to bring forgotten masterpieces to life on the page.   Why then is this final instalment riddled with agressive and irrelevant snipes at "the Left"? It's as if he wants to draw some link between the decline of the musical in cultural terms with what he calls the "moral relativism" of American liberals, but his subject matter consistently lets him down. He is unable to make the case, so he resorts to unworthy sniping instead. If it's nlot relevant, leave it out.     What is it with Broadway commentators? Mark Steyn too tries to square his reactionary politics with his love for perhaps the DEFINITIVE expression of American Liberal Art - the Broadway Musical.   It leaves a sour taste in the mouth. I will read his 30s instalment when published next year, but I find myself already armed with intellectual "pre-emptive strikes" against what he may conclude about the work of, say, Marc Blitzstein.  Ugly. 
 While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.  I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.  Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear 
 There are better books out there. This is a big waste of money. The book was not what I was expecting 
 This is not an easy book. The language is preety tough and the writer seems to assume that you already know C. The terminology is hard to understand. I went and bought an oreily book and I learnt alot more from that smaller book than this book 
 I must say, selling a dated book like this when you're talking about Websites is a shame.  Sure some ideas might be timeless but this book uses poor example after poor example to make its point.  I read another web book called "Don't make me Think" just before this one.  I guess it would be like following Elvis with a kindergarden play.  Save your money.  Need I say more. 
 There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment! 
   Bad script. You cannot expect Cuba Gooding, a fine actor, to do something with nothing. General Burt Reynolds in full dress uniform smoking a pipe? The always dynamic James Woods is even restrained from his usual machine gun mouth didactic style. Now Angie Harmon does get a chance to act, but with who?    Secret Service Agent Cuba deflects a bullet with his hand which inadvertantly kills the President. It was a magic bullet because, miracle of miracles, no damage was done to his hand. In an overwhelming display of guilt he tries to drink himself to death only to be awakened by reporter Angie to whom he promptly farts in the face. That's just the first 15 minutes folks.   We then get treated to the conspiracy and a whole lotta killing going on. Extreme closeups, handheld cameras, and of course the filtered color to heighten suspense.   The ending is the final lowpoint of the film. How did the killer procure and finance all this? And after all they've been through Agent Cuba punks out and refuses to tell reporter Angie.   Anne Archer, one of my alltime favorites, has a supporting role as The First Lady, who is also a painter. She is lovely and so are the paintings.   It's a shame but it could have a contender thriller 
 This is one of the worst game guides I have read in my life...and I've read a few. I got it back in '97 when the game first came out and spoiled everything (even THE big event at the end of the first disc). I later got the guide from Versus Books and it blew this pathetic book out of the water. It spoiled nothing and had twice the amount of useful secrets (including materia combos). Don't waste your time (and money) with this joke. Thankfully, BRADYGames realized its idiocy, fixed it, and got it right for FFVIII's guide (which basically aped FFVII's Versus Books' guide's style). Then they ruined it again with that awful, useless FFIX guide. I guess money grubbers never learn. And guys, you're supposed to be reviewing the GUIDE, not the game.. 
 Ugh. Reminds me of that famous quote by Moliere:  "Writing is like prostitution. First you do it for love, and then for a few other close friends, and then for money."  She was sort of like a political version of Anais Nin, only, without the literary imagination or talent. But she has joined the ranks of the elect, and became one of the Kewl Kids, so, I guess that is why this Dog of a book got published 
 I wanted a high quality yoga mat that was long in length because I am a tall person.  I thought I had picked the perfect mat when I ordered this one.  I didn't have a problem with the length (although it smelled that new plastic stench) but I did have a problem with the weight.  This mat is HEAVY!  I knew it would be HEAVY when I purchased it and being a person in somewhat good shape I didn't think I would mind it but I didn't realize that it would be cumbersome.  The last straw that made me want to return it was when I was in a yoga class; sweating and I began to slip on the mat.  If I am going to spend this amount of money on a yoga mat I don't want any problems.  To Amazon's credit I was able to return it and they paid for postage.  If I would have had to pay for the return postage myself it would have cost a lot because of how HEAVY it is but I would have paid it anyway (that should tell you how much I didn't like it).  I am now looking for a long mat but lighter and toxic free.  I want something that will be biodegradable.  The problem now is there are so many mats available (too many choices can be just as frustrating as too few).  
 I didn't find much use for this book.  This author's explanations on "profiling" will not help anyone who has basic common sense. The profiling facts offered don't translate into real help in beating the types of poker players we often confront.  e.g. I'll paraphrase one profile: -People who refuse to tip the dealer after winning a hand are cheap and self-centered. People who do tip are typically compassionate and more likely to have a feel for what other people are doing.  Do you want one more?  OK. -People who dress smartly, wear expensive clothes and play in low-stakes poker games probably don't care as much about the money involved than the thrill of playing the game.  If these common sense facts are new to you, and you think they can help you play better, then buy this book.  If not, save your money 
 Scarcely have I ever seen a book (or should I say pamphlet, since it can be read in less than an hour) that has such widely divided opinions on it.  Is it dictation from an extraterrestrial being?  Is it a rare glimpse into the uneditted subconscious?  Or is it the rantings of a madman?    Do yourself a favor and read a copy of the text online before you buy the book.  Then at least you know what you're getting yourself into.  It says something about mankind that we constantly search for "secrets" to success, when most of them are posted in plain view, but are just too unpalatable for 99% of people to handle.  Or you can ignore my advice and "Do what thou wilt". ; 
 They could have crammed alot more vagina in there. If they title something vagina monolgues it ought to be all about vagina.  I don't want to hear alot of whining about Bosnia and the Salem Witch Trials.  Give me vagina, vagina and more vagina 
 I personally feel that the  the book is small, being rightly meant to be carried by residents in wards, but cramped with borrowed information which exceeds the capacity of the book. A lot of it feature in other standard texts and nothing is new.The algorithms too are borrowed. Information on antibiotic usage and common tropical disorders in detail are lacking. Unnecessary publicity is being given to the book and The Osler Medical Handbook by Cheng and Zaas is far superior to this in all aspects. Another important aspect is that students reading the book do not read standard texts and are clearly at a disadvantage while appearing in examinations.The book needs to be rewritten in another format to be successful.

 This was a howler... Brown is so ignorant about intelligence gathering, computers, and NSA that there was no way to suspend disbelief and just go for the ride. Brown needs to learn to research his storylines, and then he needs to learn to write a lot better (even DaVinci Code suffered from bad writing), and he needs a better editor who will guide him on his way 
 This CD was a big disappointment. It was one song after another that sounded like the last. By the time I was halfway through a song, I found myself fast-forwarding to the next track. It would be OK as background music but otherwise I find it pretty musically boring 
 I read this book partially because I had to for a class, partially a suggestion from my dad because he'd read Gleick's other books.  I read about halfway through it and, I must say, for a book about how the world is getting too fast, this book jumped around pretty quickly.  It'd be talking about watches for about 6 pages (which was the longest chapter I got to), then the next chapter would come, it'd be less than half that length and about TV and newscasters.  Seriously, it seemed like it had ADD!  I grew up in this faster-paced world and I know that it's faster than what used to be.  I hear stories, I know that television didn't exist a hundred years ago, and I certainly don't need 281 telling me that my generation has it bad because everything's sped up, especially when the chapters could most definately be cut in half because all you need to read is about the first half of any chapter to get what you'd like out of it.  Not to keep rambling, but we all know the world's faster, so why don't we just slow down what we can and don't waste our time reading this book?  
 This is silly and simplistic. If only the world were like this. Moving sidewalks, free electricity, teleportation, hallucinogens for breakfast.  I really cant believe cambridge publishes stuff like this. I wouldnt even espect this from que at there worst.  The author should stick to nursury rhymes. This is nothing but a hoax. 
 Without playing too much to the author's obvious biases, I can only say he has wrought a finely detailed purse from a sow's ear. But it still remains a sow's ear.   Lieven is anti-American. But, for what good reason? Really none. He has a cultural/historical grudge and axe to grind as he projects much of his own country's history on its long departed sibling, America. This grudge has, of course, been held because America has done so very well without the English. If anyone has an imperialist attitude, it is Lieven and his countrymen. The English have characterized Americans as rude, coarse savages, as were the Australians -- the latter perhaps the preeminent example of land clearing for the imperial cause, if there ever were one. One need only speak to the English about President George W. Bush, and it becomes clear they believe him to be a stupid cowboy in the most stereotypical way.   While Lievan poses Americans as Jacksonian oppressors clearing the land of savages, it has historically been the British who have colonized and exploited so-called savage lands they could rape for England's gain. This cannot be entirely said for America, except with respect for the American Indian and African slave.   Clearly, the English colonists were in America to exploit the lands and peoples. But for many other settlers the former problem was, arguably, not so much the conquering of distant lands for personal gain as it was one of ineptitude. Many American settlers did not foresee the hostility of indigenous peoples. Faced with the proposition of life and death, settlers felt compelled to defend their property -- even more, to defend the land that stood breach between sustenance and starvation. Slavery cannot be so explained.  Contrary to Lieven's oversimplified thesis, America has been host to the many masses of people's from distant lands. Rather than clear its land of savages, some observors would surely say America has filled its land with such so-called savages. Indeed, the melting pot never was and never will be. In that respect America is more like France in that through its benificence the door has been opened to a host of problems.   The question now is how America will deal with rapidly encroaching Islamists and Islam itself, the breeding ground from which such extremists spring. The same cannot be said for Christianity. While Islam promotes offensive warfare and the capturing of slaves, Christianity promotes peace and the sane acceptance of one's plight, should it be as slave.   France dealt with the Muslims with a light hand and is now a nation filled with fuming Islamic discontents rioting in the streets and burning thousands upon thousands of vehicles, damaging private property and otherwise undermining the rule of law. One might ask, "Are they savages?" Well, not neccessarilly so. But many hold values that are destructive to the very fabric of a nation. We can trace such failures back to, at least, Algeria. Should America allow itself to become another France? We have opened the floodgates. How should we close them 
 I love cozies and am very fond of the Miss Julia series.  I had to lower my rating of this book because there is a 98 page reminiscence in the middle of it that provides nothing new to the loyal reader of this series. That's about 1/3 of the book. Very disappointing. 
 I did finally get to the end of this book, but it was just out of stubborness. Not worth the effort. A book review of about 10 pages would have been a better way to learn a little about this subject, 
 Its very sad to see how music has turned into a display of depressing,boring talentless garbage like this.I remember when you actually had to have talent to be a musician.Ratt,L.A.guns,GnR,Skid Row,now those are REAL bands.Creed is about a step up from Nirvana!Scott Stapp is a stupid loser who has the most annoying,monotone voice with no range at all.I don't know how you can call this guy a singer.The guitarist plays like a beginner and couldn't play a solo or any lead for that matter if his miserable life depended on it.Typical garbage from a typical band of recent years,no balls,no hooks,no talent and no longevity.I can't imagine how anyone could listen to this band 
 There is frankly no 'truth' to be found in this publication.  Aside from the previously circulated speculation regarding Hillary Clinton's political aspirations and orentation, her knowledge of and duplicity inside the Lewinsky affair, and her march to the Senate, this work is void of anything but base conjecture and one-sided analyses which offer no depth and villify the women's movement in 21st century America at large.  I had the double misfortune of perusing this volume via CD.  The material is made far less credible by Mr. Klein's own wheezy and wet-sounding reading of his work.  I address this first because I am part of a large number of technoservants who spend 8-10 hours per day with no diversions during a monotonous coding job but for headphones, and I want explicitly to warn any readers from the audio version of this work.  It begins with an inane and unintentionally ridiculous buzzing sound from somewhere at the top of Klein's palate and carries on with sardonic emphasis placed on repeated terms such as:  'lesbianism', 'leftist' and 'aspiration'.  Spaced at roughly equal intervals (making one further question the very validity of research), Klein gleefully quotes Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, their aides and supporters, and the altogether too-rare addition of Clinton apoligists in making vulgar statements.  A professional narrator understands the proper treatment of the profanity that occurs (and is only attributed to the Clinton camp) in situations such as this, and Klein clearly does not.  Klein's very decision to narrate his own narrative is a poor one, and further displays the partisanship that he clearly wishes to convey with every written word of it.  As to the substance, and contrary to the title, there are no revelations about Mrs. Clinton contained anywhere within this narrative.  And I sincerely mean that - Klein has acheived no investigative credibility in simply regurgitating what is already known about the Senator.  The speculations regarding her sexuality (or, as Klein would argue, her very lack thereof), her role in Mr. Clinton's sexual escapades and the Lewinsky affair, and the politicking that took place in New York are either matters of public record or outright conjecture that would make Kenneth Starr look like a law-and-order hawk.    With reference to what the title leads the casual browser to believe is the centerstone of the book (what she knew about the Lewinsky affair), Klein does nothing but recirculate rumors and ideas that any half-informed person has already heard:  that Hillary knew about Bill's affair with Monica, that she did nothing to stop it, and even that she was reponsible (!!!) for it because it was her connections that lead to Lewinsky's entrance to the White House.  There is a contradictory juxtaposition here - Klein leads the reader on into this affair shortly after explaining that a young Hillary Rodham launched a verbal tirade against harrassment of interns while an intern herself.  Klein mistakenly presumes that everyone will nod at his faulty logic (that Hillary became the enabler of a concept she defames), yet it actually illustrates that Hillary is what she claims to be:  her own woman, independent of Bill himself.  As a disclaimer, I do not support Hillary Clinton.  I believe that she is a disengenuous person, willing to sacrifice her own rather confrontational ideas in favor of pursuit of public office.  But Klein makes this argument foolish.  His barely disguised anymosity for the Democratic party at large and his not-at-all disguised disdain for feminism which borders on outright sexism within this very narrative (he frequently charactarizes Hillary's crowd as a group of butch supporters of what HE has dubbed 'lesbianism') is nothing short of inane.  This narrative is poorly organized, and the silly quips with which he ends each of the far too numerous 'chapters' are representative of, well, nothing at all.  Possibly the saddest commentary I can offer is that this narrative is wrought with inconsitency on both an intellectual and factual level (as Klein altogether too often relies on sources who 'jumped ship' from the Clinton camp and he treats his conjecture as actual evidence, often citing 'facts' that are no more than his own speculation of Hillary's mindset), and has no organization to fall back on except the aforementioned large number of 'chapters'.  This work just rambles on and on while saying, well, nothing.  Finally, readers may chuckle to see that Klein has printed a number of glaring grammatical errors:  at one point he says that Hillary wore contact lenses that make her eyes 'bluer'.  In summation, this work needs to carry the disclaimer:  "Paid for by the Republican National Commitee" in exactly the same way the Michael Moore's "Faranheit:  911" needed a discalimer for the Democratic party.  That way the casual browser or, in my case, the frankly interested citizen preparing to make voting decisions for the 2008 primaries would just keep browsing.  There is nothing in Klein's work that suggests any effort on his part to search for the 'truth' he erroneously claims to offer; only the 'cut-and-paste' [... 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 This thing never worked out of the box.. not worth trying to RMA it for the low cost of it, but dont recommend it. 
 Just because you start doing Neil Young inspired music doesn't make it mature or creative.  I too miss Speedy Marie.  Maybe I'm just old 
 This toy can't be unsed unless you go online and "update" it.  We have spent countless hours trying to "update" this toy - and ther is always a problem.  The website is down or some other technical problem.  Then IF the website is up - you go through the whole process and the toy still does not update - so it is unusable!  It is a complete waste of money 
 I think Steve Seim's review is excellent. The book is a famous statement of an editorial point of view, namely the communitarian claim that individualism has led to the incoherence of Americans' religious and moral claims. But like so many books, the authors dissemble to pretend they're scientifically reporting objective news rather than a kind of editorial. In this sense, the book is not substantially different from the kind of pseudo-science we've come to expect from sociologists, who, after conducting some interviews and handing out some loaded surveys, tell us "what's really going on" with the "modern American woman" or "Generation X" or, in this case, the "modern [misguided] liberal American." I, for one, view such work as social criticism vital to our society, and it makes thoughtful reading, but it is not scientific, and I wish we could get beyond this need to justify such claims with "scientific" surveys.  Considering this book represents more a kind of punditry than research, despite its claims, please consider reading the most famous response to the book, the chapters from Jeffrey Stout's "Ethics After Babel" devoted to the book. Stout, in one instance, close-reads one of the interviews, in which a guy is asked what's important to him, and whenever he talks about "being good" and "being honest," the interviewers grill him "but why? but why?" until after many replies relating to maturing and learning from his experience, he finally says something like "it benefits me to live a life of honesty" so the authors end the interview and conclude he's a rabid individualist whose only basis for his ethics is egocentric utilitarianism. They did not, for example, explore whether he has a rather rich concept of personal honor, or even a sense of Stoic maturity, either of which seems a more accurate way of describing his answers up to the point they choose to end on. Either alternative reflects a vocabulary of long standing moral traditions, which would contradict the authors' claims - ala Alisdair MacIntyre-- that modern liberal Americans have no such vocabulary.  In fact, I find it rather hilarious that they use this subject as the quintessential amoral individualist, since communitarian founding father Aristotle says repeatedly throughout the Ethics that living a life of virtue must benefit the individual, for to say the opposite would be akin to saying that giving a plant sunshine doesn't benefit the plant.  Of course this connection of virtue and human benefit is problematized in other ethical systems, but, still, it's funny to me that Arisotle could be characterized as lacking a moral framework because he connects living virtuously with personal benefit.  In any case, reading both this book and Stout, you're in a good position to come to your own conclusions 
 George Strait can make good music and albums, but the songs he did for his only movie Pure Country sound flat and dull.  Heartland's the only good song. The rest of the album is a wastleland of dull ballads and uptempo country songs that would be better sung at a lost bar in Arizona.  I was a little disturbed that an artist of George's high caliber would record these songs.  Avoid this one at all turns!  
 Although I enjoyed the story itself, this deluxe edition really didn't do anything for me. The book is 9.5 x 13 which makes it awkward to handle, hard to read and difficult to store. Fernando Duval did the illustrations and are alright at best. Supposed to be limited to 1000 copies. The book is autographed by Duval but not numbered. Not that it would make any difference. Overpriced, stick to the regular hardbound edition unless you are into odd-sized books. 
 If you like Richard Cheese, quirky covers, Squirel Nut Zippers, Misfits, Louie Prima, SAVE YOUR MONEY. I like the Devo and Ramones EZ listening covers but this is lame Casio synth organ horns, not lounge music. Think Mystery Science Theater closing theme. (Sorry Joel! Big Fan). If you realy want this album and you live in Los Angeles, I plan to wing my copy onto Interstate 5. Wish I'd read the reviews like you are. Try some Me first and the Gimme, Gimme or Dread Zeppelin. 
 Most of the songs chosen were not major house records in terms of popularity or sales and did not gather any underground following 
 Taming A Liger: Unexpected Spiritual Lessons From Napoleon Dynamite contains a lot of unexpected things, mainly that this book is a fraud.  There is a huge difference between Spiritual Lessons and 24 chapters of Jesus.  This book is nothing by a tool to try to make you believe in Jesus.  What's next from these guys `Spiritual Lessons from Porno'?  Save your money and don't buy this toilet paper.   
 There was one scary moment in this movie--the quick scene showing the girl in the closet when she dies..now that was creepy. I then awaited more moments like that.  Nothing. nada. Lame.  Tries way too hard to be creepy and artsy and just landed up being dumb.  And that young boy what is up with that?? He's trying to be like the kid in the Sixth Sense (who was brilliant and totally believable).  This movie did not scare me.  And the idea of people being afraid to use VHS tapes after this? Come on.  
 I'm a fan of Elvis and a fan of most of the music on this album.  I'm rating this 1-star not on the quality of the music, but on the quality of the product.  I have over 500 albums in my collection and have ripped all of them to my PC for use with my iPod.  This is the ONLY album I own that I cannot add to my digital collection.  I  have to admit that I kind of have a guilty conscious when it comes to buying music, and I've paid for 99% of my collection as opposed to "acquiring" free copies.  I paid for this album just like all the others, but because of SONY/BMG's "copy-protection" software none of my computers will even recognize it as a CD.  Yes, I can listen to it in any other standalone CD or DVD player, but what does that mean?  I can enjoy over 7000 songs on one convenient storage device but have to keep this special disc set aside for my "protection".  I know I'm kind of ranting, but SONY's CP issues have been well documented and I'm not alone in my frustration.  Just remember people: it's Elvis.  The same songs of his have been rereleased 100 times in 100 different packages.  You can find all of these songs somewhere else. 
 I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but "ain't no way" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't "make" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!! 
 Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.  Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him   advice.  Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).  The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.  It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.  See the movie 
 Hmmm, don't eat anything with a face?  The arrogance in that is astounding...so the way it works is, we gotta face, so since we're above EVERYTHING, anything that looks kinda like us must be worthy of life.  Geeez.  Aren't there beautiful ocean creatures that don't have a face...okay to eat them?  I've noticed how plants will move toward the sun...I guess that's just a quirk, guess it doesn't really mean they have consciousness or have a strong desire to live...  I s'pose whatever higher being planned all this was kinda off the mark 'cause he/she made the boo-boo of having animals eat animals.  That couldn't possibly be "right."  Um, yeah...    Native Americans knew...ALL life is sacred.  They thanked those animal beings whose lives were sacrificed for their nourishment, for their survival.  They respected ALL life.  We are not above animals, we are part of the animal kingdom.  We are part of this PERFECT system called Nature.  It is twisted thinking like "eat nothing with a face" that reeks of a sense of superiority (and judgment) that is most unwarranted.  It isn't about not eating them, it's about respecting them, eating them (or not) as we personally intuit for our own health in a healthy way (not all day, everyday...) Not locking them in cages where they can't move, not torturing them in labs, not reveling in the "sport" of killing them, not poisoning them with drugs to make them fatter or whatever...allow them to live in peace and when we must take them for our nourishment, do it in a humane way...animals die, people die...such is the nature of this existence.  Death is but a doorway for all life, and it's essential for the continuation of life on this planet.  Believe it or not, I've been both vegetarian and vegan, because I adore animals.  But I could not have been more unhealthy on those types of diets, and I find it sad that the majority of vegetarians I've come across rarely look robust and healthy.  They are generally pale and thin, even Linda McCartney died of breast cancer.  I'm not saying it's because she didn't eat meat, but her diet certainly didn't save her from that vicious disease.  Vegetarianism is definitely not for everyone, and my guess is that if it's healthy for anyone, they are in the minority 
 I would first like to start by saying, "What Happened." I loved all three of Noire's other books however this book was a total blur. It had a decent plot, no rising action, a predictable climax, and a twisted ending. It would have been wise to concentrate on one or two characters. However, this books was maybe 300 pages but had like 20 different characters. Prince is the only artist that I know who has the ability to drop new material every three monthes. Word to the wise Noire, "All money ain't good money." In other words, putting 50 Cent's name on a book doesn't mean anything to an intellect. 50 cent can afford to flop he's rich, however you are not established yet. 
 This is useless if you know any Spanish.  I thought it would contain idioms but this contains only the kind of information you'd need for simple travel.  Save your money 
 These trains are very neat and my sons loved them when we first got them.  They each have been through two sets with the same result...the water leaks out after you've had them awhile.  They are not worth the money.  I highly recommend investing in another train instead of the aquarium cars.  This was the first time my guys have been disappointed with a Thomas product.  
 Horne's book is yet another politiically correct account of Katrina. 1. Horne's newspaper, The Times-Picayune, was founded in 1837, almost a century before the Army Corps of Engineers began designing and building the levees surrounding New Orleans. It is the only daily newspaper. Before Katrina, the Picayune did extensive reporting on the effects of a major hurricane striking the city. But it did not retain experts to evaluate the design and condition of the levees. Horne, wasn't that a breach of trust? 2. Before Katrina, the city had already become uncivilized. The policies of former Mayor Maurice Landrieu drove whites from the city and made blacks dependent on the government. On August 29, 2005, the city was 70% black and 30% white; the city government (mayor, council, judges, police chief, fire chief, district attorney) were almost 100% black; the president of the electricity and gas utility was black; the superintendent of the Sewerage and Water Board was black. Corruption in city government was systemic. On August 29, there were more than 15 separate federal investigations into corrupt conduct by members of former Mayor Marc Morial's administration.  Some of his relatives are now in federal prison. The Picayune covered the corruption. But it did not relate that corruption to the city's capacity to respond to "the big one". Horne, wasn't that a breach of trust? 3. Everyone sympathizes with the blacks from the Lower 9th Ward who refused to evacuate the city and sought shelter at the Superdome and Convention Center. But their conduct was reckless. The evidence does not support their claim that there was no transportation for them. Busses from the city and black churches had been available, but they refused to use them. By contrast, almost all whites who lived in the same ward heeded the warnings and fled the city. Also, pictures of flooded cars prove that private transportation was also available to them. Wealthy blacks like Fats Domino refused to leave their homes because they feared looting. (Their fears were well founded). They made a serious mistake by staying in the city. Horne, wasn't that a breach of trust? 4. Horne does not dwell on the fact that the two parishes south of the 9th Ward (St. Bernard and Placquemines)sustained more property damage, but less loss of life. For months, the media ignored them as if they were invisible. That fact created the false impression that blacks were the only victims of Katrina. Horne, was that a breach of trust? 5. Another area of the city that the mediia ignored was Lakeview, a middle, upper-middle and wealthy area. Most of the houses are still vacant. That fact created the false impression that the poor were the only victime of Katrina. Horne, was that a breach of trust? 6. Horne does not dwell on the fact that most of the people who risked their lives to rescue the blacks in the 9th Ward were white. To be sure, there were a few black first responders. But most were white. Without doubt, the U.S. Coast Guard deserves the most credit for its non-stop work. Also, there were many individuals who risked their lives to save others. Side-stepping this fact created the false impression that whites let blacks suffer and die. Horne, wasn't that a breach of trust?  7. By now, you get the thrust of my review. Horne's book creates a distorted picture of what really happened before, during and after Katrina. Of course, FEMA, Bush, Blanco and Nagin bear different degrees of responsibility. But history will show that others were also responsible. Horne's book may have been politically correct enough to warrant a Pulitzer Prize, but it may not be truthful enough to win the judgment of history 
 This is a beautiful book with filled wonderful ideas.  However, the recipes are very bad.  I am an experienced baker who attempted a few of cakes with along with a chef, whose history includes an honors degreee from the French Culinary Institute in NYC.  We both agree - the recipes are just plain bad.  The directions and instructions are not only vague, they assume you can get from point A to point D.  If you want to make the cakes in this book, find the recipe elsewhere.  I would actually like to know how the author made the cakes in the photographs, because she certainly did not rely on these recipes alone 
 There is a big adlarian school at the U of C.  Nietzsche is a required class there.  He says that the belief in Christian predestination is a superiority compex.  An infieriority complex would be a clinical failure. But the infieriority feeling is normal and productive.  But the person can get overwhelmed and becomes neurotic and needs a socratic kick in the pants because he is "foundering".  If he doesn't he will start to psychotically believe in predestination and become a real danger to God and man. Alfred Alder is truly connected to Fascism /Nazism /Behavioral Science/ Network Marketing/ GlennGary Glen Ross/ Life Coaches etc...  For example they always interview the family members separately. That is because the assumption is that they are part of the reason why he is unmotivated.  They push and marshal and coach the family memebers to not put up with any more mangy excuses.  Love is not spiritual but only human and social interst is defined by increasing group think (cooperation).  In other words love is God but God is not love.   I happen to like some of those who are unshamed to refer to themselves as "hardshell hyperCalvinists". Until recently I tought that "hyper" was an inhearently negetively loaded word.  I don't agree that Arminians are unsaved but sometimes I am not entirely offened by the other truly superior wisdom that these individuals have.  Some of them are people who aren't even Calvinsts themselves but thier briliant unregenerate reprobated human minds have mastered the language of intense hatred.  But that certainly doesn't mean that there is a general call!  You can still get a linguistics major at MBI!  Show me China in the Bible?  (I know that the characters all contain Biblcal types and fuigures.)  Even Hank Hannegraph leans more towards that God forsees which babies will choose Him and damns the rest of the little vipers to hell forever!  But I am a supralapsarian and proud of it!  GOD WAS NOT CONSTRAINED TO BALANCE OUT REPROBATION WITH ANY ELECTION! And I believe in God's concealed commandments! Have you run across that one yet?  Hypercalvinsts only believe in God's concealed will!  I beleive that sin is OF GOD not just from Him!  Sin is part of his Spirit!  That would be because He is infinte and we are finite. Even though FINTIE sin is IN HIM HE completely subsumes all of it by virtue of His INFINITE VIRTUE.  HERE IS THE MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR EXISTANCE:  x/infinity  = .00000000000000  whereas "x" includes all of Heaven and Hell and the Angles and Satan and the world system and all of the tihings and people in it good and bad.  "X" in anything and everything that is not OF GOD.    The Buddists say that there is "no distinction between God and history" and they mean that there is only history. But the computer can't be God or else it is an idol. And "I" am not God or else I am God.  If you accept history and philosphy then you also accept the Holy Roman Catholic Transubstantianted Empire/World System. Therefore there is no such thing as "history and philosphy" if we are to make way for the OMNIPRESENCE of GOD. AS OMNISCIENCE IS ALL ENCOMPASSING, SO IS OMNIPOTENCE, and... so NO ONE AND NOTHING IS TRULY PRESENT BUT OMNIPRECENSE.  IN OTHER WORDS I DON'T TRULY BELIEVE IN PREDESTINATION BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THE EXISTANCE OF HISTORY OR PHILOSOPHY!!!! TO THINK OR PERCEIVE DOES NOT IN FACT IMPLY EXISTANCE!  ETERNAL CONSCIOUS TORMENT IS THE GREATEST DOCTRNE AND GATEWAY AND ULTIMATE BIBLCAL DETERMINAITON OF ELECTION.  AND OF COURSE IT IS INFINITE TORMENT FOR ALL ETERNITY.  Alfred Alder was not a Christian 
 This flick is like a prequel to "Hogan's Heroes."  The Allied POWs are plucky, cocky and handsome.  The German soldiers who guard them are bumbling oafs.  At the end of the movie the German guns come out and many of the POWs are slaughtered.  Disgusting 
 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 Overall Bernanke does a good job at looking at different theories, but his theories on the dangers of deflation have been refuted by many authors. It is too bad that this theory clouds his vision, or else his treatment of the depression would have a lot more authority.  For the economist, I would highly recommend "America's Great Depression" by Murray N. Rothbard. He is by far the most thorough in his treatment of the period, delivering the most compete and well founded theory for the cause of the Great Depression, too bad Bernanke hasn't read it 
 Terrible, terrible CD. I got it two day's ago and could not even listen through the whole CD. Regina plays the violin and the music with such bad taste. What a disgrace to the once Paganini's violin. I can't believe I spent my money on this. It should not even have 1 star 
 This book was a favorite with my children many years ago, so now as a grandmother, I was excited about the prospect of introducing it to my grandaughter.  Like so many others, I was surprised and disappointed to see so many pages missing.  Wondering if any of the used books available could possibly include the original?  Now I'm on a search for the original 
 I wish I had read all of these reviews before I purchased the book.  I recently bought the book and went on a spree at the health food store!  Then I started thinking about some things that don't add up.  For instance we need protein, but her suggestions are to eat tuna, sardines, and rice and beans.  Some options!  I have been pleased with the recipes I've tried so far, and I intend to keep using many of them.  However, they weren't written by a chef so they can be a little vague and hard to follow.  I've decided to get a couple of other more highly rated books.  I'll let you know how it goes 
 Look...to be fair, one man's BOTE is another man's "Manos". What I mean by that is some people may love this ep, but I personally didn't find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub-average riffing doesn't save it. The best lines that Mike & the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says. Unfortunately, the feature's horrible pacing, slow dialogue scenes, and atrocious acting are not enough, and it seems like the writers took a break on this one. Of course, even weak MST3K is better than pretty much any other show, but I must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a Season 1 episode (the riffing is sparse and not really funny). If you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it's best, get either "Manos: Hands of Fate" or "Red Zone Cuba" 
 I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way 
 I read parts of this "book" until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and I immediately returned it to the library. What a stultifying simpleton this man is. He is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas. And unsurprisngly, this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the "David Letterman Show" and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity. First, he claimed that no one should criticize President Bush "because we're at war and it's no good for the country." Come again? I say that such a statement is "no good" for democracy, which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about. The right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the First Amendment. And this man is a graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government? Also, he insisted that Cindy Sheehan, whose son was killed in Iraq, not have the right to be publicly upset with President Bush and the invasion of Iraq because "she's connected with left-wing elements in this country." What left-wing elements? I feel that Cindy Sheehan is as connected to left-wing elements as much as Bill O'Reilly is associated with logical reasoning. 
 The Amazon release information says that this book was released 2007-01-12. That is not correct. This is a 1st edition sourcebook, released back in 2004 
  The person is trying to interpret the quran and is really not clear about what the verses actually mea 
 So this is what the onetime flagship of the east coast has to offer us. a bunch of remix's with washed up rappers(Craig Mack comes to mind). Hip hop turned pop. BIG gotta be spinnin in his f***in' grave. Knowing he use to roll with this sellout b**ch puffy. Jackin' beats, spittin other ni**as verses, rappin about his wealth. Everything about this ni**a is wrong. He's not even talented, just ridin a dead rapper's street cred. F*** badboy for life 
 I had the misfortunate to hear these little twerps attempt to choke out some lyrics, if you can call them that, and I have to admit...it made me cry.  Not with joy, but with shame, for having forced my ears to endure such a terrible ordeal.  Woe is me.   On a list of horrible atrocities commited by mankind, this record falls somewhere between N*Sync's first record and the actual Holocaust.  How people can give them five stars without Hell freezing over is beyond me 
 Well I now have a handle for my $250 I-Pod Nano. The arm snug would be a great idea if they maybe thought about who is probably going to buy this product and what they are going to be doing. First off I have to wear this arm band just short of the largest setting on my forearm because even at the largest setting it makes my arm fall asleep from lack of blood flow. So unless you are a skinny 140lb biker this probably won't fit you comfortably. The second issue is that there is not a locking mechanism for the strap so when I am working out with my muscles constantly contracting it just changes the strap size and I end up with my Nano on my wrist.   	Over all, this product is great if you are riding a bike or doing anything that doesn't cause you to move your arm a lot. So if you if you are planning on buying this for relaxing bike ride through the country it is well worth it. Planning on using your I-Pod to play angry music to help give you the strength do that one extra rep, don't bother. 	Bullet proof shield though is a must since those little screens get scratched so easily. 
 I'm sorry for Loga Ramin Torkian and Narada Productions, but this album is something everyone should AVOID TO BUY! I'm used to Ghazal's Persian and Indian Improvisations and as I rate 5 stars Kayhan Kalhor and Shujaat Husain Khan's works, I HAVE TO rate only 1 star (yet that's too much!!) this miserable, poor album: each track has no structure, no beginning, no close, no range. This 2002 year album has nothing to do with 2000 year Axiom of Choice's "Niyayesh" album, a wonderful piece of work, gorgeous and magnificent! I would never suggest "Unfolding" to a friend! (neither to an enemy!). I'd buy "Niyayesh" instead 
 I never received the product that I ordered - it was never delivered even though they said it was - someone was here all the time.  So I am very dissatisfied.  I don't like to order things and never receive them.  Reaga 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 I am an engineering student and currently in differential equations.  I bought this solutions manual to accompany the text book (which I also strongly don't recommend) and wish I had returned it to the bookstore in time.  Unforntuately, I am stuck with it now.  This solutions manual does not explain anything thoroughly.  Any questions with problems that I have, or anyone else in my class for that matter, are almost always skipped over as if the answer to the question is blatantly obvious.  You'll probably have much better luck researching the answers to your questions on the internet or just asking your professor to explain it, because this solutions manual is next to no help at all 
 Watching this film reminded me of how T-Rex swindled a bunch of screaming girls into believing he was the second coming of the Beatles. When in fact he was the inspiration for the Bay City Rollers and all the bad pop music that came after him. Interviews with producer Tony Visconti are so over the top it's pathetic. Visconti compares Bolan with Hendrix, the Beatles and has the audacity to say that he, Bowie and Thin Lizzy "wrote the book on British rock". Laughable.   For fun keep your eye on Bolan's guitar playing. His basic technique is playing an A7 chord incessantly and bursting into random three note lead runs that are comical. 
 OK, I love the Rev and I hate to talk trash about the new album, but it is a huge let down.  Granted it's still better than most other albums by other artists, but it lacks the guts of the other Rev albums.  The song writing and performances lack the depth of previous albums.  It sounds like they were thrown into a studio and told to put together an album in a week.  There are some good songs on the album - Indigo Friends, Callin' In Twisted - but overall it's just weak.  I saw them play about a month ago and they played some of the new songs.  The live execution was great.  Unfortunately it just didn't translate well to the album.  I'm all for the Rev stretching their legs and exploring new sounds, but in the past when they have done that (Space Heater, Spend a Night in the Box) it still had the depth and feel that the Rev is known for.  It may grow on me, but I listened to it four times in a row the day I got it, and it just didn't do it for me.  If I put together a Reverend Horton Heat "Greatest Hits" record, I don't think any of these songs would make it.  Sorry to be so rough on the guys -they really are an awsome band - but I'm disappointed that the new album lacks the guts and soul of they are known for 
 Anyone who can say, on page 6, that a man whose mother's death when he is 10 days old causes him to "suffer from a devastating loss and its concomitant anger" is more a cliched than a clear thinker 
 I was very disappointed with the ending of this new Danielle Steel.  It seemed like a very long read, with a very quick ending.  I have read every one of her books, and have never been so disappointed with a story until now.  I would not recommend this to anyone 
 I'm here to find replacement parts for this toy.  My daughter was working really hard to try to make something work on this, and right when she got it together, one of the wires attached to the light broke off, when she tried to put it into the coil to make the connection.   We can't solder it back in, there are no replacement parts and my daughter is crying at the kitchen table and we don't want to order another one, just to make her happy.   Seriously, this toy is a piece of crap.    I gave the toy high marks for educational value, because it teaches kids an important lesson.  Once corporations have your money, they don't care about whether or not you actually were able to use it, or have fun, or will need replacement parts, they only want to get MORE money off you, somehow.    Also, buyer beware is an important lesson.  
 Elia Kazan performed miracles on stage and screen, but he had the talent behind him or in front of him, namely Brando,Vivian Leigh, James Dean, Julie Harris, Natalie Wood, M. Clift, Lee Remick etc. He butchered Tennesse William's Cat On A Hot Tin Roof's third act, but it worked on the stage, and opened the doors for more buthering in the Elizabeth Taylor film with Paul Newman, directed by Richard Brooks.   Kazan collaborated with Arthur Miller on many projects, and we learn they shared Marilyn Monroe in bed..stated as a matter of course or as a funny sort of arrangement, not to put too fine a point on that novel and film (The Arrangement..Kazan's autobiography, as tasteless as anything he might have arranged with Miller and the unsuspecting Marilyn Monroe.)  Kazan did much to push Hollywood out of the censorship habits of scripting and acting and directing; he brought T. Williams' Baby Doll to the screen, never knowing it came from Chaucer,  with the great Carroll Baker and brought down the wrath of the Roman Cath. Church, not a bad thing to do. He also challenged old screen acting attitudes by placing Raymond Massey and James Dean in long emotional scenes together in East Of Eden, showing Massey's terrible  histrionics and narrow ideas about screen acting , driving Massey crazy. James Dean gave both Massey and Kazan lessons. It is interesting that Massey's performance was never re-done, but lies there , a weird contrast to Dean's greater talents, and Julie Harris' as well. Those dead zones in Kazan's work becoime more freqent as he pushes on into the 50's and 60's.  With Brando Kazan brought out the best to be sure; A Streetcar Named Desire was made into a movie, with that awful ending that Kazan thought was "Ok" again that lack of artistic insight. Furthermore, Kazan never liked Vivien Leigh as Blanche or as anything, which showed a disturbing deficit in Kazan's sensibilites about Tennessee Williams. Kazan never "got" Streetcar" and it shows in the way he tends to make Leigh as Blanche look like a woman afflicted with the disease of poetry,  a loser out for lust, namely Brando, who is irresistible to her. This shows no understanding of the play's subtleties.  The Cat On A Hot Tin Roof stuff is bad, the way Kazan re wrote it, with Big Daddy not returning in Act 3, which ruins the play completely. Thenm there are the put downs of Williams and William Inge too,the latter,  who wrote screenplays for Kazan, one Splendor In The Grass, beautifully written and acted, with the ususal Kazan blind spots: overacting fathers and mothers, like Karl Malden did in any Kazan film, or Andy Griffith in A Face In The Crowd. Kazan films do have scenes that are sheer melodrama, very TV, weakening many of his films. (Parenthetically, in Splendor In The Grass, where we have poetry ,William Wordsworth informing all of it,starting with the title,of course, all the way through the film. But with Kazan's peotic perspective we have cuts and changes that explain the many allusions to Wordsworth'sIntimations Of Immortality, from where the title comes,  the Kazan way,the Cliff Notes way..simplistic and very damaging to the central characters' roles and their final encounters with each other.   Kazan with Blanche in Streetcar, and with Wordsworth in Splendor In the Grass and so on... He never understood the life of the poetic mind beacuse he hadn't the training or talent, and he was therefore unable to cope with a James Dean or a Marlon Brando when they moved away from his reductionist  approach to all art.  Wild River with Montgomery Clift and Lee Remick is very good, and  Kazan could not get the audience to see the film, because he thought of Wild River in terms of receipts, not as classic or unique. And  so he reverted to imitation in Splendor in The Grass, a Rebel W/out a Cause feel to it, having ignored the Wordsworth themes written into it by Inge.    Indeed, an extraordinary career with other films touching , only touching, touchy topics,  such as Pinky, Gentleman's Agreement, Viva Zapata, Sea Of Grass, America America, and that uneven version of The Last Tycoon, with De Niro and Moreau in charge,thank God. (Ironically, De Niro's name in the film and the Fotzgerald novel is Monroe Starr.)Kazan could never shake the refernces to Marilyn Monroe, and by extention Miller. And we come to the worst moment in his career, After The Fall. It ended his success with everyone, and Arthur Miller was through as a successful playwright.(In the 2000nds Miller would approve opf a revival of After The Fall..the same reception ensued..the public still remembers Marilyn Monroe with fondness, great love in fact..Miller, like Kazan, did not see this and a lot more.)After The Fall is about Marilyn Monroe and it is a mean-spirited play about her, thinly disguised as a bitch baby of no importance. Miller thought of Marilyn as only a compositional resource for years, a ticket to fame in films. Butlook at The Misfits, and how Marilyn dominates with Clark Gable the entire film, with the help of Huston's script changes..Marilyn and Gable died after this film and so did Miller's film dreamsw.)In any case, the public in 1964 stayed away in droves from After The Fall, and all of Broadway and Hollywood and the public at large never forgave either of them. Others before Kazan and Miller had trashed Marilyn after her death with the same results: finished in show business.  Tony Curtis learned harsh lessons, as did Tony Randall, and many others, for their remarks about Marilyn's so-called lateness on the sets, and her drinking and drug use. Kazan and Miller thought they were above the low life trashers; they were not and were shunned.  But the worst was On The Waterfront, NOT Brando's performance, but the defense of informing which is what the film is all about. Kazan would have sold out anyone to keep his place in America America in tact; he named people with out a blink of the eye to a group(McCarthy's brownshirts) that could have taken over after Stalin died, and did, in the USA. Even Miller, when called, refused to name names, but Kazan did and he was a bastard to do it. It shows the very large dark spot of commoness in his life and work, a something missing in Kazan's idea of the age, a fatal,  profoundly disappointing stupidity, based on his survival instincts, impulses which places On the Waterfront, the ultimate homage in the age of MCarthy to informers, as art clearly in the service of evil and banality.   He did indeed need stars to get it all going, and other directors need them too, after all, you want talent like James Dean on every film you direct. However, Kazan 's work has the commercial taint to it; always,  there is bad secondary casting; his films preach and talk forever about the need to stand for something; he condemns the immoral, but always esteems the patriotic informer, and for this sensibility  he lost Brando forever for doing this in On The Waterfront. But look at Malden as the priest in this film..endless self-posturing, and self-justification;  and again in Streetcar, acting out Mitch rather than feeling his way around Blanche with his hyprocrisy, as Williams' wrote it.Vivien Leigh fights her way through to the climax of the scene with the lantern covering the light, with Malden reciting lines all over the place, garrulous and meaningless. Again, no poetic sense on Kazan's part, or any clue as to the significance of the scene, that's why Kazan could  so easily compromise on the gay issue here and again, on that absurd ending to the film, Streetcar Named Desire. All this is defensible to be sure, on some rhetorical level,  but there is that spot of commonness, that facist streak of the squeeler that covers Kazan's films with didacticism,an insincere hectoring of the themes of his pictures on racism and anti-smitism, a smallness, a Lilliputian mind esentially,  that tried to usurp Tennessee Williams' plays, trashed V. Leigh's art, thought Brando never did another good film after On The Waterfront (Last Tango In Paris, to name a few), who toyed with Marilyn Monroe , a n icon forever..Kazan never knew she was or could be that, nor did Miller...they thought they were the icons of the age, esp. Kazan, and he was not..noone went to see his very personal America America or his autobiographical pic, The Arrangement. They are self-serving, malicious, and, without Williams around or Inge or Steinbeck, poorly written, as, in America America he wants us to see the greatness of HIS arrival in America. How America is now twice blessed in his arrival, hence perhaps the repetitious title. In The Arrangement..a lurid Deborah Kerr(How could anyone conceive Deborah Kerr as this sort of non person; a career killing perfomanbce by Kirk Douglas, and so on..and the editing..horrible jumps and lurches forward and backward, signifying nothing. Kazan needed great stars, but he needed a script too, and imagination. By this time, the late 60s, his imagination had cancelled itself out, with Kazan's blocked mind about conscience, informing, facism, and Monroe.    But we look to others for greatness in every sense of that word..Huston, Wyler, Lang, Hawkes,and abroad, Kurasowa, Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman,  and a few others. Artists don't shoot other artists to get ahead, to shoot that next film. The low vibrations of such informing acts stick, and eventually produce After The Fall dramas, which make us question all that went before in Kazan's work.   Kazan said once that Gentleman's Agreement did not go far enough, there was a hestiancy in his(Kazan's) drive behind the film. Indeed, a hestiancy with anti-semitic issues, but not a hesitancy about naming in sheer ignorance of Stalin or anybody like him,  8 people who were ruined because of Kazan's stand against their freedom, and his liking of the ways of facism...an easy, evil political ideology that softens all of  his work, makes it luke warm, unspiritual,which it wants so despertely to be, and, except for Brando and all the stars of greatness,makes it a bit nauseating.   
 i really like the aesthetic of this film, but not much else.  the dialogue in particular is really trite.  the characters are all hackneyed caricatures - john lurie as an unconvincing pimp, tom waits as a burnt-out DJ, and roberto benigni as a crazy italian guy.  i didn't believe these might be real people for one second - they are very clearly "characters".  the film is beautifully shot in black and white, but jarmusch leaves out a few things that would make this film more convincing.  waits and lurie meet in prison after each was set-up for different crimes, but the film never delves into why they were set-up.  we see very little of the prison aside from their cell.  we don't see the escape until they're in the tunnel.  we never see any police or dogs, we just hear them.  the coming together of nicoletta and roberta is ridiculous.    2 stars for the cinematography, 0 for everything else 
 After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song "My Only" from the "Good as it gets"  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song 
 At first loved it because the travel system, with stroller, is so light and doesn't look doudy like other systems.  But: the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car. The straps never tangled, but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed. The carrying handle has to moved up/down with two hands, a button on each, that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle. Difficult to perform when you're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby. Yes it is a trendy color with the gray, but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe! It is horribly hot for the baby. Still love the stroller by combi, but I never recommend the car seat to ANYONE. Luckily, time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway. 
 Old Jules is not a bad book, it's just too long for one thing.  The characters and their lifestyle are quite unique but their lackluster day to day existence needn't have taken up so many pages.  If you want gripping, white-knuckle excitement, look elsewhere.  The book is interesting from a historical point of view maybe but it just wasn't my kind of read.  (Ho-hum........ 
 I was pretty dissapointed in this set. Perhaps it's better suited for an engineer. I bought 507 Mechanisms at the same time and found it to be much easier to understand even though it was originally published over 100 years ago. I sent this set back b/c it just wasn't worth the money to me 
 My first Philippa Gregory book was "The Queen's Fool"  which I throughly enjoyed.  I could not waited to have time to sit and read!  So as I was towards the end of "The Queen's Fool" I began to see what other books were available by this author.  I bought "The Virgin's Lover" since to seemed to follow "The Queen's Fool".  Within the first 36 pages, I was completely frustrated at the layout of the novel.  TOO MUCH BOUNCING ABOUT WITH THE TIME FRAME.  And the time frames within the book do not match those in "The Queen's Fool".  For instance, in "The Queen's Fool"  Queen Mary dies in Winter 1558 but in "The Virgin's Lover" The Queen dies in Autumn 1558.  Another example is Lord Robert.  In "The Queen's Fool" Lord Robert lives at St. James Palace (Autumn 1558) and presses Queen Mary to name an heir (Winter 1558).  However, in "The Virgin's Lover" Lord Robert is low man in court with no where to go but to his wife's StepMother's.                                                                   I think part of the problem with this type of time framing is the use Seasons.  Winter 1558....is this November December or January February?  Because further in the book the use of Winter 1558-59 is used. The back and forth at the beginning of the book set me up to confusion a few later chapters into the book.  I spent more time concentrating on keeping the time frame correct then actually enjoying the book which must be quite evident by now with me taking the time to write this review 
 In the first 2 films, the kid was left alone by accident. In this one, it is deliberate. That's right, the mother leaves her small child home alone by choice. The kid is an evil genius type who has more toys than the Mythbusters. His traps are meant to maim or kill the so-called bad guys, who are so unbelievably stupid it is difficult to accept they would be smart enough to steal a computer chip. Speaking of the chip -- something like that would fail if it were handled by so many people; it has to be in an anti-static protective bag, not in a toy car. But most Hollywood types don't seem to know anything about computers. Or the range of a toy car's remote control. Or a TV remote control. Or how a small child could put barbells on a roof. Or move a 4x8 sheet of plywood...or.... In short, just about everything in this movie stretches credulity beyond even cartoon violence. This also proves that to pull off this concept you need a cast of people with talent. The original 2 films work only because of a good cast. It certainly isn't the writing. Left to the writing alone, this type of film just fails. It also leaves one with a sense of mean-spiritedness at the heart of the film. And that is because it is such an unnecessary sequel with ties to the originals in name only. 
 I bought this book with the expectation that it would be another "Mists". Unfortunately, I was quite mistaken. I found this book to be so boring that I didn't even make it through the whole thing--I kept putting it down and picking it up a few weeks later thinking I would eventually finish it, but I never did. For one, Helena may start off as a strong character, but once her husband and son enter the picture, she becomes content to just sit back and watch all of the excitement happen to them. I found it odd that a woman with such intellect and education would quietly retire to her country house, only kept informed by letters and the once-every-few-years visit of her son. I'd recommend not reading this one. Read "The Mists of Avalon" again instead 
 Years after its release I find myself writting what I consider a completely biast review for this film (being somewhat of a Star Wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before). Let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film. For me, I grew up watching the original Star Wars (now titled Episode IV, A New Hope). When the original Star Wars came out, it changed the way people looked at Sci-Fi. I saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets, props, costumes, etc. It was the best eye-candy of its time by far. Substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of "holes" in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters. Almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different. Star Wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world, amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial, even the lowest budget Sci-Fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at. Effects do not make a movie and "Attack of the Clones" is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter. Awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither. In retrospect, I wish that George Lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than C3PO and R2D2 (the latter even flies! Imagine that, more capabilities than in the future). This premise is even absurd for the world of Star Wars. According to the story, Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old. As I'm typing this review I can imagine myself typing it with a Royal ribbon typewriter, that just wouldn't happen. It is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that Lucas created but the movie is full of them. He doesn't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy (I,II,III) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier, or why everything looks dated thirty years from now. In his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around. I, however have a solution for all these. George Lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists. Everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past. Then, you could buy all versions of the original trilogy (IV,V,VI). As originally shot, the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters, and the "Ultimate Enhanced Version" to better match the second trilogy (I,II,III). Maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing. Then, you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling (ie., compelling characters, continuity, interesting plotlines, etc). The only reason I give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ILM still makes the film worth watching at least once. Otherwise, I rather watch "Serenity" which has a more Star Wars feel to it than this Star Wars film. The nickname of "Mannequin" to "Annakin" is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story 
  If you're not offended by the contents of this book, there are three possibilities: 1) You live in a compound prostrate to a tyrannical religious leader who allows you little to no access to the outside world. 2) You're regularly featured in D Magazine. 3) You sustained a serious brain bleed while concentrating on 33 Down in National Enquirer's weekly crossword puzzle.   The main character, never named by the author, takes us along on her daily travails that involve such hardships as agonizing whether to turn down a flight on a private jet with a married man or fly commercial, considering whether to become friends with a woman who wears last-season's Manolos, and debating whether it would be really wrong to sleep with her best friend's boyfriend multiple times since she already slept with him once.   The sad thing is for a book that chronicles the lives of young, New York socialites who have everything and want much more, it doesn't offer its readers much of anything. The plot never thickens. The characters never take on dimension. We just end up following no name around to her parties, showers, waxing appointments, shopping expeditions, and boyfriends' bedrooms (hers or someone else's). While some might consider the ride fun and the vernacular (totally beyond, moi, tres chic, etc.) cute, most readers will tire of it by the end of the first chapter.   The only thing the book offers of any value is an insight into a twisted subculture of totally selfabsorbed, impossibly superficial, anorexia-endorsing ninnies who make us feel much better about springing for that new pair of shoelaces when we just could have laundered the old ones 
 I don't know if I was more disappointed or angered at this little insignificant but dangerous book.  The contents has very little to do with what children, who travel to Italy, will ever encounter.  What I find it does is continue the negative strereotyping of the Italians.  Really! No one stomps on grapes and a child who will visit a farm in Italy will hardly see such outdated stereotypical occurrences.  Can food be the only thing one would like of Italy? Of course, since the book failed to explain what other things of wonder a child might see.  I bought this for my grandchildren, as sadly there are very few book on Italy with some italian words.  I returned the book because I would NEVER introduce Italy to my grandchildren this way.  A very expensive book that perpatuates outdated images.  Poor job.  
 This book is pretty much worthless if you are looking for any sort of detailed technical content or information regarding to RFID applications and 'how it works'.  If you are looking for a few 'cookbook' projects to try out then this is kind of good for that, but still not overly impressive.  The author is definitely not an engineer and is just an amature trying to spread some vague information about an technology subject that is much more complicated than is explained in this book.  Buying this book is not a wise of money, in my opinion 
 manual and I cannot find that it supports SACD 
 BLOOD MERIDIAN is a novella or long short story streched out to make a 335-page novel. There is basically little if any plot. While Cormac McCarthy can write poetically, writing poetically about nothing is still nothing. It's like a million times zero is still zero. Most of the book is just one murder, slaughter, killing, massacre, beating, stabbing, shooting, scalping after another. It is an unrelentingly dark and depressing view of a time and place in history (Mexico and the southwest in the 19th century) without any redeeming happiness or hope. You cannot read this book from end to end without becoming depressed yourself. While I admire Mr. McCarthy's writing (see my wildly favorable review of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), BLOOD MERIDIAN is not worth your time or the fourteen dollars the book costs. Don't contaminate your mind with this jumped-up short story 
 I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.  Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.  I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well 
 For a biginner to intermediate triathlete looking for information, this is not the"book".  It's a glorified blank logbook.  The author even states that much of the needed information is in almanac -3 which you can purchase separatel 
 The product was, as advertised, easy to install and has worked continuously for more than two months since I installed it.  So far, it does not appear to have affected the mole population, however. To be fair, it is possible that my sandy soil is not the ideal medium for this device (instructions indicate that it works best in heavy claylike soil, although the critters have dug quite close to it).  To be really bend-over-backwards fair, I suppose it is possible that my problem is not moles, although the telltale signs are exactly what I understand mole tunnels to look like.   
 I received the wrong item, a videotape and emailed the address of the company that didn't send the book I ordered, but they didn't reply to my email. I tried to email Amazon about it, but ran into snags: your system wasn't working, etc. I finally had to take the book out of a college library, since it is out of print 
 Hamilton beach has ruined an expellant product the `TrueAir Cool Mist Humidifier' by making the replacement filters so badly.  A big disappointment, the filter gets moldy after a month of usage making the operation very expensive. I hope they come up with a better solution.  I dont know what happend but the the latest filter has last all winter and still looks new. 
 I have a Panasonic microwave that's worked perfectly for years. The first trial of this popper produced good popcorn but a funny smell came out of my microwave. Now the microwave can't even heat water.  Pretty upsetting... to be out over $100 now. No warning on the box about Panasonic microwave ovens 
 I agree with M. Arse with the 2star rating. I was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. Not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. I'm interested in the 7 Mp camera Canon offers. I've read that it has much better shutter speed. Recommended?? 
 This book looks like it is a compilations from older black and white photographs with a few newer color photographs.  While the stitches look interesting and many are clear and easy to see, too many of them are colorized from black and white photographs. Most importantly, these original photographs were not clear to begin with, so the colorizing obscures them further. 
 Although his interesting childhood kept you glued to the first quarter of the book, the rest is just a basic cowboy's life written with little or no techniques to keep you compelled to read every word. It is interesting to read, however, since he was a true to life cowboy. If I had to do over, I'd saved my money. 
 Sister of My Heart is one of my all time favorite books--I love everything about that book and that is why I was so excited to discover the Divakaruni wrote a sequet to it. But after reading it I wish I had not. Yes, it was nice to have so many of the questions, left over from the first book, answered but this book ruined the characters for me.  My review of it has nothing against Divakaruni as a writer, she is extremely talented and gifted but I hate where the story ended up. I also hated that I no longer cared for the characters. Overall I found it to be just ordinary and almost forced.  As far as this book is concerned I would have liked to be left in the dark 
 If you buy this book thinking that you are going to get the sort of insight into medical conditions that you would get from Oliver Sacks, you are going to be massively dissapointed. This book is best characterized as a thin and cursory catalog of some of the more unusual medical conditions around. As such, I guess it has a place, but there is little in it that merits the time to read it. I was left wondering how she found a publisher to print it 
 The first use wasn't too bad. It cut things well but the lock locks too easily, without something even touching it, so it had to be unlocked multiple times during use. Safety is nice,but that is just annoying.  The biggest problem is the coil/spring is NOT stainless-steel so the inside of it rusts, even if you take it apart for each washing. Once it gets rusty it becomes very very difficult toclose the shears, making cutting a real pain, literally. I soak the spring regularly in rust remover but I can not use it no more than a single piece now without horrible aches in my hand.  My prior shears lasted for 10 years, but these I need to replace after a couple of months.. 
 I read the promising reviews and found the story's premise interesting, but what a let down. I eagerly read the first few chapters and then discovered that the author really didn't have much more to say. Oh, he kept building his characters into what should have become some sort of crescendo, but sadly there was none, and the plot simply fizzled out and died. On the last twenty pages or so, I found myself skipping over whole paragraphs in a vain search for something interesting to happen. I couldn't wait for the main character to die so I could finally understand the ultimate reality the author, no doubt, was going to reveal in the end. It seems the author simply got tired of rambling on about the characters and decided to hastily bail out 
 I had high hopes for this.  After spending $24.95 to buy it, and watching the first disc, I don't even feel inspired to watch the other discs.  I am an alcoholic myself, and have been sober (thanks to AA) for 11 plus years.  I work in the medical field, and am exposed to addicts of every stripe on a daily basis.  I found the ballyhoo surrounding the release of this confusing.  Perhaps it just shows the hunger of the American people to learn SOMETHING, ANYTHING about the subject of addiction.  It IS a complex subject, and I didn't find any answers here.    I'm not sure exactly what the purpose of the show was.  If it was strictly to educate, I found it to be an extremely non-cohesive hodgepodge of information that DID'T include some of the most important ideas about addiction.  It was like a puzzle that all lay strewn about on the table so that you couldn't figure out what picture it was supposed to be - and with some of the pieces missing, to boot!  If it was to inspire addicts or their families to get treatment for their addiction, I didn't feel in the least bit inspired.  I did not leave the show with an uplifting feeling, or even a scared-and-need-to-do-something-about-it feeling.  I left the show vaguely confused, not much liking or caring about either the addict subjects or any of the researchers.  There were exceptions, of course.  I enjoyed the Night in the ED segment, and I found the Steamfitters to be very "real" and human.  Addiction IS a terrible disease, and it deserves better treatment than this.     Probably the main thing that I did NOT like was that the whole show seemed slanted towards "magic bullet" thinking, which does a disservice to the addict.  That is, over and over are mentioned "exciting new medicines" and "getting the right medicines and the right treatment to help the addict", which I find dangerous and misleading.  That is, it leads one to feel that the solution to addiction is just getting hold of one of the new "miracle" drugs touted.  Perhaps the show was funded by the pharmaceutical industry.  "Miracle drugs" which will solve an addicts problem nearly effortlessly and painlessly have continually popped up over the years (antabuse and SSRI antidepressants come to mind), and none have a very impressive track record.  In fairness to the show, they do mention some of this, but it seems buried in the more frequently talked about glamour of the next "miracle drug".  I was particularly amazed that amongst all of the brain scans, scientific speculation, and such, that there was NO mention whatsoever of any 12 step program, or any proven treatment center such as Hazeldon or the Betty Ford clinic.  Because the reality is, while these scientists are busy engineering the next ever more detailed brain scan machine, there are real humans out there in the world who are SUCCESSFULLY HELPING THEIR FELLOW HUMANS TO GET CLEAN AND SOBER.  What a concept!  And without miracle drugs even!  Getting clean and sober is not easy, and it does a disservice to addicts everywhere to a) give voice to the magical idea that some miracle cure is going to solve everything, and b) not to mention real life programs available now (often free) that have proven track records, and offer REAL hope.    If you like science, be aware that Alcoholics Anonymous has been shown SCIENTIFICALLY in study after study to have THE SINGLE BEST TRACK RECORD AT KEEPING ALCOHOLICS SOBER.  Is it for everyone?  No, but if you want to get (and more importantly STAY) sober, the odds are better with AA as a follow-up (after initial treatment) than with anything else that you can name.  "It works if you work it" as they say in AA.  I have no direct experience with other 12 step programs, and so can't comment, but I know that they operate very similarly.  WHY on a show about addiction would they not mention any 12 step program?  I sat with my jaw hanging down as I watched the entire show, and AA was only mentioned twice:  once by a woman early in the show who had been sober for 17 years or something "through AA", (that in itself is an amazing accomplishment, and should say all you need to know about AA), and later in the show on the Steamfitters  who formed their own support group basically because they felt that going to AA would be somehow 'wimpy' for manly men like them.  I don't where they got that impression, because I've never heard of AA being called 'wimpy' (or whatever term they used).  AA's full of bikers, construction workers, etc., right alongside the doctors and lawyers.  That's the beauty of it: it recognizes that addiction knows no boundaries, and shows what we addicts have IN COMMON.  The irony of the steamfitters is that the little group they formed is ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE AN AA GROUP AND MEETING!  I was laughing - there was almost no difference.  So if you want to know what an AA meeting is like, watch the steamfitters.  The sense of caring about their fellow man who is an addict like them came from the deepest depths of human caring and no-nonsense facing the facts.  And the power of "it takes one to know one" that lets them get their fellows to let down their barriers and listen is exactly why AA is so effective.  Who wants to listen to a scientist?  If you're an addict or an alcoholic, you want to listen to another addict or alcoholic.  They've walked a mile in your shoes.  So to me the show was a moderately boring stream of blah, blah, blah with little real inspirational meat or insight.  If you want some real scientific insight into how this "brain disease" works (at least the alcoholic version), try the book "Beyond the Influence", available from Amazon.  Good meat there.  If you want to see some good talk from people who have (to me) better insight into the whole addiction thing, search online for the Larry King Live addiction show which featured Jamie Lee Curtis and Betty Ford's daughter from the Betty Ford clinic.  Transcripts are available online.  It was an incredible show.  Coincidentally, one of the "researchers" who appears on the HBO special was also on the Larry King show, and it was slightly embarrassing to watch his miracle drug theoretical approach to the subject next to those who are actually down in the trenches with addicts on a human level.  You will see what I'm talking about.    
 The suspicious side of me wants to believe that HP did a promo with their Deskjet 612C - i.e. they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements.  I would be surprised if there is any difference between the 612C black replacement cartridge C6614 and the much more common cartridge for the 660C other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case 
 This is the third installment in the Mitch Rapp series and the author's fourth book overall. (I'd suggest reading the previous books both for chronology reasons and that they're better reads.) Mitch is America's #1 "go to" guy when it comes to fighting terrorism. In "Separation of Power" he is faced with cleaning up some open issues from his last mission (someone tried to kill him), the political "in-fighting" surrounding the naming of a new CIA chief, rogue Mossad agents, Iraq gaining nuclear weapons and falling in love. One could be forgiven in thinking this last issue would make for a pleasant diversion while our hero prevents WW III. Not so. Mitch's romance takes a front and center position and in a word is well ... comedic. The "action" threads of the plot - which this author has worked so well in his previous books - is hinted at in the first 100 pages, doesn't really begin until after 200 pages - and then proceeds in fits and starts. There is an inordinate amount of "character development" - self-serving, amoral, scheming politicans & our world weary, battle scarred reluctant hero Mitch, who must once again pick up the sword to do what no other man can do - which like the "romance" impedes the plot. The book hastily concludes, (20+ pages), in an unsatisfying and simplistic finale. Hopefully this book is an anomaly in the series because the author's previous books were great roller coaster rides and provided entertaining reading at the beach and in airports. Unfortunately the much rushed conclusion and Mitch's "new" situation doesn't guarantee that.   
 I honestly can't review the whole CD because I have only heard Step Up.  It was on the The Late Show with Jay Leno.... I whole song was terrible.  The dancing was awful.  I am not a pop fan by anymeans but this was a joke.  In fact I thought this was a joke - a play off of The Pussy Cat Dolls - until I realized that this is a "real legitement" band....  This does nothing but deteriorate the music scene as a whole.  It floods the market with crap.  yuck - no thank you, even the teenie boppers could find something better to listen to 
 I read a favorable review of this book so I got it.  I have been reading obits for a good while and they are a great delight. I thought this book would aid me somehow in this pursuit,  but it did not.  All it did was to puff up  the professional obit writers, about how interesting they are, unappreciated , etc.  I guess I should have gotten a book of actual interesting obits instead. If the author could have cut the book down to 20 pages, it would have been enough.  My advice to people who are interested in obits,....  is to read obits.   
 I was incredibly disappointed in this cookbook.  A large number of the recipes seem to be more about proving the varity of foods you CAN cook in the slow cooker, rather than foods it is USEFUL to cook in the slow cooker. Keep in mind that unless you're looking to soften tough meat, you can make almost any slow cooker recipe on the stove if you have an hour or two to babysit it.  Slow cooker recipes that require a lot of babysitting (adding ingredients, stirring, or doing something else in the middle of the cook time) run four to six hours and require you to hang around the house all that time.  I'm a working foodie who uses the slow cooker to make fun, interesting meals that I can leave to cook during the work day.  Between the babysitting required and the less-than-8-hour cook times, I was very disappointed in the number of recipes from this book I could use at all.  I highly recommend Judith Finlayson's books for a better alternative 
 I have the Proper Care and Feeding of husbands and I enjoyed that book.  Woman Power is full of blank pages for you to write your thoughts and ideas. I think it is a waste of time unless you just LOVE to journal.  If you took the useful information and took out the blank pages the book is about 2 chapters.  My advice is to put your money to better use at Victorias Secret.  Your husband will get a lot more out of it!! 
 The costumes were great....but this movie did no justice to the novel.  "Cousin Bette" the novel is excellent , "Cousin Bette" the movie, is dreadful.  I understand some changes are necessary when a novel is adapted into a movie, but these changes were awful and they took something very important (the Baroness) away from the story...  If you haven't read the novel, you will probably find this movie to be decent.  If you have read the novel, be prepared to be very disappointed 
 As someone who believes in the superiority of bioidentical hormones to oral PremPro, I was disappointed that this book was not able to make its case more convincingly.  It is very poorly argued and referenced-- if you actually check the references, you will find many of them to have little to do with the point being made.  Also, the authors criticize the medical establishment for leaping to the conclusion that all estrogen is evil-- but then they leap to many conclusions of their own.  The hypothesis of this book is intriguing-- that it's not estrogen per se that causes breast cancer, it's low-level estrogen without the proper peaking and cycling of estrogen and progesterone.  This hypothesis deserves to be properly addressed by a scientifically rigorous author.  If you have enough scientific training to be able to separate the baby from the bathwater, then I would say go ahead and read this book-- it will stimulate a lot of thinking.  But if you don't have scientific training, be aware that this is only a theory-- an intriguing theory, but still just a theory.  Many of the references in the back are duplicates or not really relevant.  Also, be aware that if you look around on the Internet you will find a group of people who have stopped using the doses recommended in this book because they found them to be way too high-- and one of the collaborators on the book says that he does not endorse the dosage levels in the book.  For more details, I recommend reading the previous review "There are pearls in the muck" and poking around a little on the Web.  Let's hope for a more scientifically rigorous book about this subject in the near future 
 I saw this book when I was a child and wanted to read it then (it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp/airship on it).  Unfortunatley, life intervened and I only got around to reading it just recently.  Alas!  This book was a lot better and more wonder-filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be.  The story is not very interesting, the setting is not well-painted, the protagonist's adventures are pedestrian, and the whole thing is swiss-cheesed with so much British slang as will likely put an American kid off his feed.  Skip this one 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 I think this books target audience is young teenagers as no serious person would bother.  I found the book witless and tasteless.  Almost all the jokes are from his popular website and forum which is a parody of redneck fundamentalist Evangelical Christianity.  The real motive is not humor but rather a low blow at Christianity by misquoting the Bible and trying to confuse the readers.  If a Christian were to write a book mocking other peoples ideologies the author would be shot down in flames in the name of the almighty "political correctness".  But if someone mocks Christianity it is considered 'religious tolerance'.  So go ahead, buy this book, have a good laugh at the expense of Christians.  They are the only ones who will turn the other cheek.  As for me, personally I would not recommend this book  to any serious reader and I have already used its pages as liner for my parrot cage. 
 Words cannot describe how ripped off and disappointed I feel about buying this book.   Having read RDPD and CFQ in the Kiyosaki range previously and finding them great, I thought this book would be great as well. I'm sorry to say it's the worst book I've ever read. The entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books.   There's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more, you need to buy one of his other books. I didn't get any useful information and it's certainly not a 'how to' book. I thought I would be reading about him and his wife's story but all I got was the same few points said over and over again. He doesn't even try to say them in a different way.  The other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option. It was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members.   I could seriously go on and on about why you shouldn't waste your money on this book but I won't.  I have NEVER written a book review on amazon before as I have never felt so strongly about a book. I generally feel if I get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it. In this case I didn't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why I decided to post this review.   I hope it saves someone else from wasting their money. Buying this book WILL NOT HELP YOU RETIRE YOUNG OR RETIRE RICH 
 This device has lots of problems.  The customer support was not very good either.  We had difficulty setting up the wifi access when we got it.  Customer support provided no help at all.  We finally figured it out on our own.  The software constantly freezes, often requiring rebooting.  The last straw was today when all of the applications disappeared from the desktop.  We'll take our refund and purchase a laptop 
 This book does a good job explaining the relationship between broker and client, property characteristics and some other subjects.  However, the book does a poor job explaining the ins and outs of financing from the different programs to how exactly points with a mortgage broker work.  I just recently purchased a house and this was to be my sole reference, however, I had to seek out answers on the Internet for most of my financing questions.  Several times during this book the author explains that in order to have a more in depth explanation about a particular subject, you need to purchase his book on "negotiating", or "financing" .  The book also was inaccurate and spoke negatively about government financing programs such as FHA/HUD loans and VA loans.  I used VA financing for my purchase and the explanation and details in the book were inadequate.  If you purchase this book, do not expect it to answer the majority of your questions 
 As a Will Ferrell fan I will go easy.  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Had I seen this in the theaters I would have demanded my money back. 
 Clear And Present Danger is OK at points, but the rest of the novel is boring with the CIA work, the action between the Commandos don't feel realistic, the story drags on on for hundreds of pages, the boring details of how big a ship is, that is boring! If you want to read a REAL and exciting novel, read Bob Mayer's Eyes Of The Hammer. Bib Mayer is a former Special Forces officer, the action is there, and is VERY EXCITING unlike this book where you have to go through hundreds of pages to get to the action. 
 I love reading about this time period, so I thought I'd really love this book. But I didn't. It was poorly written on three major ways.   1. He was wishy-washy. He couldn't take a stand on the facts he researched. He would say, it isn't clearly documented, or some research said this, some said that, etc. And he annoyingly kept interupting himself to state this! Made me feel that he did some research, but couldn't figure it out. I've read other authors who write about history that can take the facts and distill them into a clear viewpoint. So what if others refute it, take a stand, have an opionion!   2. He kept flip-flopping by referring to the characters by their first name then their last. Pick one and be consistent!   3. It was very disjointedly written. Another reviewer mentioned that he'd start talking about something, then in the next paragraph talk about something else totally unrelated. I kept looking for some kind of organization to the whole thing, but never found it.  If you want to read some good books about this time period - written by a better author, but historical FICTION, read Dorothy Dunnet's House of Niccolo Series. Now THAT's how the Renaissance should be written 
 The "filler" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from "Rebel Heart" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all! 
  Their main arguments for US withdrawal, are that it will be cheaper and "of course", it was wrong for the US to invade and occupy in the first place.  In Polk's analyses of guerilla wars against occupations, there is, "of course", always also violence between competing groups among those occupied and there will also likely be a struggle and violence after the occupiers leave, but this will eventually die down.  Polk and McGovern argue that "that is the Iraqi way" as a defense to allowing sectarian military forces as part of the the withdrawal from Iraq.  These forces will provide some security in the areas they belong and will be problematic when they roam outside their areas, of course.    Polk and McGovern recommend that the US compensate Iraqi victims for property damage, reconstruction and cleanup, and make "condolence" payments for the killed and wounded.  They argue that withdrawal will still be much cheaper than the war, even with these payments.  Salmon Rushdie says "There has been on the left for a long time, this view that--third world good, first world oppressive and bad...Third worldism, has lead to some very strange intellectual mistakes, part of which is a kind of infantialization of people, that they don't know any better...There is also the collossal mistake of cultural relativism which is the [...] child of multi-culturalism...things are OK if they are your culture, if your culture happens to include stoning adulteresses to death, then, hey, it's your culture, if it includes female circumcision, which of us can argue with that...it doesn't stand up, cultural relativism,  what it does is absolves us as individuals and groups from making any moral choices, ... at that point you genuinely arrive at what's called decadence, when you lose the ability to decide as individuals, groups and a society...to argue about, and sometimes to agree about what is right and what is wrong."  By Rushdie's definition, this book is decadent when it argues for the hegelian/fascist notion of the rights of nations to oppress their own people.  It doesn't argue for fascism by name, of course, but it is a morally bankrupt book, which argues that the occupying force, which deposed a dictator and is trying to nurse a democracy, is reponsible for the attacks on innocent civilians, the sectarian violence and the chaos.  The corrollary of course, is that the insurgents, terrorists and sectarians are not personally responsible for their choices and actions, they are irrational forces acting in a perfectly natural and defensible way. As, Rushdie would say, they have been "infantilized".  In McGovern and Polk's view, the United States is responsible not only for its actions, but for the actions that those they oppose committed.  If you believe in the right of sovereign nations to oppress "their own people" and woe be to anyone who comes to the aid of those people believing those people are capable of civil democratic society, then you will like this book.  These opinions are my own, but I did find this book exemplary of the cultural relativism that Salmon Rushdie so succinctly characterized 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 In 5th grade my reading group was assigned this book. We all hated it because Gilly was an obnoxious, snotty brat. We spent most of our work time drawing comics in which she crawled out of the school toilets and attacked us, and we had to fight back and defeat the evil Gilly. So if you want your kids to waste time, buy this book; if you actually want them to read something meaningful and enjoyable, look elsewhere.  However, I do have to say that we weren't at all shocked or corrupted by the language. Kids learn that stuff anyway 
 I personally really didn't enjoy this book. It was a waste of my time. Who really cares about his life. My teacher assigned the book and i was forced to read it. It was pain. I think he could of made it more interesting but unfortunately he had a very dull life. My teacher compared this book to Boy and in my mind there is no comparison. BOY was great book and Knots in my yo yo string was definatly not. I enjoyed reading boy but HATED reading knots in my Yo Yo string. IF you want to read a book i would definately recommend Boy and not Knots in my yo yo string. Thank you for your tim 
 This book is terrible. He is 1 of the worst players in the MLB!!!!!  In the  home run derby he corked his bat and they found out!!!!  and then they let him use that bat they r stupid!!!!!!!!!!   They should have kicked him out of the MLB for life!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
 Repetitive, boring, but sometimes effective. This set of CDs skirts around essentials, offerring too little to stand on its own as an introduction to Italian 
 Ohhgawd avoid this crapola like poison.  This is neither a scholastically researched, nor an academically-sound nor a first-person-adventure account of this important topic.  This is a VERY serious topic deserving of far better treatment than this book has given it.  OK, its better than the other book on this topic ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' (Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke) but not much.  Save yourself the dough.  The fact that there is a dearth of good books on this topic does not mean you should squander your hard-earned money this way.  This is on the same level as most other books on Nazi Flying Saucers.  Strictly supermarket check-out counter level gutter hacko-journo-workmanship.  The publication equivalent of plumbing works. 
 Please don't buy this if you think you are going to be juicing carrots and apples and other hard vegetables. Because it is manual, it would take anyone forever to get a 12 oz. glass of carrot juice. I can get a glass of carrot juice in less than 1 minute with my centrifugal juicer which is a Juiceman pro. But, a centrifugal juicer can't do what this little juicer can do, juice grass and leafy greens.   I have mixed feelings about this little juicer.  First the pros. This juicer does a fine job of juicing wheatgrass. The pulp is dry and it is not hard to crank. Cleanup is fairly easy. It is portable. It is cheap. You get a slick dvd and extra parts. In an emergency this juicer would be an ideal survivor tool.   Now the cons. The so called indestructible plastic auger cracked after the first two weeks of juicing wheatgrass. I have to send it back for a replacement. Sometimes the crank hits the clamp or the edge of the counter. That means I have to readjust the clamp to make sure it is on correctly. Not a big problem but something you have to be careful about. If the lip on your kitchen counter does not protrude out far enough, the clamp might not attach properly. We actually have to open the dishwasher in order to have enough clearance for the clamp to attach under the kitchen counter. I ended up juicing in my backyard attaching the unit to the side table of my grill because of the clamp, the clearances and the drippy mess.  Next, the designers decided it would be best to reverse the threads of the end cap. That means in order to tighten it, you turn it counter clockwise. This is the opposite of every standard thread on the planet. It's confusing. In order to take off the end cap after juicing, you have to use the wrench supplied and use a moderate amount of force. I don't like it.  Also, the hopper body is hard to slide off the locking base. Sometimes I really have to push it. Next, the juice cup is very close to the handle crank. You have to be careful not to knock over the juice cup as you are cranking. Not a huge deal but again, something you have to put up with.  Lastly, when you slide off the hopper, there are some drips. Because you must attach the locking base close to the edge of a counter, that means some drips on the kitchen floor. It can get messy.  I bought an Omega 8005 electric juicer three weeks after buying this healthy juicer. The omega is terrific and has none of the problems I have with the healthy juicer. 
 I would be very wary of the positive reviews on this product.  I find it hard to believe that such a piece of garbage could be thought of so highly.  First off, you must hold the top down to get the item being laminated through the machine.  This would be a minor inconvenience if this was the only problem.  The really bad news is that the laminate bubbles horribly, and it is hazy rather than clear.  How anyone would use this for photos is beyond me.  Next, the magnetic backing doesn't stick at all to whatever your laminating. It just falls right off.  There is absolutely nothing worthwhile about this piece of junk.  I bought this based on the reviews of the others here.  Shame on them for misleading people in this way.  If you want to use this as an arts and crafts type of toy for pre-kindergarteners, maybe.  For serious use, never.  Spend the extra money and get a quality heat laminating machine 
 I agree with the other reviewers; this book is full of factual errors, typos and grammatical problems, and cheap pseudo-psychoanalysis. Stewart deserves better than this hack, and I'm sorry I bought the book 
 This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?   
 Perhaps the larger model works well. This smaller magnetic set is tragic. The only upside is that if you're working on your grip strength, these will probably help. To get a useable amount of pepper, you'll have to squeeze 15-20 times. They feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can. Stick with a tried and true twist grinder. 
 Is it true that the lead singer for Hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated? His voice sounds so. The way he sings "Lips of an Angel" makes me want to punch him in the face! I'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group. I seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before I heard the chorus!  
 No talent. Who gave them another record deal after this album and actually let them remake "am I dreaming"? Absolutely terrible. Not trying to hate but it's pretty bad. Save your money. 
 i've been reading the reviews for this book, and I wanted to offer up my own opinion.  I first read this book as part of my high school 11th grade english cirriculum.  And as a warning to others, I just wanted to say that reading this book was like watching paint dry.  There is no structure, and after a while it seems like your just reading page after page but are retaining nothing.  Though there are some very interesting funny parts in the books, the overall dullness of it all overpowers the good.  At some points, I wanted to claw my eyes out in despair.   I admit, I do love Mark Tawin, but this is in Noo sense, his best work.   Ones again, this is just my opinion.  Read it and see for yourself 
 The basis of this book is that consciousness can be explained as a Bose-Einstein condensate of atoms in the neurons.  Interesting idea, sadly impossible.  Bose-Einstein condensates can only exist at very low temperatures.  The inside of the brain certainly doesn't qualify.  The authors could've easily established the impossibility of their claim by looking up B-E condensates in any textbook on statistical mechanics 
 I recommend reading this book, and follow along with Webster Tarpley's 911 Synthetic Terror Made in the USA. Also David Ray Griffins "A New Pearl Harbor". By the end of this exercise if you still believe the official myth put forth by this tome of lies, deceit and treason you should seek professional help.   Seriously this is not only wrong on nearly every relevant fact (Purposely), but purposefully ignores all the facts that could distract from the official MYTH that they were appointed to propagate.   Good job Keane! Great Whitewash! You'll go down in history as presiding over one of the biggest packs of lies ever created to cover up mass murder. What does this make you? 
 A terrible product. Extremely difficult to use. Way too easy to accidentally change the combination, and when that happens, it's useless. The only reason it gets one star is that the rating system does not allow a zero or a negaive number. Don't waste your money on this product 
 The is a review of a pharmacy student. Unfortunately, this is a required text for my medchem/pharmacology class. You can ask any student in my class and majority of us would have the same complaint. This book is extremely difficult to follow. For example they give you a table for alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. While the table is more or less OK describing different beta receptor types, it doesn't tell much about alpha receptors. The authors of this omit a lot of important details.  They don't write much about medications' side effects. In general this book makes it difficult to distinguish medications of each group from each other. On the better side, the book provides a lot of chemical structures, which make medchem part easier 
 As long as its on, it will prevent scratches, but its tough to get off, and that act can scratch your laptop.  It scratched my Macbook when I pried it off.  The guy at the Apple Store who snapped it on a Macbook beause I requested a "demo", couldn't pry it off, and after 10 embarassing minutes, he called a colleague over, and they pried it off together.  And, to be honest, this makes the MB look ugly - kinda like putting a veil on a supermodel.  ;-- 
 No mute button?  Isn't that illegal?  How about having to drill down menu after menu to just to turn off the ringer?  Otherwise the phone works great and sounds great.  But these are biggies to me 
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 this movie is one of the 3 ~worst~ movies I've ever seen. these 98 minutes seemed more like 6 hours.  and for chrissake - he's NOT an american 
 Even though I am a fan of the Calphalon cutlery line (I really think they beat the pants off of the German competition), this block leaves a lot to be desired. The block that came with my 15 piece set was pretty nice, and I ordered this block to house the additional knives that I bought. It appears to be the same design, but the quality control is awfull. Several glue joints were split open when I recieved the block, and the finish was not quite up to par. Given the low cost, I chose to glue and clamp the block into submission, rather than to send it back, but you  might be better off buying a more expensive block to start with 
 Wow - all these raves! There isn't room on the net for all the stars something really well-written and original would get. This book is just plain mediocre  -  I could barely make it through to the halfway point. On the upside: great titl 
 while some of the tracks that should have words do, others don't.  The outer limits doesn't have "we control the horizontal.." and the A-team doesn't have the proper intro.  Monty Python is also a midi remake of the orginal that doesn't have the cheep tinny sound that it should 
 starts off as Spacey's moons the cameras and people and then goes on with a boring pace and the worst part is that Colin Farrell has little screen time in this one and gets killed as hes shooting from behind a painting, what the hell. Fiorento has a good British accent but the story is to dumb and Spacey's friends and the cops are obnoxious, but Farrell was mute maybe for most his part. for Spacey or Farrell fan 
 Now, the first album is a bonafide classic. Black Mafia Life too. I still havent heard Uncle Sams Curse yet but should anyday and if Black Superman is any indication its gonna bang BUT... And thats a [...]. This album is just too lazy. Beats that might sound dope if you high in a stupor but boring otherwise, and lyrics you cant be bothered to listen to. Partly cos of the beats but the overall generic blandness just washes over you. Sorry ATL. I love ya but this one [...] 
 When someone indites the 'Theory of Evolution' as a theory not a fact, it makes it sound as if theories and facts are opposite things, as if we are really sure of facts and not so sure of theories. In science theory is a higher level of understanding then facts, because what theories do is explain the facts by uniting them. Theory is a system of explanations that elucidate the observable facts of nature.  This book is a failure of the human desire for scientific understanding: it's been peer reviewed and the response is unanimously negative. Don't waist your time with this waist of paper 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 After having read the book, I was left with a mixed feeling. The content of the book is OK. Not special, just OK. If this book changed your way of thinking about risk, then this is probably one of your first books you read on the subject. I give the book content 4 stars, since it's decent, easy to follow and fairly complete. Besides that, the author included three good articles at the end of the book, one of which (by Caroline Hamilton) is particularly well-written.  Now for the style. I can only agree with one of the other reviewers regarding the comment he made about proofreading the book. I wonder if the book was proofread at all. There are so many errors and annoyances in this book, it starts working on my nerves fairly quickly. To name but a few:   The writer contradicts himself on several occasions. Sometimes this gets hilarious: - Page 30: [The cost/benefit analysis] is the most important step of any risk analysis process. - Page 35: As discussed in the previous example, the scope statement is the most important element of the risk analysis process. - Page 39: The most important element of any risk analysis process is the recommendations of controls and safeguards... etc etc.   I understand that mister O'Leary is his mentor, but don't tell me five $%^$@ times that he is the Director of the Education Resource Center (pages ix, 12, 13, 65, 66).   The spelling errors are a real pain in the butt:  - page 217: "Aurebach" instead of "Auerbach" (my favorite; it's his own publisher). - page 16: "can shared" instead of "can be shared" - page 36: ".appropriate" instead of "appropriate" - page 43: "their role" instead of "his role" - page 45: "control" instead of "risk" (last word on the page) - page 46: "these" instead of "there" - page 47: "guideline" instead of "guidelines" - page 55: "their" instead of "its" (it refers back to "job") - page 64: wrong comma usage - page 71: "in" instead of "it" - ..... - page 162: "Originizational" instead of "Organizational" - page 217: "Ozierz's" instead of "Ozier's"   The writer uses the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V too many times. Definitions should be reworded, not blindly copied. See pages 7 and 57, pages 47 and 72 etc.  Sometimes bulleted items in the same list have a trailing dot, sometimes they haven't.  I can go on and on.  To wrap it up, the writing gets 1 star. Equals 5 stars. Which will be rounded to 2 stars, simply because of his sloppy writing. If the writing were better, I might give it 3 or 4 stars 
 This was a present to myself for my birthday.  I thought I was purchasing a quality product.  Two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working.  I took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again.  I sent it back for a refund and not very happy I have to pay a restock fee for a defective item.  I will be rethinking future purchases... 
 I am an avid reader and could not make it through this book. His other books were so good. I could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be. In applying some of the recommended techniques, my 11 year old daughter, Emily, thought I lost my mind. Thank goodness things are back to normal. We are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice 
  This is the most misleading of books. The title would have you believe Gouverneur Morris wrote the Constitution. A few more founding Fathers naturally participated. However, Morris was Chairman of the Committee on Style which means Morris was primarily responsible for making printed sense out of the legal mumbo jumbo. He did this and did it well to include the Preamble, no mean feat. But he certainly did not write the Constitution as Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. Nor did Morris himself ever claim to. If Morris did write the Constitution, as Richard Brookheiser claims in the title, why did Brookheiser spend less that 10% of the book reporting on what this work is purportedly all about, the Constitution and Morris' participation therein?  Aside from being misleading, this book just also happens to be very poorly written. It is cluttered and confusing. It is a shame the author does not give the reader a better opportunity to know Morris. Morris lived and participated in some of the Nation's most formative times. If the author had given his subject more attention, if he had said more about who Morris was and how he interacted with the events of his time, then this could have been a slam bang winner, a blockbuster of a fine work. Instead, the best thing that can be said is that it is a very cursory survey of the times in which Morris lived.   Mercifully, it is short. 
 I thought the plot, storyline and the key characters were interesting. But what turned me off completely was the Jesus and God references. After what I felt was one too many, I gave up.  This is definitely my first and last Brockman novel 
 I'll keep this review short and sweet.  This book is an in-depth academic discussion of how humans see and perceive things.  Although there were some interesting tid-bits throughout the book, I wanted to learn how to improve the composition of my photographs, and didn't find anything of use.  This book is probably well-suited to a graduate-level psychology course, but for me it has little applicability to photography 
 We've owned this toaster for 2 years now.  Because it's lasted that long and due to it's appealing looks, we give it the 2 stars.  As for using it for toasting, it rates very poorly.  The toast darkness control is unreliable.  Leave it in one place and get light toast at one time and dark the next.  It has a silly mechanism that supposedly allows for better control when toasting bagels or muffins.  The control is useless.  The worst part of the machine, however, is that it is nearly impossible to retrieve the toast, bagel, whatever, without getting burned.  More than once we've been forced to turn the toaster upside down to get our breakfast (toast and millions of crumbs).  Buy it for it's looks, look elsewhere for making toast.  
 be prepared that most of (but not all of) the stories are fantasy (made up lands and places or dream, etc), and not realistic....probably a lovely collection if that's what you're looking for.  also, mine was bound up-side-down and backwards....anyone elses?? 
 I just finished reading this book, and the one that follows it: The Cat who Dropped a Bombshell.  Both of them are disappointing and not worth reading. And I now realize what the problem is. Dear Lilian is not writing these books anymore. She's either deceased or retired. Someone else is writing them. A person who doesn't have a clue as to how to spin a good mystery story. All through this book I kept waiting for the mystery to be presented, worked on, spun out and then solved. But it never happened. The book was boring with all its details and run-on commentary about things going on in the town. The step-son is presented and disappears, murders are hinted at but never resolved, the "guilty party" is discovered at the end, but dismissed with a shrug. Mysterious circumstances are presented and then dropped. What's the point? If the publishers want to continue this series, then they have to find a new writer who has some mystery writing experience, who can follow in Ms. Braun's footsteps, and continue the series with style 
 I read this book just coming out of high school, 8 years or so ago.  At the time, I subscribed to Harris's dating philosophy.  Having just come out of a few defunct relationships, this book provided the answer that I was looking for: our commitment-phobic dating culture is the problem.  The solution: pursue relationships in an extreme, counter-culture fashion.    Now that I'm older, married, and a little wiser, I see this book for what it is:  a knee-jerk reaction that is a reflection on Harris's inexperience and immaturity at the time.  Having come out of a few bad relationships himself, he identified what he thought was the problem (the commitment-phobic dating culture), and scoured the Bible for "proof-texts" that coincided with his solution for the problem, like any good evangelical would do.    Why not to follow the relationship advice this book prescribes?  Well, I'm sure for many people it will work out just fine.  Just like dating works out just fine in establishing lasting relationships with many people.  The big danger I see in this book (and Boy Meets Girl, for that matter), is that natural, healthy sexual desire is going to be stifled to an unhealthy extent.  This could very well create long-term problems in the relationship, the way repressing any kind of feeling for long periods of time does.  Why do preacher's kids often end up in so much trouble?  Because they repressed the need for rebelling and discoving their individuality as adolescents.  These kinds of repressed behavior have a way of catching up with you.    Obviously, we cannot always be acting on every impulse.  That would certainly screw a person up faster than regimented discipline.  Like most things in life, a person needs to find a healthy balance.  Now for some people, saving any kind of physical contact until engagement can be perfectly healthy.  But for the vast majority, I suspect not.  Ultimately, you are going to need to find this balance yourself, and if reading this book is part of your quest to do so, then take what Harris says with a boulder of salt.  
 Gilles Kepel is a really bright person, but this is one terrible book.  His idea is that Muslims may reject violence as counterproductive and instead achieve the acceptance of their wisdom by convincing us all.  In return for accepting their wisdom, they will accept our advice to be non-violent about it.  As for those who reject the truth of what they have to say, well, they'll simply shame us all into accepting their wisdom.  Did I use the word wisdom a little too much?  If so, it is because I think this book needs more of it.  Much more of it.  Kepel never seems to get around to condemning Arab propaganda.  And in an age where the international information supply has been seriously contaminated by arbitrary antizionist untruths, I think this is a serious oversight.  First we see Kepel misrepresent the 2000 Intifada as the work of Sharon, who clearly provoked the Arabs by visiting the Temple Mount, and Arafat, who clearly provoked the Jews by killing them in bunches.  But this is nonsense.  Jewish members of the Knesset had been visiting the Temple Mount, which is Judaism's holiest site, on a regular basis.  If non-Muslims were to start a war just because an Arab leader visited the Kaaba, we'd all regard this as an absurd excuse.  Kepel just adds to the problem by pretending that this is reasonable.    This is a serious problem with the whole book, because truth is central to the theme.  If Muslims are going to support truth, they may get their way without violence.  If they are fighting truth, they will not be able to convince others or shame them into agreeing.  The only options left will be violence or apology.  The author is convincing when he says that Israeli settlements do annoy some Arabs.  Now, these settlements are on disputed land.  They ought to be as legal as Arab settlements.  But let's forget all that.  Let us think only of justice and truth and human rights.  Here is where Kepel falls apart.  He keeps implying that in a just world, Israel would be trimmed down to size.  And that even if the settlements are legal, if Israel had to fend for itself, without anyone supporting it or attacking it, the size of Israel would decrease to something more reasonable.    Kepel has it totally wrong.  Israel has over 6 million people and over 5 million Jews.  In a just world, all else being equal, Israel would be much bigger.  And this is the core of the problem.  The present size of Israel is not a crime against Nature.  If anything, it is like low tide at the beach: one is making a big mistake if one expects the water to recede from it for the rest of the day.  The author admits that some folks support Israel here.  But he blames this support on a few "neoconservatives," implying that they are fighting against reality.  The truth is that the Arab side is fighting against justice and reality, and that such a war can't be won in the long run.  Once Kepel avoids saying that in a just world, Israel would be much bigger, it is easy for him to present Muslim violence as the wrong means for antizionist Muslims to convince others of their essential reasonableness.  And in his discussion of Europe, he concludes that European Islam will emerge with a "universalist perspective, freed from the straitjacket of authoritarianism and corruption."  Now, I do admit that the author is a learned and intelligent person.  And he may be right!  But as far as I am concerned, he could not have made a less convincing case.    
 The best way of persuading people to accept misinformation is to mix it with some credible information. And so Dore Gold demonstrates with this anti-U.N. screed.   Not an adamant fan of the U.N. myself, I began my reading already familiar with organization's questionable track record, replete with institutional corruption and bureaucratic ineptitude. This book, I hoped, might use the ample failures of the U.N. to issue a fair indictment and perhaps show the way to a more accountable and responsible international body.   What I got instead was propaganda from a former Israeli ambassador with an extremely large political axe to grind. Instead of allowing his conclusions to be dictated by the facts, Gold seems bent on ramming a pre-packaged conclusion down readers' throats -- that the U.N. "fans the flames of chaos" and "supports terrorism and terrorists" -- by selectively cherry-picking anecdotal cases, removing them from their political context, and hoping that most readers know so little about his examples that they will leap blindly from his shaky evidence to his conclusion.    Moreover, his decision to use the hashest possible language in accusing the U.N. of abetting terrorism and spreading chaos seems to reveal a personal hostility to the U.N.  This is, of course, speculation.  But what is not speculation is that the quality of his argument is lacking, perhaps due to the fact that it issues from a visceral reaction rather than a rational analysis.  As already stated, his thesis itself is questionable.  Rather than to accuse the U.N. of worthlessly neglecting to handle international crises in an adequate manner, Gold is adamant that the U.N. actually goes beyond that and *contributes* to the crises, chaos, and terrorism.  As a later reviewer notes, Gold specifically states, "**By not adequately dealing with** the conflict in Bosnia, the UN fueled the Balkan crisis, which eventually spilled over into Kosovo and Macedonia. The failures in Rwanda fueled a massive central African war in which five nations invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where approximately 2.5 million people died in the next four years. And as Iraq flagrantly violated UN resolutions on [WMDs], Libya, Iran, and North Korea ignored the UN's international control system on nuclear weapons [p. 224]" (asterics added).  But this claim is not analagous to "fanning the flames of chaos," which implies contributing to a condition through one's actions, rather than one's inactions.  It is more appropriate to say that the U.N., by "not adquately dealing" with these situations, is simply neglecting to stamp out the fire. Yet Gold is content to let his highly inflammatory accusations stand, as though the U.N. were helping Iraq to hide its weapons programs or were passing out machetes to the Rwandan Hutus.   If his thesis were merely that the U.N. fails to stamp out the flames of chaos, he would receive little serious argument.  He would, however, have to account for his analysis of why the U.N. is ineffective.  Gold's explanation of why the U.N is ineffective is that anti-democratic nations have come to dominate the body as its membership has expanded over the past half-century.  However this theory does not square with the examples he cites to prove the U.N.'s impotence.  For example, he mentions the failure of the U.N. to mobilize peacekeepers in Rwanda in 1994, and the utter impotence of U.N. "observers" who did nothing to stop the slaughter of Bosnian teenagers at Srebrenica in 1995.  Gold is correct that the U.N. was quite ineffective in both situations, but he does not give the true reason why:  the U.N. was acting within the constraints laid down by the Western states that Gold claims are so powerless and outnumbered in today's U.N..  In the case of Rwanda, the United States refused to acknowledge that genocide was even taking place.  In the case of Srebrenica, the UN "peacekeepers" sat idlely by because the Security Council -- dominated by Western nations (the "perm five") -- permitted the use force only to protect the humanitarian convoys whose presence the West was using as an excuse not to intervene militarily.  In both cases, assigning blame to the U.N., while only occasionally and sporadically hinting at the policies of individual Western nations, paints a highly inaccurate picture of the U.N.'s failures.  In these two cases, the inaction of the U.N. at mobilizing blue helmets reflected the wishes of wealthy Western states of the Security Council, not the Pakistans or the Irans of the U.N. General Assembly.  In other words, the West was handicapping the U.N., not the other way around as Gold tries to convince his readers with selective interpretations of history.  How ironic that in making his case against the U.N., Gold mentions historical examples that disconfirm his own thesis, and show why the U.N. has truly come close to irrelevance.  Gold also expends a great deal of intellectual effort into implicating the UN by association. Because officials of the U.N. like Kofi Annon have routinely met with leaders like Mugabe or Castro, readers are to believe that the U.N. is responsible for granting legitimacy to them and, thus propping up their "terroristic" and despotic regimes. Though interacting with leaders does grant them legitimacy, sometimes it is the only viable option.  Western leaders routinely meet with the heads of authoritarian regimes in the interests of peace and stability. What is worse, they often do so for sheer personal political or economic gain.  Gold is strangely silent on the fact that Rumsfeld was shaking hands with the Butcher of Baghdad as he was gassing Kurdish villages with chemical we sold him.  He also neglects to mention that Arch-conservative Richard Nixon visited Mao Tse Dong in 1972. Japan and South Korea, long-time American allies, conduct talks with Kim Jong-Il, charter member of the axis of evil, not because they support his regime, but because they understand that ignoring it is not a realistic option. One wonders why Dore Gold would be annoyed at the UN's disproportionate fixation with Israel's behavior, when he disproportionately criticizes UN diplomats for meeting the very same disreputable figures that Western nations have talked to for years.   This critique ultimately falters because it presupposes a balance of power in the U.N. that does not correspond to the body's structure.  The United Nations is a Western contrivance, depending on and thus controlled by Western regimes.  Nothing can get done without the unanimous approval of the U.K., France, the U.S.A, and Russia (as Gold very well knows, having watched in person many U.S. vetoes of Security Council resolutions condemning Israel).  Gold's constant allusions to obscure details regarding the U.N.'s minimal and loose associations with terrorist groups and authoritarian governments misses this big picture -- the bigger picture which is capable of producing the truly important lessons.  About the only thing that one can take away from this book is that Gold hates the U.N.  One easily realizes this from reading the title of the book, however, and need not even pay twenty dollars.  Of course the U.N. is not the panacea for all of the world's political ills, but this book does not even come within shouting distance of the many, far more complex reasons why. 
 I ordered a human resource book and it took 9 day when you said 3-5 business days. I thought i was getting a hardback book but when i got it..it was paperback with small print and black and white pages. I have sold books via Amazon but this is the first time buying and it was very disappointing 
 Dont get me wrong, if i would speak German i would love this book but even starting with the title it is hard to understand. What does monographien und texte zur mean anyways. I've read books before in languages i don't  understand and loved them. O yeah and where is Nietzsches 
 This suspense novel about CIA contract assassins attempts to take on a larger question, namely, how does one leave a life of politically necessary murder to become wholly human? The characters are not believable, nor are they compelling, as they sit around like dilettantes in a Harvard coffee bar talking about their feelings and having moral crises over snuffing lives. Eisler is convincing when he writes about combat, but the attempt to put a mysterious plot in here fails, as does an attempt to make these characters be either the animal within or an intellectualization of killing. If your reading is constantly interrupted by announcements over an airport PA, you're tired and totally bored, it might cut it, but otherwise.. 
 I chose this product because of its dual functionality as a bread box and slicer.  The bread box works great.  It fits our homemade 1.5-lb loaves fine and just barely fits a 2-lb loaf.  The holes are also just the right size to allow the breath to breath without drying out. The slicing 'rungs' are a different story.  I have a sharp bread knife and was hoping the rungs would help me learn to cut straight.  Well, the knife slices of small shreds of plastic from the sides and cuts into the bottom.  The plastic almost always ends up on the bread 
 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
 If you are looking for every detail known to modern man regarding all of the OTHER movies Mel Gibson ever starred in or directed, this is the book for you.  If you are looking for true insight into The Passion, just skip to the last few pages and you will still be disappointed.  I, too, am ashamed to say I spent a good deal of time wading through all of the details in the bulk of this book, hoping to get to the point.  Very disappointing 
 Very disappointed with this DVD.  Like I said above, if you want to view a rockumentary watch VH1 alot cheaper.  Description very misleading 
 We bought this toy for our 8 month old daughter in hopes of providing her a fun and shaded pool toy.  When we put her in it she did not fit comfortably in the seat and appeared as if she would tip over (she is on the larger side of babies her same age).  We decided not to test out if she would be stable or not - we went with instinct. Also, it was a breezy day the day we used it and the design of the float allows it to catch the breeze and go quickly across the pool.   I guess we will give her the blow up hammer in another float! 
 The notion that there is some pervasive conscious field or that one's conscious mind creates external reality is utter nonsense--and not even conjecture let alone scientific truth.    Beware of this author, for he has appeared on the film What the Bleep, a promotional psuedo-scientific video for the cult run by Ramtha, a woman claiming to be the channel for a 35,000 yhear old Cromagnon warrior from Atlantis.  You cannot make this stuff up!  Goswami is not associated with any true academic instituion and is so far off mainstream science that it is no longer science.  Older men of his age sometimes tend to turn to metaphysical pursuits to find a "scientific" validation for something beyond this life as impending death approaches.  But kid yourself not: This is NOT science.  It's bullsh*t.  Quantum mechanical processes have nothing inherent in them to elicit consciousness.  As of today, consciousness is still a complete mystery and there is no science to explain the phenomena.  What some like Goswami do, is take a subjec that few understand, namely quantum mechanics, which evokes the nebulous fuzzy notions of mystery, which also has a scientif buzz to it, and then presents it with terms like "superposition," "Schrodinger's cat," "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal," and effectively used the ignorance of the public at large to sell a false explanation of consciousness.  But ignorance of one subject does nothing to enlighten away the deeper ignorance of another topic, namely consciousness.  There is nothing falsifiable in Goswami's "thesis," hence it is not science but rather based on faith, and as such it is a religious argument that is based on really unfounded ideology and falsehood.  
 He didn't send me the product that he was selling. The keypad is not USB and also it wasn't new and also it wasn't targus. I want my money back or the real product that i payed for 
 I didn't like the book. It was VERY confusing because it was from the point of view of many different characters. I had a hard time understanding anything. I rated it two stars because it captured my interest less then 5 times and during those periods I only found interest for a minute. If you want to read a good book I recommend Harry Potter, A series of Unfortunate Events and book by Andrew Clements 
 Unfortunately I cannot join the chorus of admiration for this episode since the premise and execution is so one-dimensional. Perhaps the tragic element to the fate of Robert Culp's character, a scientist picked out of a hat to undergo a surgical transformation into an alien for the world to unite in defense against, might have had more resonance for me if the performance of his wife by Geraldine Brooks wasn't so Joan Crawford-ish. As it is their scenes together, particularly one where she cradles his head, have an odd mother-son tone, which is funny since the idea of her being pregant is repeatedly raised. Calling the shop they visit From Here to Maternity is a nice touch. What isn't considered is that if Culp had impregnated Brooks after begininng the transformation procedures, wouldn't that have an effect on her unborn child? Based on how Culp turns out as the alien, at least we know the kid will be damn tall. It's a pity actually that we're never given a clear view of Culp's alien get-up, since it looks quite remarkeable, and an improvement after the ludicruous amphibian of Tourist Attraction. This episode has a major plot hole, which is probably more obvious since the material is so shallow - why do the scientists need to duplicate the alien when they already have one captured which everyone seems to be terrified of, though it looks as threatening as a stuffed toy monkey? I suppose we're to think these architects are limited both by their fear, and their lack of expertise since their alien is downed so easily. Except for his awful over-acting in the "schizophrenic episode" scene, where he performs a dazzling jump into a wall shelf and seems to discover the method ramble simultaneously, Culp underplays and even gets a laugh when asked how he feels after surgery, and he responds depressed. There are some camp touches as well - Brooks hit with a symbiotic feeling of pain, when she is walking in the street, the stock footage of crowds running in the street in the opening movie, the way the trio of backwood hunters are framed together a la Ingmar Bergman, and the intense performance of Leonard Stone. Re the symbiotic thing, I liked a cut from panic in surgery when breathing stops, to Brooks head-tossed-back crying as she clears out Culp's office 
     What can you say about a book that introdouces three characters in one chapter? Or has a character thats entire vocabulary seems to consist of "Hotcha, Gotcha" and says that nearly 10 times a chapter. I would honestly not care if all the people upped and died. This book has no surprises but one, a "plot twist" that was obvious 6 chapters away. Did I mention I hate the annoying, underdeveloped, characters. Oh yes. I usually like Bruce Coville, but with this book, he has bought himself to a level of unreadability that is only outclassed by the sequel 
 In the begining of this book its was adventursum and kept you on the edge of your seat but I started to get board around the middle and had to put it down. The story line of this story was interesting and exciting in a  mysterious sort of way but really isnt worth reading. If I were you I would  skip the reading of this boo 
 This version is worst than their "In Blue" cd. Gosh, why can't people just be and stay true to themselves? This is the Corrs's first attempt to be "Americans" and that says it all. If you really want to hear them at their best, buy their first cd and their "live" cd, where their Irish culture and heritage shines through. But if you want to hear "non-Americans" try to be "Americans" and then fail, by all means this cd is for you 
 This book just drags on and on.  Buck's search for Chloe could have been handled in a fraction of the time.  One huge gripe, which represents incredibly poor writing, is the name changes used to refer to one character.  Ken Ritz is both referred to as Ken and Ritz, and not just in dialogue either.  One rule of good writing is to ALWAYS refer to your character by one name.  You wouldn't refer to a mother as Jane, mum, mother and ma in the one book.  Still, the book can be quite entertaining if you know what's coming next, which you would because it's been mentioned enough in the books.  One more thing that bothers me is recapping on past events-- the authors rehash the same old stuff 
 I began reading Forever Amber last week (hoping to find a book I might like while I waited for another one to come available at the Library) and from the first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this book.  But I am one of those readers that feels if a book is started then you should finish it.  Upon finishing it I feel cheated.    The book isn't all that bad.  There is a lot of movement, intrigue and history in it.  But I couldn't feel for the characters.  The main character, Amber, was not someone that I would like and even when things went wrong for her, I still felt that way.  I assume that no one is supposed to like her.  And although I didn't like any of the characters in this book, I guess I did feel something for Amber because I felt like she should be with Lord Carlton...up in until the last part of the book.  Then I realized that she shouldn't be with anyone.    The reason for the two stars is because of the ending.  I hated that ending.  I felt totally cheated after reading the whole 700 plus pages and then the book ending so abruptly.  I agree with others who have left reviews here, it seems that the author decided that she either didn't want to write anymore of this book or she ran out of things to write about.    Anyway, it was an okay book to keep me occupied until the book I have been waiting for becomes available but I would never recommend this book to anyone. It's really not worth the time.   I guess you either love the book or you hate it.  And I hated it. 
 Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.  I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1 
 Reading throug this mess was like banging my head to the wall.  Niles is undoubtedly one of the most talentless writers in the TSR/WoC branch.  The whole book is on autopilot, characters fall out and then fall back in, but you don't care, because you can't get a hold on them.  The villain and the surprise, even the setting are all obviously just plot devices, I couldn't care less.  The dwarven kingdom has never been sooo boring and dull.  There is no sense of time, doom and loss, and the whole is impersonal.  Skip it and you won't miss a beat [in the series] 
 An electronics technician of 8 years, I have a solid understanding of computers but I am totally new to internetworking and Cisco equipment. In my opinion this book is very poorly written and I do not beleive it was proof-read before it was printed. Since I am not a Cisco pro I cannot detect any of the errors between the information presented and how things really work, but I can detect all the inconsistancies of the information given.   Figures and diagrams that do not correlate with the text leave you wondering which is correct. Topic and chapter review quizes that ask things which were not explained in the text. There are answers provided in the back of the book to these quizes but 1 or 2 out of 10 of every 10 answers are incorrect and not ammended in the current errata. This is very frustrating to me because I have spent too much time reviewing material to figure out why I missed a question - only to find that I didn't.   When I emailed Ciscopress and explained the ammount of errors I am finding I was refered to a very small errata page. I offered to submit a list of items that I felt should be reviewed for accuracy... but should I be the one proof reading this text?  Will the $250 exam also be so flawed?   
 I've seen many reviewers argue that the use of DDT to prevent malaria deaths in the developing world is unjustified because 1) it may cause greater long-term harm to the environment, and 2) mosquitoes will eventually develop resistance to the insecticide.  One San Francisco reviewer even claimed "We have no idea of how many millions, or billions, of people globally have been impacted by its use in the forms of debilitating illnesses and death from cancer and the like." According to her, it's irresponsible to use DDT when we have no idea to what extent the negative impact, if any (although "billions of people" is a bit ridiculous), is of using it.  But there's no question what the negative impact has been of banning it: millions and millions of preventable deaths. So some environmentalists are apparently more than happy to allow an absolute--millions dead--in exchange for an unknown.  Part of the reason why it's so easy for them to trade lives for theory is that they don't give much day to day thought about malaria. It's a disease that doesn't worry people in the developed world. It happens "over there" in the third world, and if we actually get it over here, well, no worries--we get treated and fully cured with relatively affordable drugs. Who in the West actually worries day to day about dying from malaria contracted from a mosquito bite? It ranks up there with polio and typhoid.   But what would the "ban DDT no matter what the cost" environmentalists be saying if HIV suddenly became transmittable by mosquitoes? Would they continue to argue "we have no idea how many millions of people have been impacted by DDT's use" if they were one mosquito bite away from a death sentence with no cure (as peoples of the third world don't have or can't afford a cure for malaria)?  Nope, you can bet your bottom dollar virtually every one of them would change their tune pretty quickly--especially here in San Francisco. All their objections about "long term damage to the environment" and "resistance to insecticide" would suddenly transform into a mere theory once faced with the possibility their own lives could be in mortal danger. Activists would be storming the streets demanding the return of DDT with the same vengeance they exhibit today when marching for a solution to HIV/AIDS. Because it's a different story when it's no longer someone else's life that's on the line.  And hence we would have an even clearer expression of the hypocrisy of the new environmental imperialism they impose on the third world today--the kind that makes activists feel better about themselves from the comfort of latte studios and Volvo station wagons. Every day they tell the third world "we have cures for these diseases that you don't, so it matters not to us that our environmental crusade will take away your line of defense and you die by the millions" in exchange for good conversation at Starbucks. It's an easy trade when mosquito-borne death isn't tugging at *your* arm every day. 
 I just finished with this book after solving the six categories of tests and scoring myself. I then tallied my highest categories and looked up the careers recommended for a person of my talents. Believe it or not, at the graduate level ALL of the careers recommended were those of a scientist or science intensive. Yeah, imagine that. Not one non scientific career. Now guess what? I am a young physician-scientist and I DONT like my job at all. How wrong can the recommendations get! Been there, done that and know for sure that this isnt the field for me.  My genuine interest is finance and banking and while I got a well above average score in the business test, several questions seemed to rely on knowledge one would be expected to glean from an MBA or by working in the business world, and not any innate ability. Having never gone to B School or worked in a Business Industry, I felt short changed. Whats more, a test remarkably similar to this one had been administered at my school when I was in the tenth grade and I was told that I was most suited to a career in science.Ironically enough now I know that that is the one career I can say for sure isnt the one for me. Go figure 
 So I really like this case besides the velcro.  Basically I have it with me all the time and use it frequently.  The only thing is that each time I take my hp ipaq 4155 out, the velcro makes the loudest noise I have ever heard and everyone looks up and stares at my case.  I wouldn't recommend this one... I am actually shopping for one that snaps or zips 
 I would class myself as an intermediate-level OpenGL programmer, concentrating mainly on Linux programming with nVidia hardware but also interested in Mac OS X. I bought this book because I was interested in learning about the more advanced OpenGL features: shaders, shadows and vertex buffer objects.  For my purposes, I have found this book to be shamefully poor. So bad that I am going to return it ASAP. The parts of the book which cover topics of interest to me appear to be factually incorrect and are accompanied by incorrect code. The descriptions are minimal and padded out with enormous amounts of code. The code compiles on all the machines I have tried in on but segfaults reliably at startup. Specifically, the bufferobject, occlusionquery, vertexblending and vertexshaders demos all segfault. The lowlevelshaders, highlevelshaders, bumpmapping, fragmentshaders, imageprocessing, lighting and proceduraltex demos also fail to work. I believe this is because they are not properly written and fail to make use of the available features, quitting when they discover that not all of the state-of-the-art features are available simultaneously. The only demos which do work are the trivial ones or the plagiarised ones.  Moreover, the parts of the book which cover basics are often either plagiarised verbatim or plain wrong (much better information and code can be found on the web, e.g. NeHe, and in the OpenGL Red Book). Many of the descriptions are needlessly convoluted. Many of the diagrams are huge and pointless. I suspect this is simply because the authors are way out of their depth.  I hope this review will help anyone else duped by the claim of Linux compatability. I would also caution readers interested in Mac OS X and Windows because the examples and code are likely to be misleading and are definitely not platform-independent. In the future, I would greatly appreciate more honest authors who stick to what they know 
 While I agree with others that this camera takes some pretty nice pictures and is easy to use, I've had the same problems as many have noted here. For starters, the thing eats through batteries like there's no tomorrow. I was lucky to get 20 pictures before the batteries crapped out. My biggest problem, however came when my son was handing the camera over to me at the dinner table and it slipped out of his hand. The camera literally fell only 10-12 inches to the table, but that was enough to render this camera permanently inoperable. Be warned: if you are a little bit clumsy or have butter-fingers, think twice before buying this camera! Red-eye reduction is also a bit of a joke with this one 
 Ramones Raw is basically Marky Ramone with a handheld camera annoying Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee and C.J. while on tour. There is some great live footage of the band playing some classic songs. The DVD doesn't really tell a story but is more of a narrative of the Ramones life on the road. The inner relations of the band are not touched upon at all. In fact, by watching Ramones Raw you'd never know that Johnny and Joey hated each other with a passion. Most of the running time is lighthearted gags and inside jokes interspersed with concert footage. For a complete look at the inner workings of the band, as well as the making of most of their albums, pick up the End of the Century DVD it is a MUCH more comprehensive look at the band as a whole. Recommended for Ramones Diehards and completists only 
 I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie.  I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words.  Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words.  It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it 
 While reading this book I found that I was rolling my eyes every page. The author rambles on relating tidbits of information that don't seem to fit together at all and are, at best, poorly organized with no discernable order (chronological, by topic, context, etc). I have no way of verifying the authenticity of most of the information (it is after all a book on secret intelligence), but I know that some of the stories are so inconsistent as to make all the information in the book suspect. 
 I bought this (luckily, used) based on the excellent reader reviews I read here on Amazon.  I could not have been more misled.  This is one of the worst self-improvement books I have ever read. It is bad beyond anything I could have expected, so bad that had I not gotten my hopes up for a good read with some good advice, I probably would have fallen out of my recliner laughing.  This book is a very thin gruel of other writers' ideas, dumbed down for the sort of reader who finds literary satisfaction in  romance novels. The substance of this book is nothing more than "If you write down what you want--and keep writing it down, if necessary--you'll get it."  Hmmm.    "Hmmm" is right.    Hardly anyone these days isn't familiar with the earlier New Age incarnation of this idea--writing affirmations--and anyone who has read the writings of the Founding Fathers of motivational self-improvement (like Napoleon Hill) has seen it as well.  Far, far too much of this book consists of anecdotes.  The anecdotes range in their effect from soporific to nauseating.  Take "Gloria's" story, for example.  An entire chapter is devoted to Gloria's search for love, for a husband.  She writes letters to a "soul mate" that she has not yet met.  Among her puerile love-maunderings, she writes a description of the soul mate she hopes to meet:  He is a "beautiful" dresser, and has "Strong hands, deep integrity, and spiritual truth," and a gift for "making and having money." She doesn't want the money because she's high maintenance and loves to spend; no, she wants the money "for the joy, love, peace, and bounty it can bring the world."  (Uh, yeah, sure Gloria.  Clearly you're one of those unfortuate individuals who believes her own bs.)  After two years of writing this sort of pabulum to herself, Gloria goes to a bar, gets picked up by a lawyer, and marries him 11 months later. As we all know, lawyers typically possess exactly the sorts of qualities she was looking for in a soul mate, so this outcome is hardly surprising....  The book doesn't get any better than this, and there is even a short chapter at the end of the book to help you rationalize the failure of the techniques (for lack of a better word) described between the interminable anecdotes.    Most importantly, the advice simply doesn't work.  This book really is a silly piece of nonsense.  Skip it. 
 This movie is intriguing because it was written by Billy Wilder and stars Dean Martin and Kim Novak. It may entertain hard-core fans and its subject matter was considered racy for its time, but the story never fully transcends conventional 1950s influences. 
 This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. I don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. The NSA almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked.  Besides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed. This is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide 
 Lee Eisenberg's "The Number" simply does not live up to its promise as a financial planning self-help book or retirement guide. Short on advice and long on anecdotes, little useful information is imparted.  Much better advice can be found in Eric Tyson's "Personal Finance for Dummies", a truly helfpful finance guide for the average person.  
 ... this is a subtle tip off that this album is not worth buying. Not for more than fifty cents.  Like I said, the ONLY good song on here is the Rolling Stones cover "I'm Free". And I even like The Soup Dragons' rendition better than the Stones' original. But the fact remains that the rest of this album is a dull drudgery of a mess to get through. This album is practically a single for "I'm Free", but with twelve extra songs of filler you'll never listen to more than once (if at all). Hmmm. What else can I say about "I'm Free"? Oh, yea... the music video for the song is quite awesome. Its so trippy and tie-dyed out! But that still doesn't change my review. Or stoic state of mind.  One star out of five 
 For the Mob historian there's nothing really new here outside of lotsa pure fiction. If you want the real story of Sam Giancana check out "The Don" by William Brashler, "Mafia Princess" by Sam's daughter Toni, and Bill Roemer's bio of Tony Accardo. But forget the hogwash of "Double-Cross" 
 It's hard to believe that Random House actually published this total waste of time.  I don't believe this writer is capable of even writing a coherent obituary!  Save your money 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 This is junk. Since the end of the Soviet Union, it appears that "swarthy" Arabs are the new evil which the - guess what? - handsome, dedicated, sensitive-because-his-true love-died, intelligent, military-minded white guy has to single-handedly defeat and, of course, save Western Civilization from the narrow, evil-yes, "evil" again-tentacles of Islamic terrorism. And, as is the case these days in this whole genre of trashy spy novels, "Islamic" MEANS "terrorist."  And our Golden Boy does what we expect him to. This is so trashy and predictable, I feel Ludlum ought to pay us all back. Don't waste your time. 
 I would think twice before ordering this edition.  It took several months to arrive and for some reason I thought I had ordered a set of the books.  Instead, I got a big, unwieldy brick of a book with very small type.  I've been trying to read it, but a lot of the time I do just as well by going to the Project Gutenberg site and reading the book there (but not all volumes are online yet). One advantage of reading online is the easy ability to look up vocabulary.   For the price, it's simply not worth it 
 Blondie has always either hit or miss, which was an admiral quality they possesed. None of their albums totally hit the mark, bt they dared to explore.Here, nothing hits the mark period. It's grating, abbrasive, tuneless and a mess. It's bad, real bad.What ever happened to Jimmy Destri's solo effort from 1981 Heart On A Wall? If you can find it cheap, get it instead. There are 2 good songs on it. "My Little World" and "Little Metal Drummer" with Debbie doing background vocals on this western flavored instrumental 
 The only reason I gave this CD one star is because you cannot rate a CD with zero stars.  I would not recommend this CD at all.  First, several songs are not really Gregorian Plainchant.  They will start out with chant and go into a strange polyphony.  But the worst thing about this CD is that it is of a horrible recording quality.  It sounds like the monks are singing into a microphone through a fan.  Some of the songs they don't even finish, the recording just fades out.  It is extremely low quality and I would highly recommend other recordings such as the monks of Santo Domingo de Silos or the monks of Solesmes.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD!  This is not a good example of Gregorian Chant 
 A music on this disc is very good and can be a good introduction into Tatum's world. It's also not too complicated. Bad news is quite poor sound quality. Good for listenign through PC speakers but decent Hi-Fi system reveals all recording's shortcomings and make it quite disapointing 
  While I admit to occasionally using the phrase "in the trenches" to describe software development, I generally consider military analogies to be inappropriate descriptors of how software is created. A military organization is composed of a rigid command hierarchy where orders are not to be questioned. No software development shop could ever be run in this manner. Military subordinates can be screamed at, ridiculed and within general guidelines that are sometimes exceeded, abused. Once again, that strategy does not work in the business world.  The worst military analogy offense in the book is chapter ten, "Psychological Warfare." While keeping a team functional using psychological techniques is a well-known tactic, the means of psychological warfare are completely different. The authors admit this when in the chapter they utter the sentence; "Mastery of these techniques should provide tools for effective persuasion in both group situations and face-to-face interactions." There are many problems in that sentence. An argument that techniques used to psychologically weaken an enemy in warfare will prove effective in working with team members in a business setting is absurd. Also, there is the key word "should", a weak word indicating that the authors are not convinced that these tactics will work.   This absurdity also appears on the back cover in the form of the blurb, "With hands-on exercises, real-life war stories and a take-no-prisoners attitude, `Software Architect Bootcamp, Second Edition', won't just help . . . " I have no idea how the authors of this book conduct their businesses, but in the development teams I have worked with, that kind of tactic destroys the consensus necessary for people to work together effectively. In fact, I have no idea what a "take-no-prisoners attitude" is supposed to mean in a software development environment.   While I found the military wording to be an unnecessary distraction, there is some good advice in the book. Using architecture in the same sentence as software is a relatively new phenomenon. Recently, the complexity of applications has grown to the point where developers have split into different areas. There are still people who write the code, but now there are others whose fulltime job is to develop and manage the overall structure of the application. These people, commonly called software architects, need to be trained in ways completely different from the code writers. While they need to learn how to put software components together, they also need to be trained in how to articulate their vision and convince people by rational argument. The authors cover the different aspects of software architecture and end each chapter with a set of essay questions that are partially answered.   I really have ambivalent feelings about this book; it does contain a great deal of useful information regarding software architecture. However, the absurd analogies weaken it when compared to others, so that is why I only give it two stars. I would not use it to train software architects 
 Some good ideas on driving innovation, but in hindsight, some of the cited companies haven't passed muster if one tracks their long term business performance.  One of my favorite quotes from the book - "At Enron, failure - even of the type that ends up on the front page of The Wall Street Journal - doesn't necessarily sink a career".  Yeah right!  This kind of thinking puts one in jail 
 Title begins:  "The Party of Death: The Democrats..."   Just tonight - August 14, 2006 - while being interviewed about this book on the Colbert Report, Ponnuru *clarified* that what he calls "The Party of Death" is really a collective of all who are pro abortion, regardless of political party! Ponnuru explained that he knows it's NOT ALL Democrats that are pro abortion, and he openly admitted there are Republicans who are pro abortion!  So Colbert asked Ponnuru if he had also included the word "Republican" on the book's cover (to be fair) to show that some Republicans are in Ponnuru's collective "Party of Death", and Ponnuru said no, he did not include the word "Republican" on his book's cover, and Colbert then asked that maybe Ponnuru didn't have enough ink to print the word "Republican" on the cover, or maybe Ponnuru didn't think he had enough room on the cover to include the word "Republicans" along with "Democrats" for the reader to understand his collective "Party of Death," which again, according to Ponnuru on national TV, is a group category that includes all who are pro abortion, not just Democrats.   Yet the inside flap of this book asks, Is the Democratic Party the "Party of Death"?   Does Ponnuru even know what he's talking about when he's this mixed up, completely contradicting his book's cover and inside flap on national TV? 
 I rented this movie for about six dollars and I have to say even that was a waste of money. I thought this movie was incredibly over acted, boring and hard on the eyes. The thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did. They were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial. For the superficial people out there I wouldn't watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won't get it. When I found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible.   I have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment 
 Isn't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say, "Yeah! yeah! That's me!" and then gives you no answer, or a weak one to which you say, "No duh!" I'm afraid this book is one of them. The title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right direction to get started! But I was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that God gives us desires that we can't have on earth so that we will long for Him and Heaven. I don't believe that's the abundant life Jesus promised. So I went to the Bible. (I should have gone there first!) I looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer. "Delight yourself IN THE LORD and He WILL give you the desires of your heart!" Ps. 37:4 So I set out to seek Him. I started reading "Knowing God" by J.I. Packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire! I hope you'll find them too-in Him 
 After reading A Brief History of Time I decided that I wanted to learn more about Stephen Hawkings himself and how he became who he is today. I picked up this book written by Kitty Ferguson, which is claimed to be a biography and started reading it. After about twenty pages she was done talking about his life and started talking about his theories. This was disappointing to me because I thought the book was a biography.   As I continued reading I became somewhat confused while she told about Hawkings discoveries. The explanations were little or none in trying to get the reader to understand the ideas. It did not help that there were very few small illustrations that were in the book to go along with her explanations. If there were highly detailed color illustrations such as those in A Brief History In Time, it might have been much easier to understand.  I did enjoy the beginning of the book where Kitty goes into detail about the beginning of Hawkings life but I feel like it was just an overview of how he became who he is today. I would not recommend this book, instead I would recommend A Brief History In Time because it is much easier to understand because it has great illustrations and is not so mathematical 
 I had been using a Hauppauge MediaMVP Digital Media Receiver (Model 1000) and quite happy with this $99 device. I was able to play my recorded videos and show my vacation photos on a large screen but it died mysteriously and I thought I would upgrade to this more capable (or so I thought) device. I had lots of problems getting it working correctly and used it with 3 different media servers (both the one that came with the device and the Windows media server worked for me).  I use the device primarily to watch shows I time shift from cable. There are two features that make this $200+ device far inferior to my previous device.   1) The fast forward is "fast" in name only. Perhaps it doubles the speed but it does not seem that quick to me and I spend a LOT of time watching stupid ads. In addition to FF the Hauppauge had a feature that would skip 30 or 60 seconds at a time that made missing commercials a breeze. There is a "jump" feature but that lets you enter the total time into the clip you want to be so if it actually worked (it froze the device each time I tried to use it and I had to unplug it to even get the thing turned off) it would be a pain to use.  2) When I had watched part of a video the Hauppauge remembered where I had stopped and offered to restart from that position. Image my frustration when I clicked the wrong green key (sending me to the video menu) about 2 hours into a movie. To get back to where I was I had to slow-forward for an hour to get to see the end of the movie.   Who ever designed the software that the remote uses should be ... (well I will leave it to your imagination). So after mucking with this for to long it is going back to Amazon and I am going to buy another Hauppauge 
 Of the dozens of books I have read about the Beatles, both individually and as a group, this is one of the most glaring examples of unreadable drivel I have seen.  Another reviewer lauds this book for not containing any factual errors, when, in fact, it contains many, all easily verifiable through other reliable sources.  Sandford's writing style is obnoxiously self-absorbed and annoying, and his reviews and opinions of the Beatles' music are totally unnecessary and expendable.  There is little here that hasn't been hashed over dozens of times in other, better books.  I opened this book with high hopes, but closed it with a sense of sad disappointment 
 Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought 
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 I saw a few scenes and couldn't even continue watching.  I like a lot of Charles Bronson's movies.  Examples include "Death Hunt," the 80s "Death Wish" series, and "the White Buffalo."  But his acting in this movie is unrealistic.  He does not act like a real Apache.  Bronson seems to overdo it on being "stoic."  A relative and I watched a few scenes and just switched channels.  Bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real Apache.  Paul Newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an Apache-raised white man in "Hombre," which I purchased on Amazon.  I do applaud Bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the Apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the 1880s.  Given the time period, perhaps Bronson should have hired Roman Gabriel instead.  He does a realistic job of portraying a Cherokee Indian in the "Undefeated," which was also released around the same time (give or take a couple of years) 
 Just sad and bad poetry. This is the kind of stuff that middle school kids write. I can only guess that those who praise Boof's literary "work" are in fact praising her political positions. 
 Please don't be fooled by it's inexpensiveness. I am a victim of it. I already bought this card and within 2 weeks I started getting read and write errors. I formatted the card and it now has 2 MB of bad sectors.  Unlike the other reviewer I did had 2 GB to begin with. But I think it is bad quality product and thats why it is dearth cheap. It is not at all reliable.  Now I am contacting their customerservice to replace this card for me 
 I have to agree with the other on here. I got this for my 5yr for christmas and She seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now It sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it. I was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat, not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead. I tried and didn't think it was all that fun either. I threw the box away and I'm sure I need that to return it. If I could I would get her something else in return that she could use 
 This CD was very uninformative and provided almost no information about the topic it was supposed to address, which is meditation. The speaker is very preachy and rambles on and on about unrelated topics. Very unpleasant voice to listen to, very boring. Big waste of money 
 I agree with one of the reviewers who pointed out the anti-social nature of the author. I also agree that the author's self "selling points" are simply a modern copy of the "emperor's new clothes".   I noticed that majority of the posters claimed that this "master's text" is incomprehensible. As a matter of fact, I believe that the entire book are just the psychotic rambling. So why bother even to read it!?  
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
 Please, gimme a break.  I can't believe people can treat Will's writings seriously.  The ONLY reason, he gets press is because he bashes the Church.  People don't like the Church, because they do not like its moral teachings and authority.  Modern, popular culture doesn't like the moral teachings and authority of the Church, because they lack the moral backbone to strive for the virtuous life.   So, for all his pomp and bravado, Wills, like many others are merely justifying their immorality.  Hardly what I would  call a noble enterprise 
 I purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from JMM.  However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over.  The entire album is pretty much "blowing flowers out of your [rear end]" types of songs. The title cut, "Pictures" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more.  It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote.  Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money 
 While the writing was acceptable, I felt that the juxtaposition of the classes in this novel was very forced.  The differnce between the classes is too obvious.  The contrast between the rich world (the students in the Wilcox school and the Cornhills) and the streets of London (and Isa's forced marriage to the grocer, and Mrs. Cornhill's predictable and obvious snobbery) was not one that led me to feel any of the injustice.  I was left cold by the overall plot.  One thing that truly bothered me was the fate of Mr. Cornhill and Isa.  I felt that the way it happened in the book left something to be desired, and was not in true Bronte style.  The characters and their development also left something to be desired.  They were too predictable at times, and Mr. Ellin was just annoying.  There were few occasions when I sympathized with any character, other than Isa (and only at certain points in the plot). There was nothing spectacular about this novel, though I won't discourage anyone from reading it.  It was fast paced and it did hold my interest.  
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 Elizabeth Lowell is a good author, but she's really bad about re-issues.  I've been tricked by her books before.  I don't know if this is her publisher's doing or her own, but it makes me think twice and twice again before I buy anything with her name on it.  She's been writing for a long time--I can't always tell from the synopsis if the book is new or not.  Her re-issues or new releases ought to be clearly labeled as such (I think Nora Roberts does this now.)  You have to open this book and look at the small print to discover she previously published this as "The Ruby" under Ann Maxwell.  I don't know what the rationale behind this was, but it's hard to imagine it was done in good faith.  
 I absolutely would recommend avoiding this item. It has a vile aftertaste - even if you can stomach artificial sweetener, this product's flavor is so blatantly unnatural. If you can get past the sweetener and the frightening list of ingredients, the texture isn't particularly appealing, what with the tiny granules floating throughout. I know this dessert sounds too good to be true, and it is 
 Mostly bereft of scenery or any notice of local lifeways, hardly a travel book at all, Hindoo Holiday strikes me as being a vicious portrait of his host and benefactor, a maharajah who, like Ackerley, was on the self-defeating quest for the devotion of an Ideal Friend, and, like Ackerley, looking in all the wrong places for love. Ackerley's book is condescending to Indians in the colonial British manner that was abhorrent to Foster both in his time in India and in his masterpiece A Passage to India, Hindoo Holiday is notable for a lack of empathy on Ackerley's part, but, then, in his entire oeuvre, it is only the irritations and heartbreaks of his surrogates that matter. Ackerley was far too solipsistic to be a novelist 
 The story is nice, actually a marvel, however the storytelling is little more than the quality of a not so astutely written newspaper column.   That the two animals bonded is nice, but we see that in nature videos. The photographs are nice but they're nothing to rave about.   
 An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.    I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read. It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 I was a big fan of the ST1. The plot and characters were excellent, it rated up there with the best of them I would give ST1 5 stars. I saw this was on sale for a great price so I got it expecting great things. Usually sequels aren't to par with the originals so I at least expeted a 3-star movie. When i flipped on the movie i said "WOW....right where they left off" at a pretty good battle seen with the BUGS. Well, that was it I was waiting for more action. I waited....I waited...I waited and I waited...they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still wasn't worth it. I don't know who's idea it was for the sequel but I hope this was their last one. I'll stick with the new Battlestar Galactic and Star Trek reruns 
 This overview of the cold war suffers from serious omissions. First, Walker neglects to describe some of the darker aspects of the cold war such as the crimes and atrocities associated with both Soviet and US backed puppet dictators. In particular, he never discusses how the US overthrew democratically elected governments in Latin America and replaced them with brutal dictatorships friendly to American businesses...Guatamala especially comes to mind. The oppression of Eastern Europe as it came under Soviet domination under Stalin also deserves more attention.   Second...the role of China in the cold war could also have been discussed and analysed in far more detail. Being the most populated country in the world, the Communist victory in China indeed was of extreme significance, especially during the Korean war when over a million Chinese troops fought the U.N. forces in bloody battles. China also played an important role in providing weapons and resources to North Vietnam in the Vietnam War thus prolonging a conflict which the U.S. ultimately lost.   Another aspect of the Cold War given little attention relates to the third world conflicts. A number of Soviet client states were established in the Middle East, including Egypt, and this contributed to the Arab-Israeli conflicts, especially the 1973 War. The civil wars in such countries as Angola and Ehtiopia, both related to Communist revolutionary insurgencies and takeovers also get minimal coverage.  Instead the author elaborates on such convoluted and monotonous topics as how the Cold War distorted the world monetary-financial systems. Thus besides failing to discuss important topics the author takes an exciting and intriguing subject and presents it in a boring and tedious manner 
 After reading Brian Green's "The Elegant Universe", I wanted to learn more on the possibility of a world made of more than 4 dimensions, time included. L. Krauss seemed to offer the opportunity not only to learn more about these extra dimensions based on scientific knowledge but also to melt it with an insightful adventure into the history of human creativity which has already imagined such world. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Both the scientific and artistic parts are poor and shallow, a shame when the explanation of a multidimension world is at stake. The rhetoric has nothing of the passion and the doors-opening of Brian Green's book. Too bad 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 A long long time ago I can still remember how my sister Used to play his songs  And in the 80s changed his style Songs like Love Touch were so vile And Forever Young was on the charts too long  But this whole series makes me shiver With each new horror it delivers Bad and cheesy music It always makes me so sick  I can't remember if I spewed when I Heard him sing "It Had To Be You" But his integrity tore in two  The day the music died 
 When I purchased these drapes, I assumed that they would match the tan plaid material used in the Zanzibar valences, sheets, etc. Wrong! The material is striped, and is a darker, different shade of brown than the rest of the set. I love the other items in this set, but don't waste your money on these drapes--they look awful 
 I've enjoyed Johansen's books for years, but this one was awful...I'm beginning to wonder if she's using a ghost writer.  Totally ridiculous plot, trite dialogue...I lost count of the times she used the phrase "Sophie said through her teeth..."  I was beginning to wish someone was PULLING my teeth rather than having to read this book.  Johansen is capable of SO MUCH BETTER than this!  I'm praying she isn't falling into the Nora Roberts/Danielle Steel/James Patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher's deadline 
 Unfortunately, I was made to watch this film in a French class I took. While I could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate, it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character's face. It was honestly one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters' faces. 
 as I did when the criminal's motive was revealed. In the first place, the criminal was totally obvious, yet when the moment of denouement came I was dumbstruck, and not in a good way. I guess sometimes *fiction* is stranger than *truth* in spite of the old cliche.   I greatly, greatly enjoyed the Mrs. Murphy mysteries for the first several books, but all good things must come to an end, and my enjoyment certainly did. After finishing "Sour Puss" I went to my bookshelf and pulled out "Wish You Were Here" and began re-reading it. I was really surprised at how much the series has changed since its beginnings. A good many of the characters have strayed so far from their original characterizations as to be almost brand new people.  Naturally one would expect the characters to evolve as do all people.  I really do miss Harry being at the heart of the town of Crozet...she never should have left the post office.  As always, the animals' observations are the only reason why I continue reading 
 The interviewer is very annoying.  At times he interrupted Jerry's answers, finished Jerry's sentences and blabbed on about his own ideas 
   I "enjoyed" viewing this film and seeing "the good guy" win. But, "there must be a better way" to resolve conflicts, "a better way" to punish bad guys,  "a better way to deal with evil" than just go out and kill everyone involved!  We live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in Iraq and The Sunnis killing the Shiites and vice versa, etc..etc.   I always believe there MUST be "a better way" besides everyone killing the other guys.  So, that's what I have against this film.  As for the film itself, I enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of Clint Eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast. It is a "good film" except for the violence.   And, yes, "the good guy" does win in the end---I'm happy about that!  And, I enjoyed the photography also.  So, yes, definitely SEE the film but as you do, could you possibly think of "a better way" for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film?  Email:boland7214@aol 
  "Nothing's okay," Westgate Penitentiary inmate Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) says, "I gotta get out."  That's because the sadistic screws are keeping the otherwise tractable inmates down with BRUTE FORCE.  You treat a man like an animal and he turns into one, right?   At least so sayeth the usually reliable director Jules Dassin in this overripe movie about a prison on the edge of explosion.  You see, the bad guys - the inmates - have a backstory, told in a series of flashbacks, that proves they're good guys under the prison grays.  They just got hooked up with bad women who made them do bad things.  Flashbacks don't lie.  They don't necessarily entertain, or keep a movie chugging onward at a comfortable clip, but they don't lie.  The prison officials, on the other hand... the otherwise decent warden is weak and vacillating.  The avuncular doctor drowns his reprehension in brandy, emerging from his alcoholic stupor  periodically to crack wry about the inhumanity of it all.   The baddest good guy is Capt. Munsey (`Sir' to you), Hume Cronyn, an effete sociopath with a blood taste for dishing it out (he seems particularly fond of whips) and a penchant for the insinuating seduction.     I wanted to like it, but as BRUTE FORCE plodded forward, piling melodramatic excess on melodramatic excess, I found myself fighting it.  Fighting the notion that everyone in effective authority was a heartless goon, the ineffective ones were broken (presumably by the ruthless System), and the inmates were misunderstood choirboys.  Despite its good looks, good performances and exciting final scene I had too many "Aw, c'mon" moments to honestly say I liked this movie.     The transfer print is in good condition, and the disk includes a hands-free Stills Pressbook Gallery with a number of behind-the-scene photographs, publicity stills, lobby cards and posters. 
 Overall I did not enjoy this book. The general over tone felt quite negative 
 This map is small.  A good overview of Barcelona, but if you really want to navigate the streets by foot, you need a bigger map.  Though this map shows most of the streets, a lot of them aren't labeled.  You are better off just getting the Lonely Planet book and using the map in the back.  The only good thing about this map is that its laminated 
 Do you wanna know a secret? I promise you that you could live without ever finding out. This movie's only secret is who the hell was dumb enough to produce it. I would also like to know why anyone who read the script would have signed a contract to star in it. Joey Lawrenece was obviously hard up for some cash or else he wanted to expand his acting into a new genre... bad films. The DVD is so cheap that there aren't even menus. Suspense?... Drama?... There is absoluetly more suspense and drama in movies like Legally Blonde than this one... also you get to see the real Reese Witherspoon and not a girl who was hired because she looked like RW. Also, if the "hero" of the movie gets hit in the head one more time... I swear I thought for a minute I was watching an episode of Jackass. The back cover of the DVD is simply incorrect in its summary of the movie. The spoiler doesn't even provide correct info about the plot. As for the rating, there is no 0 star so I had to give it a 1 star. However, this movie's only 1 star qualification was that it was in color and the text on the back of the case was without spelling errors. The only suggestion I can give is not to buy this DVD. However, rent it if you are having trouble falling asleep. This movie will definately put any insomniac to sleep. Beyond horrible, the only thing left that can be said is... "Que el infierno! 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 Machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing. Showed it to a repair shop, says the fuser is a toast. Replacement cost part and labor $300. Died just after one year so have to bear the expense. Poor design/quality. Beware, i searched the web and looks like i am not the only one with this problem 
 I subscribed to Cooks Magazine some years ago, back when it  began publishing again.  I had problems with issues that failed to arrive, and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern.  Since that time, I occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest.  Even by dint of casual glance, I've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the "perfect recipe" for something or other.  I now skip right to the "perfected" recipe, and decide whether its worth committing to memory.  Some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best.  There are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me:  1.  Product Reviews:  They range from just plain wrong to idiotic.  The KitchenAid Pro 600 was hailed by Cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores.  Yet, the Amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart, allowing the metal gears to separate.  Christopher Kimball (the editor) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight.  No, I'm not joking.  In that evaluation, Le Creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy.  All-Clad, even though it conducts heat very evenly, suffered for not having as much heft, and therefore was judged pricey, on a pound weight basis.  One issue of Cooks boasted on its cover "Unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others".  Apparently, Hershey's was designated best.  Not too many months later, Callebaut was recommended above all others, and Hershey's was judged barely acceptable.  Feeling manipulated yet?  2.  Finally, there are those dreadful editorials by Mr. Kimball.  Rambling, painfully written, and punctuated with a picture of Mr. Kimball wearing a bow tie, and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it. Mr. Kimball is a humble man, with much to be humble about.  He writes as if he were chanelling Helen Gurley Brown, but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play.    Time to re-vamp this magazine, folks 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 Note that this video has nothing to do with Cesar Millan's television show on the National Geographic Channel called "The Dog Whisperer"  The DVD teaches the most basic dog commands, and is ok.  But if you want books or DVDs related to Cesar Millan, this item has nothing do with him! It is a different author, teaching altogether different things, writing before the television show was on the air.  
 This movie is stupid beyond words. I watched a half hour of it and COULD NOT watch any more I was so lost and BORED. Makes no sense, talks about creepy gross and disgusting things, is boring and stupid!! Don't waste time on this dull as dust film 
 There's no doubt that this is a gorgeous book.  Unfortunately, I think it's better for your coffee table than your kitchen.  While there are beautiful pictures (lots of Nigella) and several great recipes, the book didn't seem very useful to me.  I bought and loved "How to be a Domestic Goddess", so, I got this book from the library to check it out, thinking it would be somewhat the same.  I have to say I was dissapointed.  I only found 4 usable recipes in the whole book.   (Granted, I am not a gourmet chef by any means, but I do consider myself to be a lover of great food and a Good cook.) While there are some nice recipes and lots of great photos this book is a more of a "pretty to look at" picture book than a hard core recipe resource.  
 First off let me start off by saying that I am a very big fan of Edwin McCain, his band, and his music.  I bought this DVD thinking that there would be a good bit of live footage with him playing, but was only left with my pocket's empty, and my hopes shattered.  Edwin McCains personality is portrayed here, as all other reviewers have said, but that really is all that this DVD does well.  With only about 15 minutes of Live music I, as a viewer was left asking myself why Edwin and ATC Records decided to put this disc out.  The only notable music on this DVD is "I'll Be".  This is very easily Edwin's lowest quality item put out, lacking the passion, and originiality that so many of us know him by.  A noteworthy Story, if not the only one is the story of how he wrote I'll Be, and the only reason that it is noteworthy, is not because it is a great story, but rather I'll Be is a great track.  So if you have money to spare, and time to waste then you can buy this DVD, but unless Edwin releases a new DVD I suggest, that you stick to his CD's 
 I thought this book is going to be interesting but I was wrong!  Don't bother reading this book if you are interested in Mysticism because you are going to be disapointed!  Every other page seems to be a quote from another  source, nothing original.  Very boring 
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 I got what I paid for. Allows for four frequency options at the top of the dial - all of which were picking up real broadcast signals in my area 
 I just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) because they seemed inexpensive, durable, and came in many fun colors. I was sorely disappointed. The colors are pretty, but the material is  crummy. Its rough, flimsy and feels like plastic. The pastel colors (citron, cool mint etc) are almost see-through and definitely show patterned underwear. The tops run quite large (i wear a 6-8 on top and the medium is VERY Roomy, i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again). 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 I recently bought this item after reading the review for this book. I found this to be a mistake. I am an engineer by trade, and I found myself reading old school books so I could understand what this book was talking  about.  This book covers a wide variety of information and is difficult to  read.  This is not a book for the layman.... 
 The work of a 12 year-old without talent. Phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy, inappropriate similies. Story line is absurd. If this were Koontz's first novel, no publisher would touch it 
 I hate to be the only one to say it. but this movie sucked.  It's very strange to me how the premise being about a bluesmen going to Tuva to connect with throat singers was abouts something else entirerly which was not inspirational.  This movie is really about the stupidest americans going to another culture and being disrespectful.   The main character paul pena is the biggest complaining ass.  He manages to stay pretty drunk throughout his whole time in Tuva, and in one instance hands an unsuspecting Tuvan a joint.  Not that i wouldnt have enjoyed doing that as well.  But its hard to take since Paul also complains of needing medication and being depressed.  But paul isnt the only ass of this documentary.  He also has help from his Friends of Tuva and the filmers.  if there is any value in watchings this piece of @#*# its in what not to do when you visit other countries.  Seriously, one of his friends even got into a fight and almost died there.  From that character's earlier appearences in the film, i would have to say that he  would have deserved it.  The only thing going for this movie is photage of acual Tuvan's singing.  Im so sorry they had to meet this guy.  If you do decide to get this don't forget to watch the interview with the directors.  Thats definately the best part.  Ive met some pretty ridiculous film students before, but this two are like charactures of them.  if you are interested in seeing other movies where americans act retarded in other countries i would recommend seeing The Journey Of Man 
 WOW! Bad book. I gave this book one star because it felt good to end the pain. If you want lots of cult facts this isnt the book for you. If you want a not very enjoyable read....READ THIS!  What was the author thinking when she wrote this. It wasnt cool it wasnt funny it was bad. 
 The first edition of this book had several factual errors and exaggerations.  To her credit, Wolf has corrected some of these errors.  However, the main thesis of her book, and a deeply flawed one at that, has remained unchanged.  Wolf argues that having been scared by the increasing successes and power of women in the West, some men decided that the best way to put women in their rightful place is to occupy their thoughts with self-appearance and starve them.    Some concern with self-appearance is not difficult to understand.  Humans have a basic aesthetic sense and desire attractive mates.  Therefore, where one ranks on an attractiveness scale should be somewhat of a concern to many people because one realizes that others also desire attractive mates.  Women often tend to be very selective with respect to choosing a male partner, and the men whom they desire, usually having their choice of women, will naturally go after the more attractive ones.  Hence the reason many women are preoccupied with their looks...they want the best man they can obtain and know that men value beauty.  If women were less choosy about men, they would need to be far less concerned about their looks because some men will sleep with almost anything.  Surely, patriarchy cannot be blamed for making women choosy about men because most men would prefer that women have lower standards.    It is true that female high fashion models tend to be young and skinny; however, these models also tend to have multiple traits more typical of men, i.e., they tend to closely approximate the physique of adolescent boys. This should not be difficult to understand if one considers the fact that the typical high fashion designer is a male homosexual. See a newly published book in this regard: "The Nature of Homosexuality: Vindication for Homosexual Activists and the Religious Right."  For a visual comparison of haute couture models vs. glamour models, see the supporting materials for this book at amazinginfoonhomosexuals.com.    Influenced by the high status of haute couture models, several women diet unnecessarily and may also indulge in excessive exercise.  Male [...] fashion designers are to blame for this, not patriarchy.  Once you control for the influence of high fashion models-courtesy male [...] fashion designers-and fashions, the beauty industry is largely responding to a mostly innate desire among women to make themselves attractive but is not generating this desire. 
 I sincerely hope this is not the new wave in ethnography.  This book is a poor piece of self-indulgence, and disrepectful of the Afro-Cuban traditions that the author is apparently using to make a career 
 This book is an expensive waste of money. Carefully read all the reviews below and you'll have gotten the gist of the book's contents... about 5 pages of useful info padded out to 172 pages.   Even better, buy and absorb Ian Rowland's Full Facts Book of Cold Reading at ianrowland dot com which will tell you everything in this book and more in straight English without all the pseudoscience and NLP hocus pocus.   Regardless, if you are a poor listener, you aren't looking for a book to improve yourself. And if you think you need a book about being a good listener, you probably already are a pretty good one. 
 I want my two hours back.  This film struggles to find an audience.  I cannot imagine that it will inspire anyone to join the military (at least the fictional one it portrays!).  Furthermore, it's message is utterly ambiguous- much less than what the veiwer deserves for putting up with its boorish crassness.  Skip this one 
 I bought this book to help with sales and communication. It failed in this regard. For a text book explaining the concepts this book might rate higher, but for a pratical book to use in life, work or sales forget it. It might help if I had a few hundred hours(maybe thousands of hours)to pratice the techiniques in it. But it might not help then either. There is no way you could pick this book up read it and apply it. The author uses many examples of the questions which tell us the type of person someone is in many different areas. But the setting for the questions is a job interview. The many questions and many of them are very odd might work in an interview setting where someone is wanting and needing employement or a promotion, but I can't see how it would work in a sales enviroment. Most people wouldn't put up with too many prying questions when shopping. This is probably a good book in a textbook way but not in a real life usable way 
 Here's my sincere take on Savage: I think it's mostly an act. Savage understands Biology as a discipline and decided to carve out a niche for himself as the most vitriolic and angry of political commentators. There's just no way a guy could be that angry without having a blood pressure problem so extreme that the pressure he thinks he's under would violate Boyle's Law.  Having said that, how does singling out a section of the population genuinely advance the political debate in this country?  If a person wants to marginalize the political extremes the USA should then go to a parliamentary system of govt., which seems to be what the founding fathers envisioned anyway, before Alexander Hamilton got involved.  For those who doubt my veracity, please read the Articles of Confederation and articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution. Our Constitution's major flaw, IMO, is making the prez commander-in-chief, which has allowed our past and current presidents to use the military as their own private police force. Just look at that ginned-up Iraq war were stuck in now. I will say as a former Republican that I'm aghast at the Orwellian nature of the current administration, which seems to be hostile to civil liberties taken for granted in the English speaking world for 900 years. I certainly hope the Supreme Court doesn't uphold a law which makes possible the suspension of Habeas Corpus, especially at the discretion of this president.  We may never get this right back. We didn't seem to need these laws when we fought terrorists in the past.   I'm aware that the book's title is taken from a quote by a Roman senator. But Savage doesn't have a monopoly on Roman quotes. Here's 1 from the Roman historian Tacitus worth considering:   "You have made a desert, and call it Peace." 
 I thought the original was pretty good, but this sequel was pure torture to watch! I'de rather eat a giant roach, than watch this movie again! Without question, one of the worst comedys ever written 
 This was my first book by Pickover, and it will be my last.  His chapters can be entertaining, but ultimately they lead nowhere, and cast no light into the dark corners of the universe.  For a scientist and self-proclaimed skeptic, he seems a bit enamoured with new age mysticism.  In one chapter, he talked about writing down and trying to achieve 100 goals in life.  If one of his goals was to write a pointless, self-promoting book, he can check that goal off his list 
 When I got my book in the mail my face instantly went pale.  It was not what I had hoped for, though my third grader will love it .  The drawings/graphics are well done, but rarely any size data (how big is the leaf you're looking at for example) and not a single scientific name in sight.  I think adults will tire of the book easily for there's not enough detailed infromation.  If you have ever tried to distinguish a black oak from a red oak this book is not for you.   At last, for $3.99 it's a good deal for your kids. 
 The lyrics to the title track sound like they were written by a 2nd grader. "When the sun goes down we'll be movin'/When the sun goes down we'll be groovin/When the sun goes down feelin' all right/Everything is hotter when the sun goes down."  It almost makes "Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong" seem intelligent.  
 Why? Because this book says nothing more than what he had already said in A Brief History of Time. However, I will say that unlike A Brief history of time, this one is a really, really big book with lots of colorful pictures so that they can charge an extra 30 dollars. And that he also changed the titles of the chapters. That's something...and the pictures were pretty!   Believe it or not after I read Universe in a Nutshell I decided to give good ol' Steve one more shot so I picked up A Theory of Everything. However, to my surprise, within those pages I didn't find a theory of everything...but I did find somehting that amazed me more than a theory of everything every could...Inside, I found A Brief History of Time! He had fooled me again!  It's a conspiracy, this man is publishing the same book over & over again with different titles to fool people into buying them. And he's including illustrations now because he discovered how well worthless pictures sell! Don't buy into it! It's a trick, underneath the new dustjacket, pretty pictures, and new chapter headings, these are same words!  I proclaim myself to be the first to say "I will not be fooled by Mr. Hawking again. 
 I returned the book for a refund. The book contains too many errors! The installation instructions in Chapter 2, contain so many errors that I lost all confidence in the remaining sections. If you purchase this book, good luck getting past the installation...  I'd give it 0 stars if I could! 
 Because it is the most incomprehensible book I have ever tried to read.   I was originally triggered by the title, hoping this book would offer me insights from French philosophy relevant to Weberian issues around rationalization etc. It may be the case that someone in human history is able to establish whether this is the case or not.   For me this book has proven to be completely inaccessible twice now. It contains essays of app. 5 pages each, that usually are unclear, contain irrelevant and distracting references to unrelated issues (e.g. Indian mythology) and proceeds with pointless texts. A complete waste of time and money 
 I have no idea why this one's still in print, much less in so many editions, as if it was some sort of classic.  What "Miss Blandish" is, quite simply, is a straightforward rip, in theme, incident, characterization, and plot, of Faulkner's "Sanctuary". If you read "Sanctuary", you'll be  effectively getting the same story, plus a much higher level of writing, plus an introduction to one of the great writers of the past century. So don't waste your time on this thing.  Chase was a serial plagiarist, and also made a play at copying "The Big Sleep". Chandler, faster off the mark than Faulkner, hit him with a lawsuit and forced the book off the market. So you won't find that one on Amazon.  
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 Silly me.  I thought perspectives meant more than one view.  This book,  while claiming to be an indifferent look at the New Age Movement, obviously  is written by staunch backers of the Movement with too few exceptions to be  considered balanced.  People shouldn't pretend to be scholarly when they're  simply being cheerleaders for an idea 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 I read them all.  Grishim, Turrow, etc.  Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should.  There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped.  The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.    Kermit, you have the talent.  Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us 
 In December 2002, I purchased the pet chime and paw & two additional paws.  I was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks.  In the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by Lentek.  They're great, IF THEY WORK 
 If you're looking for a new take on the Victorian Christmas ghost story (as this novel claims to be), well, this may not be the book for you.  Palliser takes his time setting up this tale, in which the ghosts are more figurative than anything else.  The first 200 pages or so are filled with plot lines that seem to go nowhere and tales that have you moving from the 9th to the 17th to the 19th centuries.  Quite confusing, and, frankly, rather dull.  Had this been a short story, it would be quite good, but as a nearly 400 page novel it is simply tedious 
 Teena Marie - Sapphire (Cash Money Classics, 2006)  I picked up Teena Marie's latest album, Sapphire, the other day. As I listened to it, I started to think very fondly about "A Rose By Any Other Name" (featuring Gerald Levert), "I'm So In Love", "Black Rain", and "I'm on Fire". Those songs are, however, from her last album, La Doï¿½a. When you listen to an artist's current album and can't stop thinking about how good her last one was, there's a problem.  It's not that any of these songs are bad, or that she's trying too hard to be cool (we're already used to veterans trying to fit into today's urban landscape). It's just that most of this album is dull and boring. A lot of the songs are about love and sex; even her last album was more varied in theme. Also, the musical arrangements leave a lot to be desired. The good songs to me have to be the very first one ("God Has Created" with Smokey Robinson) and the very last one ("Resilient [Sapphire]" with her daughter, Alia Rose).   What's between those are 70 minutes of filler with the exception of "You Blow Me Away". And for "Baby Who's Is It"  ("who's" should be spelled "whose", by the way), it is unnecessary for Kurupt and Teena to rap and sing (respectively) the same lyrics together. One or the other would have been fine. Furthermore, I don't really wanna hear about Teena smoking spliffs on a reggae-lite jam ("Simmer Down"). And what's the deal with "Somebody Just Like You" ending with her saying, "Are you ever gonna get a job?" It doesn't even go with what she was talking about.  This review may be unpopular but I just wasn't feeling this album. Call me an old head but I think I'll go back to listening to La Doï¿½a or even better, her older, early '80s stuff. -EJ 
 I LOVE Sly Stallone.  Love the man dearly, but wow, is this movie bad.  I really couldn't even make it all the way through, it was so bad.  As heralded as Stallone is as an actor, he really only made a few good movies.  The Rocky movies, Rambo movies, and Cliffhanger was pretty good.  Get Carter was an abomination 
 I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon. It was one of two crock pots they sold, so there wasn't much choice. I had to replace my previous Rival as steam kept coming out of the lid and spewing liquid everywhere, and the knob melted off!!  Right away this lid doesn't even fit the crock. Not only does it rock back and forth, it has a gap in it that you can actually see inside of. I get that you can't pressure seal these things, but I can see steam, liquids, and what-not spewing from this one too. After reading the reviews of it being too hot, I am returning it 
 I read the previous review and decidid to buy the book anyway.  The previous reviewer was absolutely correct -- nothing new here.  I believe readers would be better served with Lyn Siler's two previous books 
 This series is really showing its age.  The selection this year is particularly poor, with very few exceptions.  The problem is that both Collins and Lehman prefer a kind of watered-down, anecdotal style rather than truly challenging work. Too many names are repeated from past BAPS.    Somthing must be done to alter this formula and give this series new life, because it really could be a great thing.    
 The movie is not good but a lot can be learned by watching it through, even though it drags. The 1950s 'babe' played by Jayne is a period piece, but having lived in Las vegas for the past five years, I can tell the readers of this review that the type is alive and well in this city. The  film is about a certain niche, created by men and probably by religion too,  and into this niche women step and become stigmatized. The whore or babe is  like the witch in the medieval period - something demonic and devilish. I  assure you, the values in the film are not out-of-date. The movie also is  an interesting source of info about ethnicity and regionalism - espec.  Italian and the NYC area. And you see in this a connection to Las Vegas  too. The film, if it teaches anything, teaches us that we are far less  emancipated, liberated, rational, liberal, etc. in regard to sex and to  women than we thought we were. Again the parallel to witchcraft is a good  one: naive liberals thought the witch-hunting was over in the early 1700s.  In fact, witches were burned in all major European ocuntries into the late  1700s. And 1950s babes a la Mansfield are not only the adult identity of  many, especially in Las Vegas, in the year 2000, but are probably the  role-models of 6 and 7 year olds. ... 
 I was really disappointed after reading this book. It is definitely not for parents who believe in attachment parenting. This book is anti attachment parenting! Author definitely doesn't believe in nursing past a year and not only advocates CIO but also suggests you go cold turkey because according to her your baby can't tell the difference between 5 minutes & 5 hours! Author if can't encourage extended nursing, shouldn't discourage it by giving ridiculous explanation like it can disrupt your babies sense of autonomy and misguide new mothers. Tons of research has been done on millions of benefits of nursing beyond one year, which were not even mentioned in the book. I don't recommend this book to anyone! This book does tell you not to yell, spank and use punitive methods. It does discourage schedule feeding. If you are reading other gentle discipline books, this book doesn't have much to offer 
 Dolph Lundgren (Universal Soldier, Blackjack) plays a man who is hired to take out a primary target and helping him is his old partner, Gina Bellman. Soon things heat up as the two security guards working at the building they are at start to get fiesty and one of them takes drugs and sees spiders and stuff. The 2 are also in a heated romance and get caught in a deadly cat and mouse game of double cross as the agency they are working for want them dead. Another Dolph Lundgren stinker vehicle though Lundgren can't act if his life depended on it. He couldnt pull of He-Man and The Punisher, he can't pull off anything else. Gina Bellman is hot but her acting is horrible as well as the rest of the cast. There's nothing like being hired to kill people and then have sex. Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander). Bottom line is this actioner is a borefest 
 It's entirely unfortunate that Garrard has come to be considered the be-all-end-all of Gentilleschi scholarship.  While the hefty opus features a wealth of research and a moderately well-illustrated span of pages, Garrard's feminist arguments do not line up. Citing the artist's "rape" by Tassi as a motivating force in the creation of her paintings featuring strong female characters, Garrard corners much of her argument on the Susanna and the Elders Gentilleschi painted a full year before the encounter with Tassi.  Further, Garrard casts a 20th century feminist eye, and an accusatory one at that, upon the artist and her situation. She hardly considers the psychology of the 17th century, nor the legal definitions, where "rape" and its current emotional and psychological ramifications were hardly present. Indeed, court documents and statements show the artist and her father suing for marriage to save the family name; not once is there a mention of emotional hardship, but instead purely economic. Other sources depict a heated, smitten Artemisia, who continued her affair with Tassi for a year before discovered by her father, exposed, and forced to bring legal action against tassi. Conlusion: 400 years ago, forced sexual acts had not the same social identification of today, the psychology was different, and, honestly, Garrard neglects to illustrate the other sides of Artemesia and focuses on one event defining a life of artistic creation that, while reasonable for a 20th century situation, is unfounded for a Baroque 
 Within the first 12 min of this audio book this "author" blames all the flaws of our (American) society on "liberals" and the "intellectual elites".  Rather odd considering the fact that she: 1. graduated from Yale, Summa Cum Laude.  2. did her graduate studies at Cambridge University.  3. received her J.D. from Stanford University Law School. 4. actually won an Outstanding Intellectual Achievement award.   Oh yeah, she is also a frequent guest on Fox News. Need I say more?   This is a kinder, sweeter, gentler Ann Coulter - but far less entertaining.    Needless to say, don't take this book seriously. 
 This book was useless as it was way too short...don't bother... 
 I bought this to connect via 1/8" Monster patch cable directly to my CD player. There is a ton of static and line noise introduced when using it this way. If I could give it zero stars, I would! Avoid! 
 Wow, you'll be hard pressed to find a more cliched and do-it-by-the-numbers comic.  And that's saying a lot.  This 'manga' (it wasn't made in Japan so it's really stretching the definition)involves an idiotic claims adjuster, Jeremy, who is being framed for fraud by his best friend, Jake.  When he finds out, what does he do??? Appologizes for tearing up Jake's office looking for proof and helps him clean it up, then takes one of Jake's cases to make up for it.  There is no suspense, tension, or intrigue in this dull and flacid book.  The plot obvious and the characters all act like they have the intellegence of preschoolers.  If you're looking for something creative, entertaining, or interesting, look elsewhere 
 This book may seem informative to many people, but it is in no way an accurate portrayl of Mormons.  The author tries to craftily make it look like she is praising the people, while subtlely belittling them.  It should be understood that there is much diversity among Mormons as with any large religious group.  There were some problems with the author's understanding of Mormon doctrine as well.  If you want to learn about the Mormons, learn about them from their scriptures.  That will teach you more than these sorts of books 
 This book looks good only at first sight. However, try and solve the exercises and you see there is more to VaR than the author wants us to believe. This book is too incoherent to be of any use. Just take a look at the index: A lot of things are introduced but are never used again later in the book. This makes me wonder why they were introduced at all. Some examples from the index: Hessian, GARCH, Markov process, etc. The biggest fault however in my opinion is the treatment of Monte Carlo, the most essential tool for VaR calculation: Condensed in roughly 30 pages compared to roughly 110 pages for mathematical preliminaries and probability cannot cater to the same audience 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 I heard the samples....how are you going to be talkin about God and then cussing the next second. Doesnt make sense. A lot of people dont even know what speaking in tongues really even means. Other than that...the album is just garbage...lets admit...bizzy bone is just wack now. No song on that album I feel is worth listening to. 
 Pink Floyd is one of those perfectionist bands- each one of their chords and verses was meant to sound the way it did. Altering the sound just destroys the meaning of the song, which is what the Scissor Sisters did to it. The song has been twisted from a classic  song depicting a battle between Pink and his doctor to a cheesy, disco dancing song that has no meaning. The Scissor Sisters completely missed the point of the song, and made my ears hurt on top of it. For shame 
 I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it.  Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it 
 The Item doesn't work properly.  The video quality is okay.  There is a loud background static type of noise both on the TV and on the computer video card when I attempted to record a show. The background noise makes the product useless 
 This is not the book I thought I was buying.  It contains almost nothing about the actual search for sunken treasure.  Instead, as noted by another reviewer, this book is primarily a character study of the people involved in this expedition.  It also reads much like a diary of the feelings of the author about the expedition itself.  Which is really not what you want to hear about when you expect the book to tell you about the exploits of the salvors digging gold out of wrecks tens of thousands of feet below the surface.  I'm just glad I didn't buy this in hardback 
 As a middle school 6th grade teacher, I experience the gamut of behavoir issues from too much chatting, to rudeness to the occasional pushing/fighting.  I found myself reverting to what this book suggests you don't do (but most teachers do) and that is to constantly say "Don't" and "because I said so".  While I control out of punishment and consequences, I was not feeling I was controlling out of respect.  I was searching for a book that could help me, and came across this one.  I liked the simple concepts. I liked the actual examples used of typical classroom issues.  This book made me "think" about how I am coming across to my kids now and how I SHOULD come across.  The only part of the book that left me wondering was 'how do teachers have time to implement this'.  I wish the author could have addressed that issue more 
 The first song is GREAT, but after that the album just doesNOT compare to the first one.  Sorry I bought it.  Too much SCREAMING for me.  
 I am currently a medical student, and Physiology is on our required texts list.  It's an awful read.  Very dry, very dense.  Difficult to keep interested from one scattered clinical tidbit to the next.  PLUS,  there were multiple mistakes in just the few chapters I made myself go through.  Thinking about petitioning for a new text listing for next year's class.. 
 I bought this set to add to the single 4 piece set I bought at a  retail store several years ago, which I was totally satisfied with, and Pfaltzgraff isn't what it use to be. My original set was made here in the U.S. and was perfect and defect free. This new set comes by way of China and it shows. Obvious flaws and defects were found on several pieces, one of the dinner plates now has clearly visible scratch marks on it just from eating off of it ONCE! I suspect I will be replacing this set a lot sooner than anticipated. My made in the States set looks brand new after all the years I've had it now. That's why I bought Pfaltzgraff again. I'm sorry I did. It's a shame to see a company sacrifice quality and reputation for the sake of profit!!! Also be wary of buying online. My first shipment had several broken plates in it upon arrival and I had to request a second set be sent to me. That process did go smooth and I was credited for the first set I sent back at Amazon's expense. Bottom line is Pfaltzgraff disappoints me they need to seriously review their quality control of their over seas production 
 The problem I've always had with Christianity (among other religions) is that it tells you what's wrong with you without asking for any feedback from you (unless your feedback agrees with Christian theology), then offers the "only possible way" to fix you.  And should you feel that "the way" honestly doesn't make sense to you, you're told that's part of your problem.  And further, that if you don't come around to "the truth," the worst tortures await you.  Does that tactic sound familiar?  Think fascism, communism and every other flavor of totalitarianism.  The tragedy of Christianity (and, again, of quite a few other religions) is that it turns the Source of Life and Love into just another dictator, and turns us into that dictator's eternally cringing underlings.  That may be Christianity's idea of God, but it certainly isn't mine.  And somehow I suspect it isn't God's idea of God either.  I found "Mere Christianity" to be an excellent representation of Christianity.  Other Amazon reviewers have already given examples of Mr. Lewis's convuluted logic in presenting his case.  So I'll just add two more.  Mr. Lewis says the one thing we must never do is see Jesus as merely a highly enlightened teacher.  According to Mr. Lewis, we have only three choices, based on Jesus's life: that Jesus was either Lord, liar or lunatic.  I honestly don't see why I can't have that fourth choice: to see Jesus as a highly enlightened teacher.  But that's because I don't consider the Bible the inerrant word of God. I believe the gospels were written by very human beings who shaped a lot of it to put across their own agendas.  Thus I don't see these recordings of Jesus's life as inerrant either--though I do see many, many examples of high-enlightenment in them.    In Mr. Lewis's argument for Jesus being one of the "three L's," he assumes that we've accepted--or must accept--the Bible as the inerrant word of God.  But before you make a logical argument, you must be sure the people you're addressing are in agreement with the assumptions behind that argument--in this case, that the Bible IS the "inerrant word of God."  Mr. Lewis never bothers to do that legwork.  What he does (as do, from my experience, most other Christians) is make assumptions FOR us, and then argue from there.  Naturally, the arguments fall flat if we haven't accepted those assumptions in the first place.  And because I haven't, the fourth choice opens wide and invitingly for me: that Jesus was a highly enlightened teacher.  In the second example, Mr. Lewis extols the Christian doctrine of having sex only within marriage, and being completely chaste otherwise.  To justify this, Mr. Lewis points out our sex-fixated culture and claims that this is the result of letting our animal drives take the lead in our lives.  He asks us how we would view a culture that fixated on food (assuming the people of that culture weren't starving)--a culture which, for example, had the food equivalent of strip shows: audiences gaping lustily as a plate of food was shown on stage.  Isn't our own culture's focus on sex just as pathetic?  What Mr. Lewis overlooks is the fact that when we fixate on anything (again, assuming we're not starving for it), it's never about the thing itself but about OTHER issues going on inside us.  People who continually overeat don't do it because they're biologically hungry.  And people who continually focus on sex, even though they might already be having sex on a regular basis, are not doing it because they're biologically in need of sex.  Again, there are other things going on which have nothing to do with sex.  Thus, Mr. Lewis makes the following assumptions (as always, without consulting us beforehand on whether we agree with those assumptions): (1) Any focus on sex outside of the context of marriage is purely a matter of our sexual drive and has nothing to do with anything else going on inside us; and (2) the way we experience our sexual drive now is part of the consequences we suffered after our Fall.  And with these assumptions, Mr. Lewis arrives at his "logical" conclusion: that the (as usual) "only way" to live happily and healthily with such a sex drive as ours is to observe the doctrine of absolute chastity outside of marriage.  I suggest there are other ways.  For example: to learn to be very conscious of what's really going on with you, and decline from using sex to act out your issues.  Further, to resolve to always treat your intimate partner with honesty, consideration and affection, and never ever use him or her for merely your own gratification.  For the result of using another person is invariably not only alienation from that person, but from ourselves.  In any case, there's absolutely no truly logical argument that can be made for only having sex within the context of marriage, and being totally chaste outside of it.  If you choose to accept that theology for your own life, fine.  But don't ever try to make it seem logical, when it's really a matter of private faith.  Several reviewers have stated that they began Mr. Lewis's book as a non-Christian and finished it as a Christian.  I began Mr. Lewis's book as a non-Christian, and finished it absolutely affirmed in my faith, which is highly spiritual and sees God in the most unconditionally loving terms.  I thank Mr. Lewis for that. 
 Junie B. Jones: Kindergartener. She's worrying about having a boyfriend and living "happily ever after" in her strange Junie-like world. First of all, her grammar is horrible and is fighting over this poor little 5-year-old boy named Warren, who just wants to be left alone. Even Lucille and Grace liked him, and Junie B liked him because he was on a T.V. commercial. I'm 9 now, and I think Junie B has lost her mind of wanting a boyfriend. Then, she begs her mom to go to the mall so she can buy princess clothes to make Warren notice him. She made comments like: "And he was beauty to our eyes..." "What a chunk." and "...I think I'd like him as my new boyfriend." She said she needed to "move on in her life", which I thought was silly. OK, so she learned you shouldn't make friends by buying fancy stuff to make him or her like you, but Junie B needs to quit thinking about boys and more about her English 
 If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death (which has been around for 15? years) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can. This product is not safe at all, no matter what they call it. Get a BabeSafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby, and use only 100% cotton on top of that (between your baby and the mattress cover). Do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100% cotton blankets. Run from this product 
 The problem with Mother Teresa's critics is that they attempt to hold her up as some sort of glorified social worker or political leader.  She was a religious.  She wasn't out to solve poverty, but to council and comfort... indeed, love the poorest of the poor, and to teach others to do the same.  Critics who claim the sisters are "sheep" who "blindly follow" their leader again do not understand religious life.  There is an oath of obedience, and you follow instruction, happily and without question.  If you want to be an independant helping poor people, then become a social worker.  These are different callings and different lives 
  Physical labor sucks.  Okay, you know that, I know that, even Paris and Nicole (thanks to their reality show) have gotten it through their puny little brainage, but it's news to Barbara Ehrenreich, whose previous stints as Ph.D earner, activist and writer did not expose her to the grubby working world of dirty hands and aching muscles that most of us have managed to live through.   It's a shame. This could have been such a great book, but B.E.'s got a preconceived agenda (welfare reform is never gonna work!) and an axe to grind (unless we raise minimum wage to 14 bucks an hour!).  To prove her point she goes undercover for the better part of a year, taking entry-level, low-skilled work while staying in expensive short-term housing. Of course, she could of just crunched numbers -"Let's see, 7 bucks an hour times 40 hours, while my pretend rent is $200 a week...carry the zero...nope, can't afford it" - but that would have just given her a puny little 2,000 word article for Mother Jones.  Book deals, on the hand, require more work, more commitment, but think of the royalties, so off she goes, just like Paris and Nicole, to work as a waitress, maid and Wal-Mart associate.  At least until it gets too hard.  B.E.'s got a litany of complaints - my feet hurt, my back hurts, piss tests are demeaning, my boss is a jerk, customers are rude, my back huuuurts - and seems to think that only the minimum wager has to suffer such indignities.  News flash, Barbara!  Every job is stressful in its own way.  I'm a RN and it's a rare day I don't come home feeling like I've been beat with a stick.  I've been verbally abused and cussed out more times than I can remember, and that's just by the docs.  I've been pee'd on, poo'd on, run ragged, and called  "girl" by my stupidvisor (My response: I'm older than you, and I've had sex, and I'm pretty sure you haven't by the looks of you, so, boss, who's the "girl" here, and who's the WOMAN.)  I will admit I get paid significantly more for my putting-up-with-BS than the average Walmartian does for his.  But then again I earned a college degree, I had to pass a difficult competency test and I work under the constraints of my nursing license, for which I had to get fingerprinted and background checked.  So that's why I get paid more than a minimum wager, even though our jobs, probably 97% of the time, are comparable.  I'll give B.E. 2 stars for her writing.   It's smart and witty and at times, she borders on hilarious, especially when she's mocking the minorities and poor that she claims to want to help.  Hey, I didn't say she was compassionate, I said she was funny.    B.E., if you're reading this, consider this angle next time you want to write a book about not getting by.  Write a book about being poor and uninsured.  Write a book about wanting to advance your position in life, but not being able to, because as soon as you take that better paying job or go into business for yourself you'll be kicked off medicaid, and you'll run out of inhalers for your asthmatic kid, and you'll have to listen to him wheeze all night, and when you take him to the charity clinic a week from Tuesday, because that's the only time the retired charity doc can see you, you won't be able to afford the prescription since it's over a hundred bucks for one inhaler, so then you have to quit your job so you can qualify for medicaid.  Then when you're done with that, write another book, this time about the lack of decent public transportation in the majority of the U.S., and how this results in needing a car to survive, which leads to excessive personal income spent on cars, more tax money spent on roads and highways, to say nothing of the hidden costs of car accidents and obesity from driving everywhere because it's too dangerous, with all the cars on the road, to ride a bike.  Those books would be worth reading.   
 I've only been on a gluten free diet for four months, so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid.  The worst part is that Amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this.  I'd put it out for the squirrels but I'm not sure they'd eat it.  If you're expecting something that tastes anything like bread, you're in for a shock 
 Stack was chosen to lead a former International Harvester plant that was nearly bankrupt.  Instead of massive layoffs he focused on rapidly increasing sales and obtaining employee involvement through opening the books.  Sounds too good to be true.  Large unions have had open books for years - yet, G.M., Ford, etc. have not benefited to any great extent.  The REAL problem in business today is "meeting the China price."  To my knowledge China is only just now looking into diesel engine remanufacturing (Springfield Remanufacturing's business).  We'll soon see how effective open books are in combating competition paying only 5-10% of American wages.  If they fail, open books will have proven to be a fatal distraction.  On the other hand, "open books" doesn't hurt, is somewhat helpful, and may be wonderful for firms not facing intense price competition.  (Several Internet searches on Springfield Remanufacturing were unsuccessful in obtaining latest financial performance data - I'm not even certain it still exists.) 
 when you reach the second half of life you need ginko biloba to remember what you did fifteen minutes ago. The meaning has always been there.Remember the golden rule - love your neighbor as yourself. Don't waste your money. I read this book and gave it as a gift. I liked it. But I can't remember anything about it 
 this review is not based on plot or writing skill of author.  the graphic presentation of the book was so unappealing and overstimulating, that i couldn't even read it and returned it.  furthermore, the fact that this was a 400 page comic book should have been mentioned in amazon's (or antone's)listing 
 I think the story wasnt that great.I didnt think it was very good because it was only about mainiac magee running away and him beating every one in all the sports 
 I had to read this book for a history class in college, and I must say it was a poor choice for the class.  The author throws out many obscure names, and expects you to know who they.  He goes on and on about the authors of the period and their respective eccentricities.  The reader is treated to countless pages about who so-and-so was friends with, and what tea party they attended that evening.  It simply fails to help the reader appreciate this remarkable period in America's history 
 I thought this mat would be good for catching the litter my cat flings out of the box but really it just ended up catching some of the litter and looking like an ugly eye-sore. It also hurts to walk on with bare feet. Having wood floors, I hate sweeping 3-4 times daily because my cats get a little too over zealous trying to cover up their waste in the litter box, so I thought I'd give it a try. Helped some, but overall I'd say not worth the money 
 not worth it. very low quality paper, low quality reproductions, bad ink.... publisher has put his profit over any quailty for the reader 
 The cover claims that the book has been "revised and updated for the digital age," but Winston's information on technological tools is both superficial and already dated. The term, "PDA," does not even appear in the index 
 The works of E.A. Wallis Budge were out of date before they were even published. His sole gift to Egyptology was the popularisation of the field, leading at the least to extended availability of funding. While interesting  as a piece of scholarly history, no beginner should work from this book  alone; Budge's understanding of the language is fallible to a degree that  would forever mar the education of the casual student in the Egyptian  language. My suggestion would be James Allen's new "Middle  Egyptian", if not Gardiner 
 More garbage that subtly steers the reader away from the idea that Washington had "No Idea" about the 911 attacks and that they merely screwed up. This book is for cowards that are afraid to look at the hundreds of glaring pieces of evidence that point to Washington pre-knowledge; actually,I think Mossad did the dirty work. I get sick of reading junk like this that serves to only mellow out and support insecure people that cling to the phoney American Dream while they wave their stupid little flags that are made in Red China. The complicity of the American sheeple is beyond belief! Every body is willing to become a suck up like Stalins Yezhov or Beria believing everything that is said to them, then Bang, right in the head. What will you Sensible, moderate sheeple say when the North American Union 2010 and Shafta steal your job and corporations steal your retirement. Another similiar piece of garbage that advances the "Innocent view of the CIA and Washington" is E. Howard Hunt's Book "American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA" Completely sanitized of any useful information. If a book has any truth to it, it will be either "Out of Print", Extremely expensive or the Author will have died of lead poisining ( Gary Webb, Gurudas, David Allen 
 This book was good for me spiritually: it bored the hell out of me 
 Perhaps the lesson one can learn from this album is not to buy an album because of one song  . . . you heard in a commercial.  I bought this album and found out that I have been duped again. Is it wrong for me to assume that an album I take a chance on can have two good songs on it?  I wasn't expecting this to be Moby, but even so I was caught off-guard by how abysmal this album is.    After a couple of listens I found that I don't like any other song on the album and even "Breathe" is becoming quite tiresome.  There is no "hidden gem" on this album, just one slightly-less-than-mediocre song after another. "Telepopmusik" is an appropriate name for the band that phoned-in this effort 
 This guy blathers on about how science should be approached from a neutral perspective with an opened mind and without preconceptions.  Fine. Nothing wrong with that. But then he totally contradicts himself by proposing that the basis of scientific investigation should be the supernatural beliefs of one particular Christian sect.  I think aliens came here in UFOS and populated planet earth. They used special ray guns that turned animals into rocks and that's where fossils came from.  Fossils exists don't they?  So there's proof of my alien theory.  It makes just as much sense as "intelligent design".  Hey, the aliens were the "intelligent designers".  That makes sense to me and I have just as much evidence for it as creationist/IDers do for what they propose. I want that taught in schools too. 
 The book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that Michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place. Then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter, "barriers to entry" is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy. This is how the author sets the stage to explain "Competition Demystified"  With this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy, the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis. To simplify things, it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers. This approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book "A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy ". Granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers. But if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables, then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all!. In fact one can say "The end of competition". Kindly recall "The end of history..."  The book however deserves praise for use of  Game Theory in a simple non mathematical approach to analyze competitive situations and the behavior of the players. But again, this approach is just a part of the problem and not a full explanation of competitive strategy.   Given the speed of globalization and technological changes especially the internet in the last decade, the book fails to incorporate such forces that significantly affect the success of global firms.  Too voluminous, and fails to impress on what it sets out to accomplish.  
 ever been talked down to by a person who you know is no smarter than you? that's what this entire book feels like.  Not even amusing enough to try to finish I think that this book may actually be damaging to the reader.  I was hoping for some light hearted fun female-empowered banter and all I found was a book on how to sound shallow and be nice.  
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 i was extremely disappointed with this dvd, in both content and quality.    i expected a wider range of archival video footage from his preformances and some selections are in fact taken from same performances.  fourteen live performace songs is an extreme understatement of his ability to capture his audiences, be it for a television broadcast or live concert.  the anthology is padded with distracting talking head video footage taken from the documentary and the fades between frames were less then desired.  but... the "bonus" documentary was redeeming.  "half mile a day" is definitely the stronger half of this dvd; perhaps the documentary should in fact be the primary material with the anthology being the "bonus" selection.  i ranked this dvd at two stars because i purchased it for the performance footage and not the documentary 
 I did not find the author's arguments for faith to be at all compelling.  Examples used a "evidence" in many instances were simply the opinions of people whom the author interviewed while preparing for the writing of the book.  The case presented was also extremely biased with minimal, if any, counter arguments being presented.  The majority of "experts" interviewed were of the clergy, so how would one expect those people to feel about faith 
 This cd has music that seesaws between pretty and pretty boring...but then you get to the song "Hymn". It is a drop dead, completely gorgeous and jubilant piece of work. As much as the other songs are unimportant, nothing, boring, stereotypcial, new age, synthesizer,  schmaltz, "hymn makes the whole purchase totally worthwhile.   The song is that beautiful 
 This is the worst contempory romance book i have read. The beginning is promising with its opening scene, but from there on its all down hill.  The male protagonist is a likeable character, but as it seems with all of Chris Manby's book the female are either weak, shallow or compleatly stupid!!!!  It does not portray women in the best of lights, and the storyline plods on abysmally, you spend more time reading about the life of the monkies than the romance between the two central characters.   Manby's lead female roles are a poor man's Bridget Jones, and her books seem to follow the same path and sadly the novelty is wearing a little thin.  All i can say is don't waste your day reading this book, i wish i could get back my valuable time!!!!! I would suggest reading Aint she sweet by Susan Elizabeth Philips or Playing James by Sarah Mason 
 As a brazilian animator I tried to start to read this book by the Latin american section, and comprehensively, by the one that shows the status of animation in my country, Brazil, a reality that I know very well.I don't know where Mr. Bendazzi got his informations for this part of the book.What I know is that it's full of strange or, at least unknown names of people for most of the brazilian animators, illustrators figuring as animators, besides the absence of five or six of the really most important animators in my country.Because of all that,I'm affraid the rest of the book, at least in those sections telling about the animation in Latin America still needs to be revised 
 I'm at page 116 right now.  The writing is lovely, the specifics dense, and the sense of place rich.  If the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say, "I just can't go on with this story!" I'm going to throw the book at the wall.  Also, so many embarrassing little holes.  If I were a librarian I would say, "So Dracula's checked out.  Go to a bookstore.  Every bookstore in the country has a copy."  And if I were the cat, I would know I was a goner the second I appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph(you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you're going to fire it).  Lastly, it seems like Dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them.  Unless "Dracula" is related to our heroine--that would be good.  Will read a bit more. . . 
 Uninspired melodies, insipid lyrics.  It all sounds like it came out of a can.  It's hard to believe this is the same artist behind "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy".  This sounds more like bargain basement Celine Dion.  YUCK 
 I bought this book not realizing it was just a condensed version of the author's book Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming.  There is nothing new here except a CD you don't need.  If you are new to ludid dreaming you want to stick to Laberge's previous work.  If you have already read that, you won't need to spend your money on this.  It's like the cliffnotes version with pretty packaging and a CD thrown in to make it sound worth the money.  It's simply not 
 This is an ok book for new people, but it has several safty issues, and doesn't have the show cuts for many dogs, poodles. It also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs. There are better books out there 
 Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.  I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama. 
  This CD is not good, why do people buy junk like that all the time. These remixes are horrible and even the original versions are not that great either. Trash this CD and buy something else. 
 Harold Weisberg stated it best, the Warren Commision Report was a "Whitewash." Keep this fact in mind when you think back to that time in history when Earl Warren was forced by Lyndon Johnson to head the commission to investigate John F. Kennedy's death.(Murder) Earl Warren cried when told by Lyndon Johnson that he had to head the commission. Earl Warren did not want to lead this commission, in fact, he wanted nothing to do with heading the investigation because it meant his good name would be forever associated with a murder, and with the likes of Lyndon Baines Johnson, and his political purposes to cover up the truth of JFK's death! Earl Warren knew all too well what was really going down! Hmmmmmmm....... that's strange, a grown man crying because he's going to be the head of a noble cause? No, he cried because he knew he had to head the commission of a WHITEWASH! Here's what all you naive readers and believers of the Warren Commission Report need to keep in mind.  IF YOU SAY YOU'VE READ THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT, AND BELIEVE WHAT IT SAYS,THEN YOU DIDN'T READ THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT, PERIOD! LOL Common sense would dictate to any intelligent person after reading the Warren Commission report that the truth was not present in this so called investigation from beginning to end based on the real facts! How naive we were then! Never again should we ever as a nation tolerate such manipulation by our goverment officials.  There are so many points in the Warren Commission Report that could be easily shot down, refuted, or proved wrong by either fact,or common sense. Magic bullet theory, HA! That's just what it is, a magic bullet theory, because only a magic bullet could have done what Arlen Spector says this bullet did. Am I right Dr. Henry Lee? I actually advise people to read the WCR, because it is a good starting point for any serious researcher to see how insultuous a document can be to our intelligence as a nation of free people! Bring it on all you non believers 
 What trash! What a paranoid book! A true work of tendentious and speculative fiction disguised as an essay.   No wonder that Amazon stands ready to sell this book for $0.35! Even then, it's a quarter and a half wasted. No wonder also that warmongers Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle gave it a note of thanks. It reads like their own propaganda in their conspiracy to take over American foreign policy and steer it to Israel's favor.  But the Mylroie-Wolfowitz-Perle cabal DID succeed in having the U.S. attack Iraq. This only shows the tremendous importance of propaganda and the strength of the pro-Israel lobby. Nazi Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, would be proud of Laurie Mylroie, since he  once said: "If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it." 
 This was so stupid. Intelligent sharks that swim in schools terrorize a local tourist beach community. Complete with direct rip-0ffs from "Jaws," and combined footage of real sharks with plastic and inflatable toy sharks. Also the shark thinks it's a lion as it growls before and during attacks. People underwater with scuba gear can talk, and scream easily too..Hmmmm..LOL..If you like bad films, you might wanna see how stupid and cheap this is. There is plenty nof unintentional humor here. But I cannot give it any better than 1 star. Because that's what it is. A one star mega low budget film. Bad actors. Bad script. Bad director. Bad special effects. But if you hate bad movies, stay away... Truly for lovers of below "B" grade films only 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 This is, in no way, shape or form, funk!!!  I mean,how the hell is "Another One Bites The Dust" funk?!  My God!!!  This is sure as hell not "Pure Funk", this is soft, white funk!!!  (... 
 This book is so general  that even someone who has never fished would know more already. Some of the information is inaccurate and/or not up to date. The auther has not been even been fishing for what I think is a long time.  He even admits to getting a lot of his info from guides and charters. In fact he talks a lot about all the fish he has cought on the charters and trips he's been on. Anyone can catch fish on a charter. I hope the For Dummies book are not going to all be like this from now on because they are normally very good 
 I bought two of these humidifiers. One for work and one for home. They both broke in the first week 
 I was very disappointed with the ending of this new Danielle Steel.  It seemed like a very long read, with a very quick ending.  I have read every one of her books, and have never been so disappointed with a story until now.  I would not recommend this to anyone 
 Well, there are numerous reasons you wouldn't want to buy this book.  Number one it's shakespear which is literally a different language.  If you're not familiar with it, you will hate this book.  The author did put a page in every other page giving meanings of different texts and terms, though.  The good thing is it reads fast.  And for anyone who thinks comedy.  Not what you're thinkin.  In drama terms a comedy is a play with a happy ending.  A funny play wold be a farse.  Soo it's not really even the least bit funny if that's what ur thinkin.  The book as a whole is pretty short if you take out the definition pages and explanations of different things.  Maybe about a 100.  Really though, unless you have to for school don't waste any time on this book 
  Having seen and enjoyed the movie years ago, I was intrigued to get the whole story.  Books usually tell it so much better.  This one doesn't.  So, if you're looking to read a better version of the movie, this isn't it - go buy the script.    There's no drama, no character development, no humor, no love story!  It's just imagery, imagery, imagery.  BORING.  It was good for putting me to sleep, but that's about it.  Here's the cliffsnotes version of the book:  Two professors go to Italy, buy a house, fix it up, visit it every summer and Christmas and serve lots of dinners to lots of other people, all who have no story to tell either.  You also get a lot of descriptions of doorways and vegetables.  There, you've read it!    Whoever wrote the script for the movie was a genius to find a way to make something interesting out of this SNOOZEFEST!  Save your money, go rent the movie 
 In a time of heady progress in biochemistry and pharmacology, along comes a clinician to tell us once again that addiction is a state of mind that can be cured by correcting skewed thought patterns. In fact, the neuroplasticity of the brain responds to addictive drugs by altering the function of existing neuropathways. Addicted people are different from normal people by virtue of dysfunctions along the serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine "pleasure pathways." The attitudes expressed in this book are at least 15 years out of date, and likely to be of limited use to anyone attempting to free themselves from addiction.    
 Definately his best book to date and written with a real passion for the subject. A must read for anyone interested in this field 
 A friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because I like Cooks Illustrated.  This magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants.  There are so few recipies in it I wouldn't call it a 'cooking' magazine.  What few recipies they do have don't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all.  If you consider yourself a 'foodie' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine, then this magazine might be for you.  If, however, you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it, try Cooks Illustrated instead. 
 Uh, classic or not, I don't care for this book.  It's yet another kill the mom book -just lioke all the disney stuff starts out.  I don't think this is a good choice for today's wee ones.  This is NOT what I'd choose to read at bedtime with my kids at all 
 I have two other books that echo much of the information in this book, so I found the entire book rather repetitious, and the other books I have are much better, more organized and more entertaining. 
 Well if you want to make money by going 'downmarket' and appealing to the teenybopper market and moving away from your traditional market, then this is probably the way to go.  As for musical quality and originality I think this is a poor production.  If you want to listen to a record with some more sensible and poignant lyrics, listen to Rihanna's 'unfaithful 
 The Paleo Diet is based on an interesting premise- the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment. It seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat. Animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time, because their decisions are instinctual. Self-awareness creates a problem that doesn't exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans. Sometimes we do things out of curiosity, or laziness, or false beliefs. So, considering the erratic behavior of present-day humans, who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs? Even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error, frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild.  The fact that wild foods are frequently much richer in nutrients than domestic foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a strict paleolithic diet to take advantage of this fact. Rather, eat more wild-sourced food. Just about anything edible from the wild will be a healthy food, unless the environment from which it comes is polluted- and that is a very real problem.   Meat is a very dodgy thing nowadays, not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the paleolithic era. The Paleo diet would be a healthy thing if we were still in that world. Now, we need to worry about heavy metals in fish flesh, and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals. Beef will have some naturally occuring omega 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less natural fashion, as they did when the most commonly employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy. This is no longer true. The average cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal, fed the wrong food and in conditions unsanitary in the extreme. Basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be dangerous. You must choose your meat sources carefully. Meat made from free-range animals raised on pesticide-free in a caring manner can be very hard to find.   I found Loren's rejection of all products of agricultural development a little too simple minded, and in some cases irresponsible. There is nothing at all unhealthy about whole grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation, and significant weight loss could occur for most people if they ingested organic whole grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the major evil products of agriculture: high fructose corn syrup, trans-fatty acids, artifical sweeteners, uncleaned foods raised non-organically with pesticides and herbicides, and improperly raised food animals.   My main objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages (about half) of the book is dedicated to the spiel- convincing you this thing is real and valid and worth your time. I think the forward to the book or perhaps the first chapter alone would have been sufficient for that purpose. After a while you get the feeling Loren is trying too hard to sell this idea to you, and it really interferes with the flow of the book.  Further, a lot (but not all) of the studies cited show only marginal advantages of different aspects of this diet. The claims that you will experience great weight loss and feel better than you ever have are quite nice to imagine, and peppered throughout the book. But it's hard to believe with the less than overwhelming studies cited.  One last nitpick. One great way to compensate for the lack of typical food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices. something very much like the paleo diet already exists as part of peasant cuisines around the world. It's a pity the recipes included do not explore those, but instead offer somewhat watered down and uninspired fare instead. Espscially asian cuisines frequently make due with alot of the ingredients that are ok on the paleo diet, and their interesting spices make it all the more entertaining. I found the recipes far too traditional and western-centric.  
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 This book is just awful. There are such biased misrepresentations of Christians and the Bible that it would be viewed as bigoted if it were aimed at any other group of people. The Bible is misquoted, taken out of context and generally misapplied. Anyone who chooses to use this as a classroom adjunct should first be mandated to study what the Scriptures really has to say 
 Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book.  Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility.  The title says "interpreting" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution 
 And that's not saying much.  Believe it or not, I actually liked this movie.  Well, to be honest, I liked the concept behind the movie, but this flick otherwise sucked.  The history of the Zodiac Killer as recounted in this movie was almost completely fictitious, and it looked like some of the "crime scene photos" were pulled from a website specializing in gruesome pics (which made the Zodiac Killer seem to be more like the Zodiac Butcher.  He didn't seem to have a problem dismembering his victims in this flick).  There were holes in the plot big enough to drive a truck through.  Simon Vale, the retired Zodiac Killer, wrote a book in the 1970's in which he detailed the life of the Zodiac, and yet it never occurred to anyone how he could possibly have known anything about it.  No one suspected that Vale was the Zodiac Killer despite the intimate details he revealed about his young life that only the Zodiac could possibly have known!  The Zodiac "copycat" (he wasn't really) buys a nerve agent in pill form (at $50 each!), uses it to knock out prospective victims, then kills them.  In one absurd scene, a gasses a pizza delivery girl, decides against killing her, then chows down on the pizza!  In other words, he just blew $50 on a single pizza and didn't even kill anyone!  Riiiiight...  Then we find the Zodiac Killer, who for years never had a problem murdering and butchering his dozens of victims without a second thought suddenly feeling remorse when he sees how a family member of his last victim was traumatized by his crime!  Huh?  Then he turns his back on his evil past, becomes good and writes a book about himself, and no one figures out who he really is?  The cabal of black hooded men are suddenly thrown in for good measure (although I still can't figure out why they're in the movie in the first place), but the gratuitous gay sex scenes left me feeling like I'd accidentally walked into the wrong theater and was watching a cheesy porn flick instead.  The acting was terrible, the dialogue trite, and it looked like it was shot on Lommel's camcorder.  It was especially amusing to see the copycat Zodiac, a good 30-40 years younger then the real Zodiac, suddenly cower in fear when he realized who Simon Vale really was and try to escape, but how often do we see this kind of cliché in the movies where the characters suddenly turn stupid and don't know what to do?  Why he didn't pull his gun or even just punch the old man out is beyond me.  That being said, I liked the idea of the original Zodiac Killer stalking the younger Zodiac "copycat."  It's too bad Lommel otherwise had no clue what he was doing behind the camera.  Give this one a miss 
 No wonder this book has not been translated into Spanish. It would be an absolute fiasco. "The Story of Spain" was so obviously designed to be a good seller among American tourists, that it would make an excellent Hollywood movie -such is the distortion of history!   The author did very little research or none at all, and never submitted the manuscript to the scrutiny of a Spaniard scholar. To prove what I am saying I need only to state that he committed the two most capital of the sins: first, to be wrong about Spain's Saint Patron; and second, to mix up the most precious symbol of hispanidad.   In page 44 you can read: "Popular legend says that Saint James the Elder (Santiago), believed to be half-brother  of Jesus, brought Christianity to the peninsula around AD 40."   Some confusion has arisen over the identity of James, the Lord's brother, who was not one of the original twelve apostles, and St. James, son of Alpheus, also known as James the Less. Neither of them is Spain's Patron Saint. In about AD 44 King Herod Agrippa I beheaded the Apostle St. James, James the Great, son of Zebedee and St. John's the Evangelist's brother. This is the one we venerate. Every Spanish man, every Spanish woman, knows the difference. Ask them.  As for the symbol of hispanidad, there is one Virgin of Guadalupe whose statue lays in a monastery near Caceres, Spain. There is another Virgin of Guadalupe, with no relation whatsoever to the first one, whose picture was, according to tradition, miraculously imprinted on an Indian's cape, that of san Juan Diego. This picture (not a statue) can be seen at a Basilica in Mexico City. The latter was declared "Queen of the Americas" by the Catholic Church. Most Latin Americans don't even know that the first one exists, let alone that She is "the symbol of hispanidad". 
 This was the worst waste of money I ever spent. All of the short, simple "tips" are self-explanatory; I can't even imagine anyone over the age of 9 not already knowing them. Unless you spend most of your spare time mugging people, I can't imagine that it would add anything to your life. I would very strongly suggest that you save your money and skip this one.  YUCK 
 What a disappointment!  It sure looks like there's a good mystery in this book somewhere but digging through all the detail and ploding style is just too much.  A great read if you're looking to become an insurance claims adjuster 
 As a begining ESL teacher without training in this area, I was looking for a book that included practical advice,such as needs assessments, lesson/unit plans, etc. Many reviews lead you to believe that this is a great overall book that includes these things, but it is not! This book is a text book for a "Teaching ESL" class.  All theory with almost NO practical purpose.  If you are interested in language acquisition theory etc., then this may be the book for you, but if your looking for a book to help you teach an ESL class - don't waste your money. I'm very sorry I did. 
 I couldn't disagree more heartily with those who recommended this book as a "beautiful coffee table book." At this price and with this subject matter this could have been a truly amazing look at the history of the House of Chanel and it's transition from the early years of Coco to the present leadershiop of Karl Lagerfeld. The text is mediocre and the photos are terrible. The general visual quality of the book is absolutely reprehensible.The dresses are all reproduced in a poor quality "Liz Taylor in the White Diamonds commercial" fake fuzzy lens. There is not one really great photo of an actual garment in this entire book. As someone who saw the actual exhibit the book is based on, I feel the Metropolitan really missed on this one. The exhibit itself was magnificent, this poorly concieved book is a complete dud. Save your money for one of the many other books detailing the life and work of Coco Chanel 
 It seems only to have occurred to a few of these reviewers that whatever Foucault intended as the poltical upshot of Discipline and Punish (and are we even 'allowed' to ask such a question?) its practical political effect has been to allow senior academics a face-saving way to warn graduate students not to rock the boat while denying any authoritarian tendencies.  Perhpas Foucault's work has somehow had more positive political effects in gay rights work, and I would be interested in hearing that argument, but I doubt it.  I think his celebrity has done that 
 The actual bag itself was great.  However, the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not.  I ordered this bag and three weeks later it came.  I had to go buy a bag to take on vacation.  kind of defeated the purpose 
 This music is a rip off. All is borrowed to the 4 first albums of Marc Bolan playing under the name of Tyranosaurus Rex. Something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy.  A shame 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 man abuses our environment  there, now you dont have to sit throug 400 pages of ranting about how statistics are proving we destroy our environment.  If you need this book to realize we are a destructive race; well then maybe you should read it, its so repetative you are bound to get the idea 
 I'm of a mixed mind about this book.  On the one hand, it struck me as sensational rather than scholarly, and written for a younger, more impressionable crowd (probably the same target audience that loves the oh-so-goff "Gothic Grimoire" and so forth).  The basic historical research about vampires is decent, though nothing you couldn't find in any other book about vampire lore. Again, my common gripe about occult nonfic is present (or not)--the lack of in-text citations. The bibliography actually had some surprising inclusions--Franz Bardon's "Initiation in Hermetics" being notable in that respect.  It's when the author gets into modern-day vampires that things get a little weird.  Now, in his defense, he does explain that he did get some rather....err...strange letters, usually by people who were obviously ganking their life-history from fictional sources, and so these weren't quoted. Even the letters that were quoted, though, for the most part struck me as a little ungrounded (is there any vampire who doesn't write with a melodramatic air?)  Now, he printed some of the letters, but gave little feedback on them. I think what he was tying for was a "You decide" kind of thing, but it came off more as "I'm not going to deny them because I ant you to think they're real". Just IMO, of course.  To his credit, he does go into the physical dangers of blood drinking. Most people these days are aware of blood diseases, but I got a little chuckle at the idea of someone ruining their cape after discovering that enough blood will make one vomit.  He's got an odd POV on psychic vampirism, in that all "intentional" psi-vamps are noncorporeal, and any corporeal psi-vamps are "unintentional" (ie, have no idea what they're doing.)  However, also keep in mind that when the book was first written in 1996, the internet wasn't nearly as prevalent, and so the main way to get ahold of those claiming to be vampires was through Fangoria magazine and related venues. There weren't scads of websites created by psychic and sanguine vampires telling it like it is.  Personally, there's a part of me that thinks that Konstantinos wrote everything he did (except for Summoning Spirits, which I very much enjoyed) with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. I think he hit on a particular untapped target audience, found just the right books to toss at them, and is now laughing all the way to the bank. It's not that he's not serious about what he's doing, but there's an element of the Trickster here as well.  At any rate, "Vampires: The Occult Truth" is an average book with some flaws. There are better books on the topic that have come out since then, but it was what it needed to be when it came out. Maybe a revision will make it more up to date 
 by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit Pollard's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might. And while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion, (i.e. swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century) Pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of Christian virtue. This is basically saying Christians have lost a culture war without explaining why.   While the initial exposition on what the parameters of Christian modesty mean Pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of Christian modesty would be. Furthermore, when push comes to shove he refers to the Westminster Larger Catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused. Some of his cases are self-defeating. On one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century.  Props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting.  On the other hand, it's cheap so if you're not persuaded the research has been effective it won't cost you much 
 This is so far one of the most boring Nora Roberts books, ever.  It was OK but it seriously was a PUSH to get through it, and usually I simply just fly through her novels.  The characters are very flat and uninvolved.  I was able to guess whodunit way before the act was even done, as well as guess some of the plot twists.  The book was fun for the trip to Hollywood-land but besides that it was a LONG book (528 pages) that really would have been better off slimmed down.  Lots ado about nothing which leads to boring repeat events and pointless happenings that in the end you discover served no purpose at all to the story.  If you are a NR fan, you may like it but I suggest perhaps finding another novel to read first and borrow this one from a friend.  
 Firstly, I'm a huge fan of Jackie Chan and his work, but I just can't give this movie a good review. It is one of the most depressing films I've seen. Basic plot synopsis; Jackie has to watch all of his team members be executed, he is given an opportunity to save each one and fails each time. So thats the first 20 or 30 minutes of the film and all his closest friends are dead. The next portion of the film deals with him trying to drink himself to death. Then we watch his relationship with his fiance fall apart. Then we get to see one of the gang members being abused by his father. and thats at least two thirds of the film.   And then there's the whole subplot about the gang members making a video game out of all the people they kill so the good guys have to play the game in order to figure out what bank they're going to rob next. Kind of cheesy.  As I said, I really like Jackie Chan and he does display some really good acting talent in this film. But I don't like waiting until the last 20 minutes of the movie to see some good action and fight scenes especially when I just had to sit through some of the most depressing stuff I've ever seen 
 This book alleges that about US$2.5 billion worth of German treasure (in gold and various currencies valued in 1983 or 1984 dollars) was stolen at the end of WW II, the overwhelming majority of which was purportedly stolen by Soviets or Nazis before there was any American involvement (apart from participating in the aerial bombing of Berlin).  But, the book lavishes attention almost only on (i) the part allegedly stolen with American complicity and (ii) alleged crime and corruption in the American-controlled post-war Bavaria.  But here is the kicker.  The book is horrendously disorganized, full of repetitions, stuffed with "teasers" such as on local news shows, and replete with innuendo (sometimes even contradicted within the book itself), and its deus ex machina is "cover up."  Maybe the alleged thefts and crimes did occur, and maybe Sayer and Botting stumbled onto a story which could have been interesting.  Unfortunately for this reader, Sayer and Botting did not deliver on their promise to tell us what did happen to the treasure (other than purportedly disappearing) and what they did tell, they told poorly.  My comments relate to the 1984 (or is it 1985?) version of the book. I do not know if there is a newer, improved version of the book.  If there isn't, I'd recommend spending your time and money elsewhere 
 Tamar Myers has too many sidelines in this book. Too much about too many  other characters and not enough attention paid to the real mystery in  question. I found this book an entanglement of Magdelena's relationships  (good and bad ones) and the history connected with each one. This book was  a downer 
 "Think Tank" reinvented Blur for me, or my view of their previous material.  I like Blur.  I can't say that they are my favorite band -- but they definitely have a place of their own in my collection, especially albums # 2-4 (Modern Life..., Parklife, and Great Escape).  The unabashed use of pop to convey anti-pop messages.  The sarcastic storytelling.  Blur was a good time party band that could also engage anyone who actually sits down and listens to the words........ more than meets the eye.  That was something to be proud of.    I started to like Blur less the more sophisticated and artistic they got.  I didn't like Blur (self-titled album) much, with the direction of the songwriting..... and I really disliked 13......... but just the same, I oddly respect these albums, as they live and breathe, even if they are over-ambitious and/or less accessible.  If Damon Albarn wants to "grow up" as a songwriter, he has that right........ even at the expense of "alienating" fans like myself.  Whatever it was he was going for, he seemed to hit it right between the eyes.    And then came Think Tank.  Instrumentally and stylistically, this was a natural progression from the increasingly more-serious last two albums.  More computers are used.  More instruments are experimented with.  The songs are less direct, more searching.  All the pieces are in place for a solid, if not as listenable, neo-Blur album.  Which would be admirable, even if non-adaptable people like me do not like it as much.  That's Fine............. the only problem is: it's not solid, and not listenable.     And thus I came upon the revelation of what made Blur "Blur"............. Of course. It was the one palpable thing missing from Think Tank that everything else before it had had.  The only thing that could explain going from good experimentation to aimless experimentation.  The guitar.  The guitar was gone.  The abstract, vernacular lead guitar........ hard to describe but impossible to mistake.  Ladies in gentlemen, what made Blur "Blur" was Graham Coxon, I reckon...   Without Coxon, Think Tank loses focus and musicality both.  Albarn and the rhythm section are left making music that sounds like it were generated by "Garage Band" or a similar computer program.  For most of the songs, there is no distinguishing one part from another.  It literally sounds as though Albarn and the band could have played the hook once and just looped it the rest of the song.  The samples are promising but the songs are basically Gorillaz clones: beat-driven, without melody or variation.  Nothing to even make them worth listening to, unless the lyrics grab you............. and the lyrics are not bad, which makes the ineptitude of the music even more unfortunate.    Think Tank could have been a very good album.  Some of the songs are catchy and border on good. "Out of Time" is very pretty. "Good Song" is a drone's lazy summer hymn. "Sweet Song" is a basic but convincing little ballad. "On My Way to the Club" is a possessed reflection on rock and roll trappings.  Albarn shows that he has grown up into quite the sociopolitical visionary, actually.  He lyrics have an abstract depth that make them worth studying.  But the songs are still skeletons, barely even real songs -- even these borderline-good ones.  And sadly, this drags the poetic prowess down with it.    Not much need be said about the songs I did not mention.  Most drag on like jam sessions to nowhere, as Damon tries to be understated and thus nothing gets stated, since if not words, the music certainly isn't going to say it.  When they finish one almost feels cheated for having listened to them expecting something to happen.  There is one exception. "Battery in Your Leg." This is the one very good song on the album........ it is no coincidence that it also is the only song that features Graham Coxon.  It is almost too ironic that Albarn apparently finished with this song as a message to Coxon that the two could reconcile.  On a musical level, this song says even more: they need to reconcile.    Blur's career may depend on it.  In essence, this song takes the same kind of songwriting from the rest of the album and gives it melody and direction.  What actually makes the song, in fact, is Coxon's eerie descending chord progression after Albarn's sincere "You can be with me"... plummeting right into Alex James' base.  The end result is pretty breathtaking... even for someone who likes recent Blur less than old Brit-pop Blur.  When Albarn's imagination and Coxon's flare come together, good things still happen..........  But while Coxon's vibrant guitar-playing can stand alone, as his solo works prove, Albarn needs Coxon badly.  Likely more than Coxon needs him.  Albarn is a freewheeler without the musical aptitude to make his idea's work......... and Coxon is his structure.  In accommodating Coxon, Albarn actually accommodates himself...... and what he is capable of.  That didn't happen on Think Tank.  
 Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.   Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.  The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us 
 This book was written ( I bet)by unpaid graduate assistants. I borrowed it from the library to read before mr Fukuyama's arrival to speak at a university. The book was "written to order" to appeal to American conservatives. If Mr Fukuyama had really wanted to write about the construction/maintenance/increasing/decreasing of TRUST he could not have pointedly ignored the European Union. Nations and peoples with a thousand or more years of organised warfare are now at peace and trying to work together now that's an exercise in TRUST BUILDING. I asked Mr Fukuyama why, as the book doesn't have America in the title, did he only mention distrust in medieval Italy and not the phenominal TRUST required to bring Germans, Brits and the French together. His reply "Oh .. people always want me to talk about their country. Next question." well!.... I feel that this book is a dis service to Americans because as with so many political/cultural and economic books from the USA what is left out of the book adds to the hurly burly spiral of disinformation accepted as the truth about the world by many Americans and esp. uncrital conservatives. I am, of course by my own reckoning, a conservative - a mixed economy democratic christian from the U.K.(OK OK New Labour) So I am not hostile to the US, but this type of book and the supportive reviews sadden me. Good luck America and PLEASE read wider and TRAVEL 
 I was so anxious to get this and when I finally did, my daughter was just  not that interested with it. She barely plays with it. I was hoping that with this she would spend  more time on her tummy because she normally hates that. Maybe that's why she didn't care much for this. 
 This book is a total bore. Only a couple of pages that holds your attention. More talk about the scenery and walking naked through the woods. Don't waste your time 
 I purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th Grade. I am very glad that I read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it. This book is about gang violence (although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders.)  The book is also about angry, jaded, hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes.   The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)   Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.   The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is. Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)  I knew that it was questionable whether or not I would allow my son to read this book.  I read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book.  There isn't.   This is the first book that I have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else. Save your money.  I don't care how many awards this book received.  It is pure trash 
 I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking.  The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides.  Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone.  Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field 
 This girl didn't really do anything that bad. And it was just unrealistic with the whole parenting situation 
 I was looking forward to this item, but I was sent the cheaper, non-organic version twice.  Amazon informed me that they couldn't guarantee when the problem would be fixed.  If someone orders this and gets the organic version, please post.  I'd love to buy these in the future!  
 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 I'm not sure how to refer to song which happens to contain the name of the band.  I'd call it the title track but that's what you call a song that shares the album title, not the band name.  Anyways, "Adiemus" is the catchiest song on here and nothing else comes close except for "Kayama" which just sounds like it's trying to copy "Adiemus".  I'm aware that this isn't really the type of music that's supposed to have catchy songs but even background music should have a sense of being able to stand alone.  Other songs such as "In Caelum Fero" and "Amate Adea" have great beginnings but don't go anywhere positive and that's saying something for the former seeing as how it's an 11 minute song.  The only other song that's holding this together is the ending "Hymn" which is okay but seems like more of an interlude.  If you're looking for New Age music, you can do better than this 
 It is not the book I thought it would be.  Sorry I brought it 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty  sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist 
 At first I was not aware of the author's point of view. He has spent extensive time in China and Tibet, and has witnessed many of the upheavels. However, I was amused at first at the innaccuracy of much of his  information, and then became disappointed, as I realized that he rather  strong anti-religious bias. This bias is not conducive to understanding any  aspect of Tibetan life and culture. I would advise against reading this  book unless you are curious of the official stance of the Chinese Communist  Party 
 This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998!!!  Totally out of date! Useless!! Wondering why it is still for sale.  The author, contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked, simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one...  Outrageaous!  Spread the word and if you own the book, get your money back 
 The ideas are trite, the prose is pre-sophomoric, and the little introductions by the author that precede each story are nauseatingly self-centered. One of them (preceding "Shadow of the Mothaship") says: "The way I write stories is really stupid [...]". Hear, hear! I can't imagine why Bruce Sterling endorsed this puerile effluvium 
 I got my bottle of Curve today and tried it out...  My girlfriend said I smelled like dust.  Oops!  Too bad they don't have scratch and sniff on the computer.. 
 Keegan started out years ago with a bang with The Face of Battle, in which the post-Vietnam and, for the UK, a post-Empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history.  This early promise has NOT been fulfilled, and Keegan has declined considerably in quality because he's become co-opted by the Establishment, a post-Empire, Blair establishment every bit as corrupt as Haig.  Keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the 1980s that the "tempo" of the next war (which as a Sandhurst insider he was probably planning) be increased to 24/7. In this, he gave NO consideration to the high levels of post-traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the US policy of "no sleep until Baghdad" in the second Iraq war.  Keegan is post-Sixties, all right, but instead of peace and love, he's a Nietzchean who'd wage war with the poor man's body.  His "war" is chateau generalship by the rich, actually fought, 24/7, by British working class lads, blackfellows from Britain's few remaining colonies, and of course Americans.  Keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie, subtly and over time, dulce et decorum. Precisely by foregrounding war's utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and ONCE AGAIN a test of manhood, and this has gotten people killed.  His book on Military Intelligence managed, idiotically, to dismiss MI as secondary and not critical precisely, almost to the day, when the American and British MI was declaring victory (remember Mission Accomplished?) and failing to see how disbanding the Iraqi army would create the insurgency.  The Iraq War recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it, or the Iraqis brutalized. At key points, it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of Iraqis to greet their "liberators" which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science.  Ignore all writings by John Keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at Sandhurst. For a good history of the Iraq War cf. Thomas E. Ricks, THE IRAQ WAR 
 I just got a 2006 version of math blasters, I played it for a while and I thought that it was really frustrating and it didnt help me at math at all! I think that anyone who plays it will probably fall right to sleep when they start playing! The box it came in said it was for age 6-12 but I think it is for 6 or 7 year old kids. I really dont think this is a good game to play 
 Title is self explanatory, I'm very busy to write reviews but I needed to make this one, make sure nobody gets fooled by brand name , at medium prices and ultra low quality. I've bought a 5$ nobrand knife from TOP and is WAY better that this 
 Well, now this carry case is a goner.  The latch will no longer close and the top rim is hopelessly bent.  It was fun while it lasted 
 This was one of the few books I just could not get through. Managed about 2/3 and just gave up. At least to the point where I called it quits, the plot was just goofy. 
 This was my first book I read by Gertrude Stein, and frankly, it will probably be my last.  Her subject matter is bland and uninteresting.   I understand her rejection of conventional prose, and she does have a unique  style of writing, but I just don't like it.  I can understand and  appreciate why she wrote it the way she did, but it barely kept my  attention.  And her use of stereotypes was extremely blatant 
 This book is neither good contents nor sharp predicts. What is this book?  I think it is just garbage. If you want get more information for your future life and your future business, it is better that you need to read Toefler's work, The Revolutionary Wealth. Naisbitt is not present man any more. He is the past man!!!   
 I havent listened to these guys since vaseline way back in the early 90's........after reading rave reviews about this album, here on amazon, i had to see what the fuss was about...  The first couple of tracks are ok.....especially the first one, that is the best song off the album....as i got further down the trackilisting, they start to all sound the same....  how about the singer, if my memory is correct, he is that crazy looking clown like idiot with huge red puffy hair.....  i think his voice is so stupid, its not even funny.....oh and the lyrics, come on now.....they are ABSOLUTELY ridiculous  If you consider yourself as one of those worm type little people, that rootes for guys like roger from the nerds.....this is your type of music... 
 This movie is very difficult to watch after awhile. Its about a psycho boss but its not funny at all. I didn't laugh through any of the movie. I love dark comedies like election, heathers, to die for, etc but this just didn't work for me. I hated it so much I returned it (lied and said it was a gift). Don't even rent it horrendous 
 The Psycho Realm sounds like a cross between Cypress Hill and the Gravediggaz.  At first many of the eerie beats are catchy, but too many of the songs sound similar and soon the novelty gets old.  Not a bad debut, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone unless they are a huge fan of B Real and the Hill 
 The plot of the story is Ludlum all the way, but the narrative is no where near Ludlum. I am having a hard time getting through it. Will probably give up before half way 
 I really didn't enjoy this book. I can't really say why because it will spoil it for some people. I was just very dissapointed and felt the story could have been great. 
 "A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented 
 Absolutley no help for the lazy students, this book is filled with foolish stratigies that only help semi-enthused students make class more enjoyable. The techniques found in the book require at a fair amount of interest in a class. In no way could this book help a student that isnt motivated to work in school. For example, the first section is filled with ways to con a teacher into devoting their time into a mindless/useless class discussion. In what way is this motivating 
 I can just imagine the writer's thought-process:  "Let's see, we've got massive tornados in L.A., tidal wave engulfing NYC, an almost immediate deep-freeze that kills instantly, and a sick character who needs medication or she will die, what could make this better?  Wolves!  Yes, we need escaped wolves."  Sheesh.  If anyone thinks the CGI effects in this movie are fabulous, they've obviously never seen a real wolf.  Those things weren't even close.    Oh, and let's not forget the zoo that keeps the bears, sheep, and wolves right next to each other in a small building.  Riiight.    I spent most of the movie either laughing at the absurdity of the scenario, and getting nauseated by the "sentimental" scenes.   I'm not even going to go into the horrible plot, cliches galore, and all of the other just plain wrong things about this movie.  I'm not going to touch on the overt environmental and political messages that probably did more damage to real and important climate concerns - since from the reviews it seems some people actually believed this was even remotely plausible, while others used it to deepen their hatred of "greenies".    Don't waste your time with this one.  There are far better movies of this genre.  And there are far better ways to learn about global warming.  
 Comedy comes in many forms--everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire--and in "Just Friends" there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types.  First, the movie wants to be a gross-out comedy.  The sight gags are plentiful, the physical comedy abundant and often cruel, and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic.  However, the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy--the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart.  These elements have been combined successfully in the past--"There's Something About Mary" jumps right to mind.  Here, we get something far less successful.  First, the good news.  There are legitimate laughs to be had in "Just Friends" and that was a pleasant surprise.  If you don't care about character development and just want inane humor, you could do worse than this movie.  And if the sight of Ryan Reynolds in a fat suit sounds like the height of hilarity to you--check this out right away.  Sadly, it's the romantic comedy angle that fails to ignite.  There is nothing real at stake here to care about--and the blame for this falls squarely on Reynolds' character (I'll use the word character lightly here).  Reynolds may be one of our greatest sitcom actors working--the problem, however, is that he's not in sitcoms anymore.  He's making movies, unfortunately--and his hamming up to the camera always seem to take the place of a real character.  Here, he plays a celebrity insider--a successful, trendy record executive.  And yet, he's not believable as trendy, successful or professional.  His character vacillates between being the a villain and a hero, you never know or understand him--he just does whatever is necessary to set up the next gag.  It's too bad, really, because Amy Smart--as his love interest--IS playing a character.  I'm not usually a fan, but here she does nicely and the movie lets her down.  But it's Anna Faris that I'm going to single out for the most inspired performance.  The funniest bits to me revolve around her character--a shallow, insane pop star.  Sure, it's an easy target--but she throws herself into the role with such hilarious, over-the-top gusto that she is easily a cast standout.  Again, some humor--no emotion.  If you don't expect much from your comedy, you might just like this.  The fatal flaw for me is that I felt this film wanted me to care about the central relationship, but didn't do anything to make it REAL. 
 This book underestimates the intelligence of reader, oversimplifies, and offends.  I recommend Dixit and Nalebuffs' "Thinking Strategically", which is infinitely better; or if you are not afraid of elementary algebra, the classic Luce and Raiffa "Games and Decisions" published in 1957 and now available as a Dover edition. 
 more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc 
 Definitely must be a children's book. Written by a child for a child with absolutely no life experience.  I read many books of many genres and this book is completely and utterly boring...Maybe he puts together some fancy little one liners and a couple of odd pairing of words. This is definitely not a timeless novel. Not a book I would recommend wasting your time on. Sadly my boyfriend recommended this book to me and I am quite disappointed at his lack of taste and style. My imagination needs a bit more colors than this. Anyone who can rave about this book has absolutely no clue about art or true writing. It is rigidly boring and a pretentious piece of writing. I don't see how anyone can waste there time on this book...It is really very pathetic and disturbing. 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 new york city used to be cool, yeah.  if i'd gotten this album when it came out i might be saying the same thing about sonic youth!!  then i might not have looked into murray st. and sonic nurse.  i, um, showed up a little late so instead of toyning me off to the band it just sort of collects dust on the shelf.  oh well 
 This is another Hollywood costume epic. They spared no expense with the set and costumes, hired talented big name actors Rex Harrison, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive.   Harrison was terrific as Gaius Julius Caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and Richard Burton does not come across as a great Mark Antony. His character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by Cleopatra, Antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked?    Although the film is titled Cleopatra, it focuses more on the historic events.  The film also reduces Cleopatra to the woman depicted in Octavian's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent, a gifted political strategist, expert linguist, dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty.  They don't give you sense of what was so compelling about Cleopatra.   She is depicted as a combative shrew with both Caesar and Antony. I doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man. If you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here?  I would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as Roman military leaders and the weak position of Egypt compared to Rome.  Given the limitations of their vision of Cleopatra Liz Taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish, beautiful, seductive and glamorous temptress; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance.   Although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you can't deny Taylor's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material.  Although Taylor shines sadly we never get to know Cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed Hollywood costume drama.   This movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50's and sixties - the style reminds me of DeMille films like The Ten Commandments. It did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of Taylor and Burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit.    The research, writing and the Directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama.  The real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great. 
 not what i was expecting at all - i should have returned it - not the seller's fault of course - just not what i thought it was  
 We design custom homes and sell a custom component package to customers in the USA.  About 15% of my customers are owner contractors and I have worked with over 50 owner builders in the past ten years. This book is deceptive in that it exaggerates the potential savings and downplays the potential pitfalls. A typical custom home contractor has a 15% profit margin based on National Home Builders Association reports, I concur with that as well. Saving 25% is a dream unless you not only act as the contractor but do much of the work yourself. For every successful owner built project I see there are 5 that are a complete fiasco.  Unless you have considerable carpentry and building experience, know how to deal with subcontractors and all the pitfalls of working with them, and have full time to devote to you homebuilding project then don't even attempt to build your own house! Keep your sanity and marriage intact and hire a good contractor.  My experience with owner builders is that they don't know how to negotiate with the trades, they are unaware of the workmans comp insurance and lien pitfalls and in many cases they pay the subcontractors more than they should because of their inexperience.  Save the cost of this book and go to a movie instead.  Unless you are the unusual one in ten owner builder who has all the right skills and the personality to handle a difficult learning curve you would be well advised to look elsewhere for saving money, perhaps building a slightly smaller house with a contractor  would be a wiser option and in most cases the contractor built house will be much better built and worth much more money when all is said and done.  Spend some time doing research on the web about being your own contractor and read about all the horror stories.  You don't make your own car, sew your own clothes, grow your own food, or assemble your television. Use good common sense and realize that owner building you home is a crap shot at best and a personal and financial catastrophe at worst.  The best thing I can say about this book is that it will give you a good overview of the process of homebuilding but it will in no way equip you for the realities of building your own home. There is no substitute for long term experience, this book makes a toad look like a prince, pretty far fetched in my experience 
 The main thesis of Ordering Your Private World is that all of life should be planned and managed, eliminating the false dichotomy between the secular and sacred. The book is organized into four sections. And each of the fourteen chapters is prefaced with a "Memo to the Disorganized."  Gordon MacDonald has been a pastor and in the leadership of World Vision and InterVarsity. So he clearly has some significant gifts in leadership. But it was only a few years after publishing Ordering Your Private World, that he had an affair, according to the Washington Post . So it seems it was precisely in his "private world", where MacDonald has failed the most.  This leads me to question if spiritual success has very much to do with organization and planning. That being said, to look at a moral failure as invalidating all of MacDonald's work would be fallacious. His moral failure could in fact be due to not practicing what he literally wrote the book on. At the very beginning of the book he says:  "Slowly and sometimes painfully, I have discovered that to bring organization to the private world Christ chooses to live is both a lifelong and a daily matter. Something within - the Bible calls it sin - resists both His residence and all of the resulting order. It prefers a disorder where wrong motives and values can be hidden away and drawn to the surface in unguarded moments" (8).  Planning, measurement, and follow through are often keys to success in business. It makes some sense to apply these principles to our whole lives. But this is a very Western perspective. In an event oriented culture, where relationships are much more important than getting things done, one might need to spend all day sitting around, talking and eating to get to the ten or fifteen minuets of "real business."  Another issue that MacDonald doesn't address the fact that for a very structured, planned and scheduled life to be comfortable, has as much to do with personal temperament as it does with discipline. He's correct in saying that most people do exercise this discipline in their work. But they do so out of necessity, based on how Western business works.   It seems that the private world should be personal. We need spiritual disciplines for sure. But they should become part of who we are.  They should fit with our cultural orientation and with our temperament 
 First off, I usually just stick to rating & critiquing movies. But, every time I see an ad on this website for this Time/Warner (or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week) rag-mag I start to see red.  "Entertainment Weekly", which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life, has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash.     Back in the summer of 89, "EW" was released and after I read a few issues, I decided to subscribe. I was instantly hooked (the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the Saturday before it would hit regular newstands) & I liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies, music, T.V., and video (that was later added in the mid-90's).   The problem with the magazine started in the late 90's. I started to notice that "EW" would cover a big movie or event that hadn't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it, or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales.   I also hate the damn lists that "EW" comes up with. The latest entitled "The top 100 most memorable movie lines" was a joke. These lists have always annoyed me, because I feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking.  The other & most important thing I noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review.   Case in point, a few weeks ago I picked up the latest issue in which the movie "Catwoman" had been reviewed (I wasn't to sure if it was Gleiberman or Shwarzbaum that critiqued it).   I first logged onto "Rotten Tomatoes.com" to see what percentile "Catwoman" recieved from the nation's critics.  Out of roughly 115 reviews "Catwoman" only got 10% of the good reviews while the rest trashed it (a film needs, at least, to get a grade of 60 - 65% in order to place it as a fresh or good movie). That makes "Catwoman" the worst reviewed film, so far, for 2004. Yet, "EW" gave the film a B. What erkes me even more is that "Catwoman" is released by "Warner Bros.", the same company that owns the rights to the "Harry Potter" films, "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, & yes, the "WB" owns "Entertainment Weekly".   Is "Warner Bros." trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular & lucrative magazine's?         I'm not the only who has seen this developement. People have written in saying that there is favoritism among "Warner" products that are reviewed in the magazine. "EW", of course, hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews, possibly in fear of being fired (they will deny that also).  My only question to the reviewers at "Entertainment Weekly" is, "Whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it?"   Or better yet, "What's it like to stand on a Democratic Podium?" 
 Even though I own most of the "Poirot Offerings" starring David Suchet owing to my affinity for Agatha Christie's work,I still maintain that "Peter Ustinov" is by far more at home in "Poirot's" shoes as evident by his inimitable performences as the belgian eccentric/sleuth over the years.particularly in the "Death on the Nile"(1978).And having said that, the latest addition to A&E's Poirot caper of the same name featuring Suchet is unfortunately "Toothles and Meandering" at best.In short,If you already own the Original ( Ustinov )version,then don't even bother spending your hard-earned on this trite 
 I would not advise buying this book for studying for the SCEA exam. It is very badly written and not clear at all. Much of the material is repeated and long-winded. It contains some of the most useless diagrams I've seen in a long time. I would recommend the Mark Cade book and some of the notes and files that are available from other people who sat the exam. (mainly from the Yahoo groups and JavaRanch). The good points of the book are that there are plenty of practice questions and a sample exam.  
 This book is indeed scholarly but to whom?  Much of the data is concerning useless facts.  It is not intended to inform of the Black Death as I thought it would.  There are no scientific facts written; only boring useless facts of land ownerships and church renovations and construction.  I have gained nothing from this book 
 In need of a fun, adventure read, I picked up an author I always seem to see on the shelves - Cussler. It was a fun, easy read, but I expected better from such a prolific author. This is a book I would have loved when I was 14 years old, but have now come to a be a bit more demanding of realism. I found the syntax and grammar of the narrator to be very poor, which detracted from the book tremendously - I was left wondering if the editor just rubber-stamped this one.  My main issue with this book was the sci-fi level of belief suspension needed to get through it *Spoilers*: 1) fully functioning artificial intelligence robots able to carry out casual conversations, circa 1993  2) Japan has secretly created a perfect missile defense program  3) an adventurer/underwater researcher sent in to take down a heavily defended fortress, instead of a trained team of SEALs/Delta/etc. 4) That a Japanese tycoon created over 100 nukes from one salvaged "Fat Man" atomic bomb from 1945.  5) That a super-secure vault would have a convenient ventillation duct large enough for a man to squeeze through.  6) Robots that drive cars 7) several ridiculously convenient coincidences that save the day  8) the usual near death witty comment, etc...  all in all, kind of fun, but don't think much or you'll ruin the plot. 
 This book is awful given its horrible and out of date questions, which are NOTHING like the real SAT II questions.  Also, the history is written in a very (VERY) baised view, with almost NO soical history (35% of the SAT II should be soical history).  Lastly, I am not sure if the authors are NRA members or something, but the overall sense I felt after reading the histor review was that anything liberal is bad and President Bush is the greatest president ever.  Buy a better book, go for the Kaplan or the Princeton Review.  P.S. I got a 790 on my SAT II US History by *not* using this book.  This book might actually drag your score down 
 Don't waste your time with this, folks. This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film "Graffiti Bridge."   But if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet-shooting, then go for it 
 The newest version of Arena is 5.0 . This book teaches based on the version 3.0 
 I consider large parts of this book as just a re-hash of earlier works by this author. If you know the earlier works, I am afraid there is not much added value for your money 
 It has some funny moments but it's certainly not Pratchett's best. As crazy and sometimes corrupt Hollywood is it's not the sort of industry where Cthulu would be comfortable. The combination just doesn't make sense. And then there's the talking dog. On about every fifth page Pratchett stops the plot (what little of one there is) to do yet another talking dog joke 
 This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you. My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item.  Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it. I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper) Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it. I don't think no one will die from this type of trick 
 A lot of reviewers commend this book for the quantity and intensity of its action. That's true; they are both in abundance. However, the writing is terrible, the characters are severely lacking in depth, and much of what transpires is well beyond plausibility. I know thrillers aren't supposed to be entirely realistic, but this book is so beyond the realm of possibility that reading it becomes a frustrating exercise. I'm not sure why I bothered to finish it - definitely one of the worst books I've ever read 
 The light-hearted descriptions of the contributors makes this an entertaining read- and more interestingly contributor Shauna Marsh's popular online [...] reveal  the simultaneously secretive and extroverted  dual-identity of a blogger for whom weight loss is both a public and private journey.  Like her blogs, her contribution to this book is filled with anecdotes full of personal triumphs and humorous mishaps but overall I found the authors of book more self-obsessed than inspirational 
 I've been a Heinlein fan for a long time.  My problem with this book is that it is not what it purports to be: a book in the Heinlein style, written as a collaboration between Heinlein and Robinson posthumously.  If he wanted to do a Heinlein book, Robinson should have done two things that he did not do:   1) eliminate, almost without fail, every single vulgarity or swear-word in the book, and  2) not directly related elements within the book to our "real world".  Every time I saw a swear word I was reminded that this was not Heinlein.  (I am hardly prudish, but I know the Master could write about things such as polyamorous bisexual group sex between related people, or convey absolute disgust and hatred, without once using Anglo-Saxon terminology).  Every time I saw him talk about 9/11 or Star Wars in the context of future history, I was reminded that this was not Heinlein.  The real disappointment is that Spider //should know better//.  Was he trying to put his mark on the book with those swear words?  How could he not know that these would be jarring to those who were looking for Heinlein? 
 TALKING ABOUT A MISSCAST. SAMUEL JACKSON CAN PORTRAY A HITMAN, A PIMP OR A THIEF, BUT A PHARMACOLOGICAL GENIUS, YEAH, RIGHT 
 I purchased this one only out of curiosity, seeing how a film was made before the hayes office took over with film vetting,telling us what we should and should not watch. this film was made for dvd, it has copied quite well for it`s age and is watchable, it i amazing how film making has changed over the years, how did they set some of these scenes up. watchable if you are a film buff 
 If you see this movie heading your way, duck for cover.  Tape is a film of almost unimaginable cruelty.  Three very good actors, Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Robert Sean Leonard, (now seen on the excellent TV show, House), are trapped in a cheesy motel room for 83 minutes, more to the point, you are trapped in there with them.  This is the kind of film that aches for an obligatory car chase, frat house bikini contest, or helicopter crash.  It's easy to affix the blame.  Stephen Belber wrote the play and adapted it for film.  (Note to Mr. Belber:  Unless you're Samuel Beckett, do not attempt a three-person, one-room play, it's almost impossible to do well.)  This horrific gaff would seem to explain it, but there's more.  The film was directed by Richard Linklater, who gave us Waking Life, (also featuring Ethan Hawke).  For those of you who have not seen Waking Life, let us simply say that, though it features splendidly original animation, the film is arguably the largest swamp-gas-filled-dirigible ever to cross the horizon.    One can easily see why Mr. Linklater would be drawn to Mr. Belber's play, both Tape and Waking Life feature almost identical dialogue, it goes something like this:  Why are we here?  What?  You know.  You mean now?  Yes, well, I think so.  What?  Stop kidding yourself, you know exactly what I mean.  No I don't, honestly.  What?  Oh for God's sake, if you won't do it for me, do it for them.  I'm not following you.  But don't you see it?  There are options, certainly.  What?  Would you like a beer?  How many do you have left?  Several, well, some, not as many as I thought I had, but enough to let you have one, depending on how badly you want one, do you want one?  What?  A beer.  Is that why we're here, to talk about beer?  No, of course not, it's what you might call polite conversation.  Oh well that's just fine, our friendship has been reduced to the point of polite conversation, we no longer talk about real things, honest things?  Great, now Mr. Smarty Pants wants to talk about real things, honest things, this is a very intriguing if not astounding turn of events.  What?  Since when are you interested in what's real, aren't you the one who spent years building a castle of lies, a fortress to protect you from feeling anything?  I'm sorry, why am I here?  Isn't that a question for you to answer?  Perhaps, but you did, after all, invite me.  What?  For 83 minutes - and you never leave the room 
 A good book for casual crime readers who don't need heavy details, but amazingly inaccurate in several areas. Seems to repeat old myths told in other books rather than do research.   ie Joe the Boss's hit team did not include Anastasia, Adonis or even Siegel   or   Dutch Schultz was not shot in the bathroom or even shot by Charlie Workman. The caliber of the bullet found in Dutch matched those used by his men, not those who had shot his men down. The more accurate tale is that he was mistaken;y shot by his own men while trading fire with Lepke's boys. (The bathroom was directly behind the doorway where Workman had to be shooting from 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 a lot of self-indulgent syntho blips and squeaks instead of guitars, and the cover version of "interstellar overdrive" is just a straight remake of syd barrett pink floyd, only not as dynamic.  i've listened to it twice, just to be fair, but i'm irritated at myself that i spent money on this 
 I bought this book with high hopes having read the reviews here on Amazon but was sorely dissapointed with the book. Having read it cover to cover and nearly becoming comatose from doing so I have to say its not worth the money. The main reasons for saying this are: 1. It takes forever to get anywhere - I was half way through the book before anything diet and exercise related was brought up. 2. The first half of the book deals with getting in touch with your feelings. He talks a lot about learning to accept your body and miraculously you'll discover a way to lose weight. My arguement with that is if I hadn't accepted that I need to lose weight then why on earth would I be reading the book in the first place? 3. His style of writing felt condescending towards the reader, I felt like I was being told that I was a special little girl who just needed guidance in a big bad world. 4. The support network that he suggests signing up to on his website costs money from what I could tell by looking at the site. I don't know if I was reading the information on the site incorrectly - which now deals with his "new" diet anyway. 5. Having tried out the exercises in the book and followed the very basic diets plans (the kind of thing I learnt about basic food types, carbs, fats, proteins when in grade school) I've not felt any different or lost any weight. The exercises seems to be so low impact that I would have to do them constantly for several hours to work up any kind of sweat or improve my fitness/weight loss. 6. The title of the book is misleading. While yes, the exercises only take 8 minutes to do he forgets to mention the time for warming up/stretching and the writing and notes that you're supposed to make to get in touch with your inner whatever it is you're trying to reach. Overall I felt that this book was definately not worth the money. I'd rather pay for something that told me something useful within the first half of the book. However I would say that he does provide some interesting information on the metabolism. In fact I think I've burnt more calories and lost more weight by typing this review than I lost while following the book/plan for 5 weeks. In short, don't bother with this diet plan.  
 This is cute- but, it's not as good as Brown Bear. The words don't just roll off your tongue like Brown Bear. I don't find it as "catchy". 
 I am so glad I borrowed rather than bought What Came Before He Shot Her. I have been a fan of  George's writing till now, but after this tome I'll proceed with caution. If George had stuck to the story, which certainly had plenty of tension, rather than breaking it with her sociological asides, it would have been much better. I got really tired of her explaining in depth why Ness reacted the way she did, how Kendra felt, etc. Aren't writers constantly told "show, don't tell? 
 Ok, not only is this book a complete trainwreck, it's written by a gruf old betty that likes to pick on DEAD PEOPLE. Don't waste your time on this craptastic sack of meat socks. BURN THE WITCH 
 This book is basically Marxist view of art, and what art is intended to accomplish.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It does help you to examine your assumptions and beliefs a bit, and that's one of the things an education is supposed to do.  The book repeatedly hammers the idea that art serves the purposes of the ruling class.  This is beat upon to the point of tediousness.  There is also a chapter that can be summarized as "art serves the purposes of powerful men by trivializing women and encouraging them to think of themselves as an object d'art for the viewing pleasure of others.  Oddly enough, the book didn't really return to this them in the final essay when it talked about the visual image in advertising.  That's an arena where visual imagery is used to play on the insecurities of everyone, but especially women, to convince them that they are flawed and need __(fill in the name of a product)____ to be happy and respected and glamorous. Speaking of which, one of the more interesting points in the book (even though I believe it is flat wrong) is the discussion of the rise of "glamor" as a desirable trait.  I found the book interesting, and it irritated me, but only in a good way--By making me think about my views.  But it really is written from the perspectives of a trendy liberal from the early 1970s.  Instead of closing with a powerful message summarizing some important aspect of art that we have been taught, the authors even use the final paragraph of the last essay to point out that capitalism exploits the masses and coerces them to ignore their own best interest(that's literally what it says!).  Probably worth reading, but not a high priority.  The Penguin edition is compact and affordable, but the B&W images are so small that much of the value of the work is lost--You can't see details of the art being reproduced 
 DO NOT buy the case Canon sells for this camera. It takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in 
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh 
 Spend your money for some other DVD. If you're interested in watching this movie, just rent it 
 I would like to think of myself as someone who is fairly well informed of the (short) history and theory of video art. As such, I will say this book is a very basic, sort of bland overview of the langauge of video. It's very well put together in terms of it being flashy and "hip"; all the stills are well printed and all the big, "in-vogue" art star names are included (but where are people like Haron Faroqi? Or did he just shoot on film and thus not make the hipster cut?) With that said, there is little to no actual critical content in the writing. It introduces concepts in a very simple way, and doesn't actually end up saying much other than varying degrees of further artist canonization. I don't know maybe I am just too picky and also semi-brainwashed by more rigorous academic books on the topic, but I actually stopped reading the book because it was so boring. If you're looking for a slick coffee table book with which to impress your friends, one that will let them know that you too have joined that cool club called "connoisseurship of video art" and a book that they will tend to thumb through just to look at "all the pretty pictures" (which I find hilariously absurd- a book of still images taken from video), then this book is for you. If you're looking for anything deeper than that, I would look elsewhere to titles like "Illuminating Video : An Essential Guide to Video Art" by David Ross, Doug Hall, Sally Jo Fifer, and David Bolt. 
 Compare Raitt's "Soliquoy" on the Decca "Selections" CD to Hayden's on the London cast recording. Raitt's operatic majesty, masculinity laced with self-hatred, and charismatic musicality jump out of my tinny little CD player. Michael Hayden is - and I hate to criticize any performer - downright anemic by contrast, as well as lacking utterly the pathos and complexity of Raitt's showstopping version. The use of a real opera voice, with Raitt, was a stroke of genius, as it contrasts so deliciously and painfully with Billy Bigelow's shortcomings of character.  I cannot overstate this- DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS LONDON VERSION. Suffice it to say, it misses "the point" of the show.  I will continue to explore other versions, as my love of and fascination with this show is endless.  GET THE DECCA VERSION - "SELECTIONS FROM THE THEATRE GUILD MUSICAL PLAY,", instead. Whatever its deficiences (truncation mainly) its emotional and aesthetic rewards are enormous and triumphant 
 Hopefully THIS isnt the image the world has of the AMERICAN. If it is.....no wonder we are such a despised bunch.   First off....this book pretty much said nothing new. It is a "either you toe the line with US...or you are a traitor and giving comfort to the enemy" bunch of re-hash.Standard, neo-con, defense of each and everything that this administration does type thing.  The thing I found funny....I guess...is that he says WHY WE FIGHT? Is is just me....or do all the bloated, fat, wannabe heroes who write this stuff pretty much fit the DRAFT DODGER....sit in the back and start the fight and not get involved mold!!!???  Itis ALSO hard to read about how we should do all this from this virtuous air sack while he preaches to the masses and then does exactaly as he pleases at the gambling table. Oh....but then we are told by HIM AND HIS PACK OF TALK SHOW LEACHES that it was OKAY for Doctor Bennett to doit cause he could...ugh...AFFORD THE LOSS!!! YIKES!!  Moral clarity....better get some DOCTOR BENNETT before you start pointing your fat fingers at everyone else!!!  I guess this would be good reading to someone who wants their already neo-conistic views confirmed...the same reason to listen to his ridiculous radio show. But the hypocrisy of this arrogant, do-gooder was almost too muc 
 God, this book was awful! Not just the story, it was the construction that turned me off. The storyline is weak and the writing immature. Characters seem to sprout and wither with all the imagination of a photocopier. There is nary a connection between personalities and their responses to events. I can go on but I guess I need to be more concrete.  A sprite introduced within the first 45 pages suddenly develops ventriloquistic abilities for just one scene. Nary a mention before or later of that ability. While it is the prerogative of the author, a little more finesse would have been nice.  There is an unnecessary page or two of pontification before each of the five parts that comprise the book. For a work so shallow in its content, this essentially has a "insult-to-injury" aura.  Guenhwyvar is totally wasted/domesticated in the book. There was some evocation of majesty associated with the panther in the first book. In this third book, he had all the majesty of a tomcat. Also unbelievable is a battle towards the end where the panther is unable to dispose of the pet dog of the bad guy.  Then there's Montolio, what can I say....for a couple of chapters I thought this might be a promising character, especially with the blind archer bit. He even defeats the great Drizzt in battle, seemingly teaching him a "valuable" lesson. Then dies a few months later of old age. C'mon!!  With this book I give up on Robert Salvatore, never mind the ringing endorsement given to him by Margaret Weis in the 'Introduction' (strike one for her) 
 Honestly, these guys were funny two series ago.  They bring back some of the old characters (Emily Howard, Andy, the Fat fighters and Vicky Pollard) that wre funny then.  I just didn't feel it with the new characters.  And the old ones are getting tired.  More of the same I suppose.  Instead check out Extras, the new Ricky Gervais series, or the League of Gentlemen, for a dark treat.  
 When i first got this item i loved it I used it 4 times and it stopped working 
 Maybe my toenails are just too thick, but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them... I threw them away upon first use.  My old toenail cutters were the same design but I don't know who made them...they worked fine... heavier duty metal and much sharper.  These are junk IMHO 
 Walter Mosley, like too many mainstream and mystery writers, appears to believe that "science fiction" means "logic and plausibility get tossed out the window." That the official Amazon.com review compares this book to the work of Philip K. Dick is amazing and wrong-headed; Dick knew how to ground his surrealism in the real world and especially in real human beings. Whatever Mr. Mosley does in his mysteries and mainstream fiction, that's not what he's doing here 
 I read the Subjection of Women for my 17th Century Philosophy class.  I found it interesting, but hard to read.  Mill tends to be repetative and wordy.  He is very much the early feminist until you get to page 86 or 87 when he tells you that for all women can do, they should stay home and care for the family anyway.  I would suggest that others read this book, but give yourself time, because about 20 pages a night was all that I could muster.  At 100 pages it's not too long, but could have been said with more clarity and organization 
 Frank as well as the liberal elites, just don't get it.  That is why they are asking this question. Liberal elites are constantly mocking and discriminating against middle America.  I am proud to be from middle America.  There is no mystery as to why we vote Republican. We have not been tricked to vote Republican, we vote for candidates that have values, morals, love of our country and respect for each other; from life to death.  There is more to life than how much money you have, the car you have or house you own.  We are not impressed with wealth and power. These are the things that the elitist will never get.  Kansas is beautiful, the people are relaxed, educated and extremely friendly.  There is simply nothing wrong with Kansas.  Instead, it should be a model for both the east and west coasts.     
 I have a business background so someone thought I'd enjoy a "business" book as a Christmas gift. Bad idea! I've read plenty of books in this genre and this seems to cut and paste from all of them. I thought this guy was supposed to be some kind of business guru but, from what I managed to make myself read, he is struggling for new ideas.  And unless you're an rabid man-hater I'd stay away from Ch. 21 altogether, sexism disguised as progressive thought.  Lots of better books out there if you want to get some idea of upcoming economic trends, just browse any well-stocked business section at a local bookstore. As for this one I managed to convince the store clerk to let me exchange it for something a little more interesting 
 ZERO STARS ARE MORE APPROPRIATE AS G'N'R ARE REALLY AN AWFUL BAND.NOVEMBER RAIN AND DUST'N'BONES SUCK!!!!!.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS AWFUL ALBUM.CONSERVE YOUR MONEY AND GET STICKY FINGERS FROM THE ROLLING STONES INSTEAD. PS:G'N'R ARE TERRIBLE,G'N'R ARE TERRIBLE 
 I bought this hotbrush with the hopes that it would shorten the time it takes to dry my hair straight. Well it does do that but you are left with a frizzy mess if your hair is naturally curly.  The results are like using your hairdryer with a wide toothed comb and you still have to use your flat iron to smooth and straighten it out.  All in all this product is definately not worth the money.  Keep your blow dryer and round brush and save yourself $50 
 Worth getting for the Bowie cover (Rebel Rebel)but a Rollers Hits collection without Bye Bye Baby is pretty silly. The covers of I Only Want To Be With You and Be My Baby are somewhere between pointless and horrid 
 A poor, incomplete and unwieldy reference.  "Modern American Usage" fails to deal with many of the everyday issues people struggle with in their writing -- the list of omissions is long and varied -- and those that are included are sometimes addressed with a lack of thoroughness or clarity. Too often, and too irritatingly, entries merely redirect users to other headings, when the issue could easily have been resolved under the original entry-heading. Those involved in creating this edition seem not to appreciate that a little duplication goes a long way in making what is, first and foremost, a craftsperson's tool user-friendly.            
 The author had all the elements for a good mystery/suspense except for one thing, the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery.  I find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as Bag of Bones and The Stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner. Fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict. A body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body. We learn the man was from Colorado but very little else.  If the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened. I would recommend a Mary Higgins Clark mystery in place of this boo 
  The sound quality on this video is absolutely horrid! Is sounds like it was recored off of someone's tape recorder in mono.  The musical arrangements are very outdated but it was interesting in seeing Tina earlier in her career to see how amazingly she has developed as a singer, dancer and performer since then. There were definite signs of her future greatness as a performer. But unless you are a Tina Turner fan nut, best save your money and buy some of her later videos 
 Denzel Washington (The Manchurian Candidate, Man of Fire) plays a police chief in Banyan Key, Fl where he is sleeping with Sanaa Lathan (Brown Sugar) who is married to Dean Cain (Tv's Lois & Clark, Rat Race) and bascially Lathan finds out she's dying and she has some many months to live, which then she gives Washington part of the money if she dies. Soon after, Lathan goes missing, maybe dead and that's when the big kickaroo happens when someone frames him, so Washington goes around trying to correct things, trying not to be caught for something he didnt do. He also has a sexy cop partner, played by Eva Mendes. Some fun in this, including a hilarious John Billingsley (Tv's Angel, White Oleander, High Crimes) as Washington's beer drinking buddy and Washington saves this from being a complete disaster, there's also a nice sequence where Washington falls out a window onto a balcony as it comes apart and he has to climb back up. Mendes is hot but she doesnt show anything here and casting Lathan as the femme fatale was a big miscasting. Also starring Nora Dunn (Three Kings, The Hebrew Hammer). Sweet locations help to but the plot is weak 
 The idea of standing out from the clutter is re-presented in a jerky, repetitive format. Perhaps stemming from the author's non-native-to-English tongue. There are a few pearls here, though. Most of which, the concept of disruption levels. Otherwise, the books slips into brochureland once too often. I'm not sure if I'm reading a book on advertising or a collateral piece from Dru's agency 
 This book is a collection of repetitive excerpts written by reds about green politics.  It has little merit as a source of real data, and is very biased.  I had trouble believing that some portions were even based on truth, especially when a quote was preceeded by the phrase "As one expert said..." or some such thing.  What expert?  What was there name?  Finally, as anybody with a head on their shoulders can tell, few of the business strategies suggested in this book could ever really work.  The author frequently gives the example of Ben and Jerry's and Levi Strauss as corporations who have profited while implementing the afforementioned suggestions.  I ask, what about GM?  Walmart?  Boeing?  It is clear that it is only profitable to use this book as a business manual if one has a very narrow customer base 
 I will admit, I flipped through a few of the pages in this book, read some funny bits and decided to buy it. I might as well have thrown $15 down the toilet.  After suggestions that people with potential eating disorders should be "banned from the universe" and telling a pregnant women, with hormones raging, that if she isn't having sex with her husband that he'll probably have an affair, I gave up on this piece of trash. There are other comments too, that could make any woman not "Playboy" material (She is a Playmate, ladies) feel like garbage. If you want to make yourself feel horrible, go ahead and buy this book. If you'd like to celebrate your pregnancy and feel good about yourself, there are plenty of other books out there for you. STAY AWAY. 
 If you want to illustrate to the whole world just what a dullard and complete clutz you are then take heed of this book.  What on earth were the ghost writers thinking, were they trying to write in true "Bush House" style.  If they were they have suceeded beyond their wildest dreams making the dear man look as if he needs what poor old Ronnie needed in the end.  24 hour care.  Who is keeping who 
 I bought this book because I saw a review by Michael Quinion (www.worldwidewords.org). Although I enjoyed many of the essays in the book, the book was so poorly organized, I found myself very frustrated while reading it. Just a few editorial changes would have greatly improved it. It should have an index. The essays should be identified by the date they were published in the quarterly. Short intros to each essay providing some context and updating of the subject matter, as appropriate, would have made a big impact with a small amount of work on the part of the editor 
 I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good.  
 You would be forgiven if this book's subtitle - Profiles of Men of Faith Who Made a Difference - made you think of William Lloyd Garrison, Martin Luther King, Jr. or Mohandas Gandhi. But this book is only about the Roman Catholic men of the Knights of Columbus, or "KofC." Covering the period from the organization's founding in 1882 to the present day, the book profiles 60 men whom the author feels exemplifies the Knights' mission of charity and patriotic values. The reader might be surprised to learn that notables such as Babe Ruth, John Kennedy and Vince Lombardi were in the KofC.   Unfortunately, the short profiles are superficial and uneven. JFK and the Babe might have been Knights, but it's hard to see their membership reflected in their work. Side by side with martyrs and presidents are stories of quite modest men. The profiled men earned their place in the book by selling lots of KofC life insurance, having a military job of calling the families of soldiers wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq, or by dying in the World Trade Center collapse on 9/11. Each man, great and small, is shaped into a paragon of virtue and piety.  What made the book disappointing is that the backbone of the KofC is made up of humble and ordinary men who make relatively modest contributions to their communities. The book should have ignored the chancery, the Oval Office and the history books to focused on yard sales and Tootsie Roll drives. Telling the stories of these fallible flesh-and-blood men, as opposed to the plastic variety, would have been a better testament to the value of this organization 
 "The Case for Israel" is written by the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Politically, he could be described as a Cold War liberal. He supports gay rights, affirmative action and OJ Simpson, while opposing Cuba and Communism. And he supports Israel. Ironically, his support for Israel is as uncritical as the attitude of the CPUSA towards the Soviet Union. Dershowitz even defends house demolitions, and have proposed that entire Palestinian villages be destroyed in retaliation for suicide bombings. Despite protestations to the contrary, he also supports torture. Yet, Dershowitz is a member of Amnesty International!   "The Case for Israel" is a piece of badly edited and completely fanaticized pro-Israeli propaganda. It was obviously written in great haste, since it contains a number of factual errors and misspellings. For instance, the author seems to think that the Philippines are a Muslim nation, and calls the notorious Spartacist League "Spartacus League". In an earlier edition, he even claimed that the phrase "Turnspeak" comes from George Orwell. (Its Newspeak, of course.) While sloppy editing like this is amusing, the main theses of the book certainly are not. Here, I will concentrate on just two of them.   First, the question of collective punishment. Dershowitz argues that all, or most, Palestinians are guilty, since they sympathize with terrorist groups or actions. Thus, even punishment of civilians is justified. There is a "continuum of civilianity", says the author, since its not always easy to distinguish civilians from combatants among the Palestinians. They are all in on it, after all.   Of course, this bizzare line of argument works both ways. Most American Jews aid and abet Israel. Would that justify a bomb in a Brooklyn shopping mold? Most Israelis support the on-going attack on Lebanon. Does that justify bombing Haifa? And what about kibbutzniks at the Syrian border or settlers at the West Bank? They are heavily armed, and some of them are illegal, making the distinction between civilians and combatants on the Jewish side hard to draw. Indeed, Osama bin-Laden justified 9/11 in exactly the same way. The American people elected the politicians responsible for attacking Iraq and supporting Israel. Therefore, they must take collective responsibility for the death of Arab civilians. (See "Messages to the World" by Osama bin-Laden, available here at Amazon.com.)   Alan Dershowitz attempts to circumvent this by claiming that the Jews who are killed by Palestinian suicide bombings are "perfectly innocent" and are killed "regardless of their political views". But most Israelis dont vote for parties demanding immidiate withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, and today most support the attack on Lebanon. By Dershowitzian logic, they are therefore not "perfectly innocent". But the opposite is true as well: Dershowitz demagogically points out that some Israelis killed by suicide bombers were teenagers. Yet, he supports the massive ethnic cleansing of Germans by the Soviet Army during the last phase of World War Two, seeing this as suitable collective punishment. Of course, these actions affected teenagers as well, including teenage girls gang raped by Soviet soldiers... By implication, Dershowitz even seems to support the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where many teenagers and kids died as well! (For the record: I support the Allies and my grandfather was a Communist partisan during the war. But that doesnt mean I have to accept Allied atrocities.)   The author of "The Case for Israel" also claims that there is a difference between intentionally killing civilians (like Hamas) and unintentionally killing them while bombing military targets (like the IDF). He also points out that Israel gives advance warning before it bombs civilian areas. Are there no bounds to the cynicism of this man? Perhaps Israel doesnt "want" to kill civilians (its bad PR, after all) but their two invasions of Lebanon clearly prove that they couldnt care less if civilians do get killed. They are, after all, all guilty, right? As for giving advance warning, the IRA gave advance warning before its attacks against civilian targets in Britain. Logically, Dershowitz should claim that the IRA and the British were morally equivalent, but of course he doesnt. Besides, there may be many reasons why civilians cant leave a targeted area even if given advance warning. Witness the hurricane Katrina in the US. Besides, why SHOULD they leave? Would American Jews "just leave" New York if given advance warning about another al-Qaeda attack? I guess so, but they would surely demand swift counter-action by Ms. Rice. And Im not talking UN resolutions.   So why do Alan Dershowitz have one standard for the Jews and a quite different one for the Arabs? This bring me to my second point. The reason, of course, is that he believes Palestine to be rightfully Jewish. And not just Palestine, but apparently Transjordan as well!   On what grounds? That Jews have an automatic right to Palestine, no matter what, is an idea that can only be "justified" religiously. But the author is a secularist. With the risk of drawing some fire, I dont belive there are any secular grounds for automatically granting the Jews Palestine, save one: the "right" or might of conquest. Before the Zionist colonization, Palestine was predominantly Arab, and had been Arab for around 1200 years. No amount of sophistry can change this fact, and Dershowitz tries some! That Jews had an independent kingdom in Palestine over 2000 years ago is irrelevant. By that logic, New York City should be given over to the Manahata Indians. Ironically, that would force its Jewish community to re-settle in Israel, something they havent been very keen on doing for the past 60 years. Presumably, Egypt should be given over to some descendant of Cleopatra, provided such could be found.   The case for Transjordan being Jewish is non-existent on secular grounds, pace Dershowitz, and flimsy even on religious grounds. Some Biblical passages suggest that everything from the Stream of Egypt to the Euphrates is rightfully Jewish. That would include both Transjordan and half of Iraq! Other Biblical passages suggest that "only" the northwestern part of Transjordan should be Jewish. But most limit the Promised Land to Palestine proper, leaving out the areas east of Jordan. The rabbinical commentary "Tevuos Haaretz" exclude both the Negev and Transjordan from Eretz Israel, but include Lebanon. "Kaftor VaFerach" also include the coast of Syria, but again, no Transjordan. The relevant maps can be found in the Stone edition of the Jewish Bible, available from this site.   So what is the real case for Israel? Frankly, the only case that could be made for it, is that Israel exists, have a powerful army, and simply wont go away. In a perfect world, Palestine would either be Arab, with the Jews forming their own state some place else, or Jews and Arabs would love each other, and hence create a bi-national state. But the Jews created their own state in Palestine, and they dont like Arabs. Welcome to the dog-eat-dog imperfect world. For pragmatic reasons of Realpolitik, compromises are called for. What the compromise must be is obvious: a two-state solution, with Israel withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza strip, where a Palestinian state should be set up. The Palestinian refugees, unfortunately, cannot return, except perhaps to the Palestinian state. I agree with Prof. Alan Dershowitz on one point only: It was indeed a mistake for Arafat not to continue the negotiations at Camp David in 2000. However, I suspect that the road to Palestinian statehood would have been a rocky one even had he done so, since Israel would surely have demanded all kinds of "security guarantees" from such a state. Arafat isnt the only culprit here...   When I was more pro-Israeli, I wrote a more even-handed review of this book. Since then, I changed my mind. Mr. Dershowitz, I have read your book VERY CAREFULLY and only give it one star out of five!  
 The light output of this device is inadequate for reading at night.  It would have been better with three for four LEDs 
 CD album not what I thought it was....Of course PB plays a mouth harp.....of course, the songs sometimes all sound alike...that is why he's not a ZZ, BB or whatever. One maybe two songs on these 2 cd's I like.....the rest go in file 13. There's nothing wrong with this style of music but it falls far short of Buddy Guy, BB King, Albert King....I am/was relunctant to negative any musician and this is not the case....Many of his good songs are missing and "fillers" placed instead. Unless you are a whipping Paul Butterfield fan, keep looking..... 
 You really can't drink coffee from the mugs which come with this coffeemaker, unless the lids are off the mug... a definite design defect which defeats the purpose of a travel mug.  It is a very simple oversight: there is no "vent" hole in the mug's lid, so that coffee barely dribbles out of the sipping hole, even when the mug is full, and even if you tilt the mug as high as if you were drinking the last drops from the bottom of the mug.  It is a very frustrating experience.  Please also consider that the two cups may not fill up evenly as the coffee brews; one may slightly overflow while the other mug is not full.  Then there is the instruction book.  The English is fine, but does it really make sense to instruct the user to heat up the mugs first with hot water, and then to instruct the user to measure cold water into the same mug to fill the reservoir?  Of course, the user can figure his way around that, but the only way to use these mugs would be to drill an extra pinhole in each mug's lid for venting, or just use the mug around the house, without the lid.  The mug is comfortable to hold, but the thermal value is not too good, even when preheated with boiling water. I regret having made this purchase 
 Barbie can't sing,come on all the songs sound so bad with that voice,atleast put the real voice so it would sound better. 
 Knights, Castles, Medieval Life: Boring. I love Eyewitness books and I like a lot of the Water Eyewitness books, but Eyewitness books like Knights, Castles and Medieval Life just don't appeal to me. Eyewitness  Medieval Life gets 1 star because in about 1 or 2 places in the book it is  kind of intresting but other then that this book is very plain and boring 
 Mr. Wilson.... you should be ashamed of yourself. Based on the enjoyment I derived from reading all of the "Jack" series, I ordered this rip-off. Buyers Beware 
 Come on now its puffy daddy without a name change 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 This was definitely NOT my type of book.  I thought several times of just giving it up.  I can not, for the life of me,  figure out how this book could possibly be up for an award.  How hard is it to babble on paper?  That is exactly what this author did.  There were very few complete thoughts.  Sometimes I felt like the author had written this book after drinking 15 cups of coffee.  I find no talent in expressing yourself in a continuous stream of unorganized thoughts.  I think the book was about a dysfunctional family who is invaded by an odd character named Amber.  Why anyone would let a stranger stay with them for as long as they did is beyond me.  Maybe a sign of how dysfunctional they really were.  Amber does influence their lives in both good and bad ways.  It's just so hard to understand the story line and the conclusion with the way it was written 
 If this book can be published, then anyone can publish anything.  The point at which I realized that I should hurl this book across the room was on page 11 where the author claimed that fungi were species of plants. I'm sorry, Nicholas Bakalar, either your medical friends whom you acknowledged did not read your manuscript at all, or they are just as incredibly ignorant as yourself and are not good candidates for saving you from yourself.  I suppose this book could be hilarious for people who know better, but I worry about the 12 year old who picks it up and thinks he/she is being anything but misinformed by it. 
 Doesn't really change appearance of eye area. I'm 37 and am starting to get some lines,puffiness and circles, but used product 3weeks and wasn't impressed 
 It not transparent cover so its hard to figure out which CD it is. I had to put all stickers to recognize Cds faster 
 But it;s from the 70's.  It starts out pretty good with pai paio looking like a baddassss in a cool white suit.  And it actually gets very unwatchable from this pint on.  I actually stuck through this for about 45 minutes until I had to fastforward to the end, and it still did not live up to the begining, and the beginning really sucked, I just thought it had potential.  Pai paio actually looks pretty good, but NOTHING else was good in this.  It truly deserves that 1/5, and wouold have gotten the 0/5 if they had it.  Very sad movie.  I paid 5 dollars and 99 cents at the local cd used place and this is seriously worth around, can't think of a price, so I would say if you payed nothing for it you will get ripped off.  So do not buy, movie starts out ok, but jimmy wang yu's screaming tiger is better.  I thought that was bad, and jason is so much better than jimmy, it is just truly horrible to watch this movie.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
 When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 I read this book and was appalled at the slanted agenda it had. Are omissions lies? If so, this book is a huge lie and here is why; I served in F Company, 51st LRP (Airborne) Infantry and I am the author of the book 'I SERVED.' We were the military field Intel performing recon and ambush in six and 12-man teams that watching the enemy's movements throughout the Saigon II Field Forces AO (area of operation) to the Cambodian border. We were the eyes and ears for IIFFV directly under General Fred Weyand who started up this 200-man strong shock, Ranger type, LRP unit in September 1967.   On Jan. 3, 1968, one of our recon teams captured a high-ranking VC officer who was carrying a map of the upcoming Tet 1968 Offensive that matches other military Intel that was coming in. Gen. Frederick Weyand laid out some great plans to hammer the enemy, but you'd have to read my book to get those facts.  The objective of the Army was not to run around a blab everything to news reporters that there was a huge attack coming! We were there to stave off the enemy's aggression in South Vietnam. LBJ had led General Westmoreland to believe that he could jump off from Khe Sanh once the North Vietnamese broke the cease-fire during Tet 1968 and cut off the Ho Chin Minh trail in Loas. President LBJ not only lied to the military he lied to the American people in his failure to set the records straight about Tet 1968, but he was bored and burnt out by this time! Walter Cronkite came out with his statements of what our government should do in Vietnam. You can see the same happening with today's reporters talking about the military with the War on Islam. How many of these reporters served in the military? NONE, but my goodness they know everything don't they?!  The South Vietnamese soldiers were allowed leave during Tet in order that they would defend their own hamlets, towns and cities with Hue being the only failure.  If you ever want a real military failure on your hands tell a news reporter or some 200 US Army colonels gathered for a party in Saigon that this author seem to take as a total and compete failure of Tet 1968 because none of these colonels knew what was coming!   The final straw that broke the credibly of this author's book is his not mentioning what harm Saint Walter Cronkite did during Tet 1968. Cronkite was sent to visit Gen. Weyand after his visit to Hue and told General Weyand that he had a good story of how the enemy were slaughtered in open fields starting at 0106 hours, long before the first rockets fell at 0300 hours in Saigon region, but he was going with the story of the thousands of bodies that he saw in and around Hue. Those bodies were those of Vietnamese reporters, school teachers, lawyers, doctors and anyone who wore eyeglasses and, of course, the hit list that the Commies had.  Don't waste your money of this book. It is very slanted and I bet the author was a journalist at one time or another with this book making out that the Military is "BAD!" News reports are "GOOD" and other such BS. 
 I've enjoyed Michael Thomas Ford's writing in the past, but this story is poorly written, poorly edited and extremely shallow.  I couldn't help but think that Ford was just cranking out a story to meet a deadline.  There's no depth of character in any of the main figures.  The story line seems to serve no purpose other than to connect the over abundant and graphic sex scenes, some of which are extremely brutal.  If your looking for a good story with believable characters...keep looking for it 
 Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I had to read this book for class.  It wasn't that good.  Conversations get confusing because its not clear who is saying what.  It might be a small book but its tedious reading.  I'm usually a fast reader but it took me a couple of days just to get through 3 chapters.  I asked around at class and found that I was not the only one who had this problem.  Its less painful if you just get a summary or if you just get someone to tell you what happens 
 The timing info in this book is useful, if you live in Michigan's average area.  Skip it if you live in Northern Michigan.  Very little of the timing will apply to you.  One other thing I didn't like was how many chemicals (of various sorts) they tell you to dump on your lawn.  Every month it seems like they're telling you it's time to put one or two more on your lawn or in your beds.  This type of gardening is not for me, and it scares me to think that people just strating with gardening might read this and think that they are all necessary. 
 I can't remember ever reading a  book that I enjoyed less. The Easy person is so forced that no one would or could believe him. I,ve read other books by Mosley, but this, Easy Rawlins should just go away. 
 The reason I bought this film, is because I like Talia Shire. The only reason to buy this film is because of Shire, cause if you don't like Shire then I wouldn't recommend you buying this film.   The Landlady follows the frustrated Melanie, a woman who's husband cheats on her, a situation that lets something snip in her mind. She becomes obsessed with having the perfect family and husband. After she kills her husband, she moves into an appartmentbuilding which she inherrited. There she meets Patrick who becomes her new object of desire to start a new family with. And she lets nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody come in her way...  In technical aspects, the Landlady is ok, not fantastic, but ok. It has good camera movements (some could have been way better to make it more tense) and the lighting is well done which gives some scenes a nice horror feel. The music also is nice in some scenes.   Now the acting could have been way better, not counting Talia Shire. Shire is the one who keeps the film away from the pit of the terribly bad films. But although she acts good, in some scenes you really feel that she doesn't give her 100% which is a pitty: she could have done way better than this. But one thing she does perfectly: even though she is the bad one in the film and kills a lot of people, she actually makes you feel for the pshyco landlady. That is what makes her performance ok. Now the rest of the cast acts so emotionalless that you absolutely don't care that they are getting killed. The only one I did care for was a character played by Dee Freeman, she does an ok actingjob also. But as for the rest: they don't feel like people but just minor props that have to be taken care of. You will find yourself looking at the screen saying: "Oh, there goes another one."  Conclusion: The murders look more funny than they look scary or emotional. Also the tempo of the film is sometimes awfully slow. It takes a long time from one murder to another which will dissapoint slasher and horror fans.   So when you sit down and watch the Landlady, watch it with your sense of humor switched on, then it will be more watchable then when you watch it counting on a scary horrorfilm.  So if you are a Talia Shire fan, I would recommend you this film cause it is fun to see Shire do something totally different than playing a lovely sweet innocent woman. If you are not a Shire fan, then this film will look like just another low budget, wanna-be horror film to you.        
 Sadly Revernd Sundby is just one of many people riding the tide of the "feel good" God.  As much as she may think she values truth, she has followed interpretations of scripture to land at what she wants to believe, not what is truth.  There are lots of online resources surrounding this issue which are much more compelling than this.  Don't get me wrong, I agree with her that God loves gay people and that the church should not judge them simply because of their orientation.  But the message of the Bible is crystal clear - God created sex to be between a man and a woman within marriage to the exclusion of all others.  That's not how all Bible characters behaved, but whenever word comes straight from God or Jesus, that's how it's portrayed.  Homosexual practice is not a sin worse than any other, but it is a sin.  And like any other sin it requires the grace of God for one prone to that given sin to turn away from it and be made a new creation in Christ.  All that such literature as this book serves to do is give false feel-good answers that seem to take away the problem, but don't bring people any closer to the truth 
 I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person. The writing was awkward and heavy-handed... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here. It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery/romance. The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs, the beautiful rendering of the landscape, the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing.  All I can say is, the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye... he has given us much enjoyment.... he deserves better.  And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman's plot lines.. the public should be warned 
 Sorry, but this geek is not jumping on the geekwagon.  Despite being sub'ed Adventures in Adolescence, many of the anecdotes actually deal with the author's pre-adolescent years, coming of age-olescence if you will, and frankly they are the funnier entries.  (But am I wrong to doubt that the author could really start having orgasmic experiences at age 7?) The biggest problem is that the germ obsession sets the author apart from the typical geek, who would have gladly braved a little [spoiler warning here] puke breath to make out with a cute girl, and way too many of the experiences described in the book deal with that phobia.  There are 2-3 laugh out loud passages, 6-8 cleverly turned phrases, but they don't make up for the laborious redundancies - Bill, we get it about the rope, enough with the "25 foot lover" references, the repeated return to the mincing descriptions, etc.  
 Don't know about anyone else, but the DVD I purchased had lousy video.  The only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots. All of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either. I know the concert was indoors, but I've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem.  Did I get a bad DVD or did anyone else have this problem 
 "Everything is an echo," Ilan Stavans wrote in the essay Lost in Translation. "To live is to plagiarize, to imitate, to steal." And so he does. The editorial gimmick of putting together anthologies of well-known authors under the common title 'the essential...' is usually reserved to creative writers of fiction and poetry, whose work can be somehow distilled, but Ilan Stavans is an author who has made his reputation primarily by writing about others and the editorial gimmick feels exactly like one because there is no 'essential' Stavans, only the 'echo.' I always found it disturbing to realize how ruthless and brutal Stavans has been against Latina writers, such as Ana Castillo and Sandra Cisneros (see 'Form over Content', p. 41). Stavans has been particularly dismissive of the styles conjured by Chicana writers to create their own respective worlds. The reason for such pathological fear of the language of women may be discerned in this book. Stavans' heroes are usually male writers who loom large above him--Octavio Paz, Walter Benjamin, Elias Canetti, Lionel Trilling--writers Stavans has invoked to 'explore' his own identity as a Latino-Jewish male. By his own admission, Stavans exists in the hyphen of his identity, rather than in the assertion of a self-created identity. This is why he writes so brutally against Chicana writers: because they have destroyed the paradise of hypenations, they have asserted their own identities through the difficult task of creating and molding new identities and a new language to go with it. The short stories in this book, particularly, show Stavans at his most derivative, imitating Kafka while alluding to him 
 I've you're a fan of the tough, gritty action books of Eric Van Lustbader, you'll be demanding your money back if you take the time to read Rain Fall.  Not only was this a bad book, it was the wimpiest "hit man" novel I can possibly imagine.  One review on the book cover boasted "plenty of sex and martial arts action" so I thought, ah, a new Van Lustbader-type book set in Japan, but boy was I wrong.  This book contains little more than long, pointless conversations and bland, generic descriptions of Tokyo which are so dull they could have been lifted from a Frommers guide book.  The martial arts action in the book is virtually nonexistent; the first fight scene doesn't occur until roughly 150 pages into the book.  The same with the supposed sex scenes; there are two, both of which are rated PG at best and basically amount to the narrator saying "then we made love."  Steamy?  Sure...to a mormon, maybe.  As if all of this wasn't bad enough, the prose itself was stilted and unnatural, as if the author sat with a thesaurus in his lap while he wrote the book, trying to drop in as many odd-sounding synonyms as possible.  As for the characters, they're all overused stereotypes from the nerdy computer whiz sidekick to the sometimes good, sometimes bad cop friend.  The "hero," however, is the worst of them all.  Supposed tough-as-nails hit man and martial arts expert John Rain gets the snot kicked out of him on a regular basis, turns gawky and embarrased around attractive females, and seems to only be able to kill out of shape, middle-aged men who can't fight back.  I'll close by saying that I know this review sounds horribly negative, but I've worked in the book industry for most of my life and I can't for the life of me see how this book ever got published 
 It's always easy to criticize somebody's personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars, but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable ACTRESSES and not STARS of the studio era. So it comes pretty natural to ask : Is Esther Williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook Margaret Sullavan? Was Grace Kelly's talent so overwhelming to forget that Miriam Hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as Lubitsch, Wyler, Mamoulian, Hawks and Vidor to stunning results? What was wrong with Mary Astor's acting  and what is right with Kim Novak's ?   Actress to me means Patricia Neal or Shelley Winters - Norma Shearer or Natalie Wood were stars....think about it 
 Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner.  He goes thru the motions of "doing his job" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.  I find Jose Saramago's "Blindess" to be a far superior book to The Plague.  Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving.  The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.  I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over.  I would pass on this book 
 This book is not what it purports to be.  It is a thorough catalog for commercially available phonics based reading education programs.  There is not actually any advice on "parenting".  There is plenty of advice on how to be adversarial with your child's teachers and school.  There is extensive use of the term "research-based", and this is what the authors use to support their arguments.  However, their scope is extremely limited.  The research they cite focuses on what works to teach kids to read words (decode the symbols) early in the school years, rather than what works to help kids truly read and comprehend complex language.  There is no discussion of reading comprehension.  I have no question that with their recommended approach, we could all have 6 year olds reading Dick and Jane.  They don't address the ultimate goal of reading,  understanding what one reads 
 On a +ve note the book presents one view of the SOX Act that all senior persons involved in Corporate Governance should be aware of. IT Professional must be aware of this act, as it does impose stringent information requirements and controls on your systems deployed in the production environment. Recommend that you look at exhibit 11.1 (P108)/ exhibit 11.2 (P111) quite useful.   On a -ve note - After the first 100 pages (some what padded out) It was my opinion that Information Technology Professionals will not gain any true value from reading this book. However, as I continued I did find some useful snippets of useful information- However not enough for me to gain true value.   There are some good quotes in the book, but lacks the essence of the Systems view to which it aims targets in its title - certain parts of the book confused me e.g. Exhibit 1.1 (P27). In the monitoring section P56 - The author missed the opportunity to discuss the monitoring of internal systems messages within the enterprise. Exhibit 2.1 (P44) is repeated as Exhibit 6.1 (P76) with no real value added On P77 the Author states that XML, middleware , Java will be a success factor - This as a general statement is wrong.  But hey thats my opinion ... 
 ok i've listened to this album quite a few times and still have yet to find a strong point. i didn't get his first album so i'm not comparing like some reviewers may. "on again tonight" is the reason i   bought this album and it's one of the only songs i like on it. some people who really like this cd will say "don't listen to him". or something like that but i'm right. a few of these songs aren't very well written and just trail off. as far as his voice goes, even if he has range, his voice isn't very good. i mean i like his voice on "beer man" and "on again to night" but some of these songs his voice makes sound worse. although some songs are ok none are exactly good. if you don't have the new toby keith, little big town, gary allan, jason aldean, jamey johnson, or brad paisley album(to name a few) get one of those cause ALL of them are much better than this.  don't waste your money on it...i di 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 Don't buy this.  It doesn't work.  The ink is not even at all if and when you can get it on the stamp.  I've attempted around 50 stamps (on some range balls) and not one is crisp and clear.  The stamp is either running (too much ink), or the middle letter is messed up from too little ink.  Save your money, buy a sharpie pen and mark your balls with that 
 Aniston is just about OK, but manages to leave an impression of sorts! However the downside was that she kind of brought the "Friends" method of acting in this movie too! Also the movie does not really explain some of Aniston's actions such as why she told the store manager about Jake's whereabouts ! Sort of a half-finished movie! Not a well polished product! 
 Read Quigleys Tragedy and Hope.  Its a much more important book(especially the 2nd 600 pgs) and a better read too.  After reading it you will feel as though you were just pulled out of the Matrix.. 
 I visited Ireland from the U.S. and my hair dryer sparked when I used the adapter and fried both of them. Also I had a convertor for my iPod, but was unable then to use the adapter. The USB charger never worked. Oh well, live and learn. 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 Not sure about these other reviews but all I can say is make sure to buy yourself a package of Tylenol's with this book, because after reading a few pages your head will be ready to explode.  I am trying to read this book with other 25 people and not one person has said that this book is good.  Make sure that you have alot of spare time if you are going to read this crap, because you will be taking more naps while trying to get through this book, then all the naps you have taken throughout your whole lifetime.

 Although Anne made some excellent points, it was still one-sided. She still speaks of Republicans in general as being better which is wrong because many of them are just as hypocritical as Democrats (and some are worse because they know what God commands but don't actually care), and although she gives some explanations as to why Republicans are the better party, they are deceptive and wrong.  For example that Republicans are better because they promote Chrisitianity and are specific in their arguments: yes, that is true in some ways, however many promote false Christianity and make it look bad because many of them are not truly Christians but putting up a show. That needs to be said otherwise people get the impression often that all Christians are hypocrites and that it's all about financial gain or vain glory. And merely having a specific argument doesn't make an argument better. For example I can say, "Democrats are out to get your kids and the poor because they want to raise taxes on the poor and give tax cuts to the rich and want to force children to learn white wash" but so called Republicans like George Bush want to do that too and have done that.  I would like to say that this is a good book to give to a young girl, because it shows you can still be fememine, wise, and a Christian, and yet not be a fool or knowledgeable and emotionally immature (in other words a nerd), but it has too many big errors.  It's helpful howewver for everyone in general who wants to know what is wrong with some type of arguing and how to argue constructively. Although she doesn't give a thorough explanation on that subject, it's very good and concise. And I just happened to be comforted by her words because the day before had been attacked with vagueries by a pastor from an AOG church 
 This book started out good with clear writing and a scary killer, but, it came to a too easy to figure out conclusion.  And, at 386 pages, it is way too long for a mystery!  It should have ended sooner.  After a certain point it dragged on.  The author is a reporter and I thought that maybe he gets paid by the word!  The female lead was somewhat unbelievable with her romantic abandon, considering her position in the community and in that era.  If I come across the second book, I hope that it is a shorter, more suspenseful read.

 I was hoping to identify at least a few of the 11 different mushrooms in my garden.  Unfortunately not a single one is shown in the picture plates.  I am now in search of a better book 
 This book isn't worthless, but it's not very good either.  Cabot encourages women to be positive, specific and proactive in their approach to men, which I appreciate.  She devotes a good portion of the book to the "love languages"--auditory, visual, and feeling.  This information, so long as it's not pushed to the extreme or used by a manipulator, is interesting and could help people in any sort of relationship.  However, ultimately, this is still a "man-hunting" book, with all that that phrase implies.  I think that Cabot's approach requires a bit of tunnel vision, a bit of obsession about men, and a lot of manipulation.  Take what you can from it, but I think that Sherry Argov's Why Men Love [...]is a better investment

  I am heading to Israel around December and am looking for a book to sharpen my knowledge beforehand.  I encountered this book on a bookshelf in my community clubhouse.  I have attempted to read it on my commutes to and from work.  The result: I either fall asleep within minutes or forget everything I just read.  It's that bad.  It's not that it's poorly written.  It's just that Roth tries to do so much in so little space.  The way he introduces characters is confusing and hard to follow.  I will try to pummel through this book.  But I already purchased A History of Israel by Howard Sachar.  So hopefully that one's a little better.  Good luck. -AY 
 Whoa! I was expecting a well-written study of the lives and perspectives of young geniuses and high-IQ adults from this New York Times journalist.  Instead, "Hothouse Kids" insults and distorts the subject and subjects of  study.   The author skewers everyone she meets: parents,"gifted" study educators  and researchers, educational product developers and competitive events  organizers, even the bright children--whom she pities for what she sees as their  their "nerdish freakiness".   A former smart girl herself, the author can't seem to find anyone likeable  in the subculture she has chosen to explore. She pokes fun at how these  people look, the clothes they wear, the cars they drive. One mother of a  brilliant child, for example, has hair "suitable for a Journey music  video." Another walks with a "jerky gait which combines a limp and a  strut". One man has "wiry clown hair", another communicates through  "swaggering body language". A gifted child's build reminds the author of  "Matt Damon on a stretching rack" (whatever that means).  Somebody has a "lazy eye", someone else rolls her eyes (which is, apparently, too "Gen X"), and a respected leader in the field of gifted education is accused of  dressing like "a mystic". One family's kitchen, where the author was  welcomed, confided in, and provided with food and drink, is criticized as "rickety--even eccentric". The meal, too, is weird, not up to the author's standards. Apparently, she finds everyone in the "hothouse" she is studying to be strange and distasteful.  Several interview subjects for this offensive book have complained of being  misquoted (see other reviews). This is not surprising as the included  quotes typically consist of odd jumbles of disconnected ideas and thoughts --as if the author had extracted sentences from lengthy interviews and strung them together out of context.   As the author of more than two dozen nonfiction books, I was shocked and  disheartened by "Hothouse Kids". It is difficult enough for writers to  persuade people to agree to interviews without such a glaring reminder of  the potential for journalistic abuse of power. The process of interviewing  requires trust: that the writer will not use the interviewees' words  against them. If I want to write a book on the subject of high-IQ children,  who in the field would gladly agree to an interview now?  Perhaps the author feels that she has exorcised some of her own disturbed memories of childhood. Unfortunately, she has added little to the study of gifted kids while hurting a number of people in the process of vindicating her own bitterness 
 My dog had two of these.  ONe I got when she was much younger and loved it but lost it.  Now she is almost a year old and bought her another one. She tore the whole thing apart in an hour.  Not a good toy for big dogs dont wast the money on a big dog that will eat it in a short amount of time 
 I usually only write positive reviews for movies that I like. Normally I feel it is a waste of my time to write something negative but this time I would like to save anyone thinking of buying this a little money. If you MUST own all the Masters of Horror then buy this otherwise don't waste your time, it is an hour of your life that you will never get back. I am hard put to understand why the other MOH directors would even consider this poor offering from Mick Garris in the same league as the other stories if for no other reason that this "story" makes all the others seem that much better. It is poorly written (by Mr. Garris) and is overall incredibly empty. The only thing anyone watching this can be left to wonder at the end of the "movie" is WHY? Maybe the true horror here is in the idea that people will actually sit through an entire viewing of this garbage...now that is frightning!! This can't even be catagorized as so bad it's good. What a shame because there are other neglected directors out there that could have put forth a much better effort. The taste left in my mouth after viewing this was not that of chocolate...  
 In each pack there have been several dvd's that aren't any good.  Too many bad discs in my opinio 
 Peter Clement might be considered a wonderful novelist when it comes to medical thrillers, but I found his work to be full of cliches.  He also switches point of view between first and third person which I found to be very jarring, completely taking me out of the story.  He tries the red herring approach, but that doesn't work either because the threads he weaves aren't all that believable to me.  It's true he has the medical background, but he characterization felt stiff.  His characters were flat, plus he told more than showed the action...or he did both.    I don't want to be told he's angry, I want to be shown.  Also, his attempts at showing romance, I felt, were clumsy.  I've read several books by Michael Palmer, Robin Cook, and a few other authors, and when I placed one of Palmers and Clements side by side, I couldn't help but notice that I felt as if I was peering over Palmer's characters' shoulders whereas with Clement felt the need to explain absolutely everything.  Very annoying.  One last thing, he needs to keep his exclamation points in check 
 F.X Toole exemplifies a point that I often attempt to share with friends that are sports fans..... boxing literature is of the only sport that continually thrusts characters raw, frightening yet lovable at us at every level.  Baseball lore and lyric is always an interesting personal deversion, particulairly on a cold winter's night.  But I follow and enjoy Baseball as a sport.  Boxing, as seen on TV on the other hand, is an undertaking which has taken a barbaric back- seat....too ruthless, savage and lacking star power.  However, when written about well and with an insiders' viewpoint, Boxing jumps off the page and into my heart.  Ponud For Pound carries a great deal of pathos, and some really cool jargon....makes me feel like I had a stogie and a fedora and a rolled up program in my hand.  Enjoy this book...I did 
 I purchased this humidifier, and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week. One night, it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again. I called the company, who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out, and they would be sending a new one to replace it (with no cost for shipping to me). I received the new one a week later, which to my disappointment, did not have the nightlight feature. I also noticed it was from a different brand company. I can't remember the name but it also began with the word "sun." So far, the new humidifier is working fine (about 2 weeks now), but it has a lower water capacity so I have to refill it every night (vs. every 2 nights with the original one) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment. The process of replacing, however, was very smooth and also free so I'll give them 2 stars for that

 ``People  say again and again that philosophy  doesn't really progress, that we  arestill occupied  with the same philosophical problems as were  theGreeks.But  the people who say this don't understand why ishas to be  so. It is becauseour language has remained the same and  keeps seducing us  into asking the same questions.  As longas there continues to be a verb  'to be' that  looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and  'to  drink', as long as we stillhavethe adjectives  'identical', 'true',  'false', 'possible',as  long as we continueto talk of a river of time, of  an expanseof  space, etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no explanation seems capable of clearing up.And what'smore,this  satisfies  a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar  as peoplethinkthey can  see `the limits of human  understanding', theybelieve of course thatthey  can see  beyond these.``   ''Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language``  ``Ambition is the death of  thought'''  These three quotes are from Ludwig Wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out).Dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some40 years, is one them. It is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, John Searle, studied under famous Wittgensteinians (Searle with John Austin, Dennett with Gilbert Ryle) but Searle got the point and Dennett did not. Dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to Ryle, whose famous book 'The Concept of Mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  That book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  Dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes Wittgenstein, Ryle(andmany others since) have exposed in detail.   Byaccident,just before this book, I had  read ''The Minds I'', which Dennett coauthored withDouglas Hofstadter in 1981. They made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess---Nagel's `What is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of John  Searle's Chinese Room argument explaining why computers  don't think.   Nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  Searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does(eg,it can translate Chinese  without understanding it). Likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what countsas good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. Our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave,cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and anydiscussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. Wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. Unfortunately, he died inhis prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  worksand he never wroteany popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few.   Searle  is one of the world's leadingphilosophers and has written  manyextremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in Dennett'swork.His review ``Consciousness Explained  Away'' of Dennetts 1991 book`'Consciousness Explained'' and his book''The Mystery of Consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither Dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic)havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.Many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things, but it isclear that we are  nowhere near it now. Dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  Searle with vituperative personal attacks.Searle has been accused by Dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and Searle has made it very clear for 30 years that WE are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  He just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   Searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology'',the views ofDennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. Dennett repeats his  mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how! Unsurprisingly, there isnot one reference toWittgenstein or Searle in theentire book.There arehowever, many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is.   Like most people, it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo  certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite  unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the  world. They are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.Wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with.  Dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(whichI hopewe can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). He wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. However, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. Naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``Consciousness  Explained``.   It is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. Please recall the last sentence of Wittgenstein  from the opening quote: ''And what'smore,this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent, because, insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of  human understanding',theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond  these.`` The  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. If one is very, very  careful,some understanding is possible, but Dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand.   There are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and Dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. There is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  He knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. By extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). However, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. The  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. This  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes.   He correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  This obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  If so, they will definitely win at least one Nobel Prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). So, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). And while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  It is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  But infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer.   He starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, Schrodinger's  dead/alivecat etc) and as Feynmann said many times ``Nobody understandsphysics!'' Many think nobody ever will.   On pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` This is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.  On page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? Nobody but philosophers. We make choices. What's the problem?  One has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  What are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? I doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. This shows that there is something  strange about such questions. Wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. There are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. Decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'John will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  John might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. Some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, notbeing able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have.   One can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. Normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. This was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. It is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degeneratinggenetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  Hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' Let us alter Wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''As longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink',as long as we continueto talk of  freedom of action, of saying I  wish I had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up.''  As withmost philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. On page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? Even if I  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, I  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. Only then  can I go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if I had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  Wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  The ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. So I would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose.    On the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  He says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'It appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' And on page 13--''It is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. The whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do NOT learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. There is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does.   On pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  Do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? The language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. We can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). The  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine havingchoices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. But Dennett is  saying thisis the universal case. If making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. If we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away.  .  On page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. There is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. Discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. Of course there is no mention  here of Wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of Searle's now classic works  on Intention and Social Reality.   He spends much time on  Ainslie's book 'Breakdown of Will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes. Hemakes much of the excellent work of Robert Frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. It was Bingham's idea, amplified by Frank and by Boyd and Richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. He suggests these as examples of Darwinian approaches  that areobligatory and promising. Indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. All that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. He does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice.   Onpg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. But where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! Dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  Again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. As he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the Prisoner's Dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. When the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious,they are much slower and  less reliable. So, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.  Dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. The evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. Our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  If we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.Our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever Dennett thinks can do it.   We can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. These intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. In the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. This is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world.  On pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making(from certain angles)''. He claims that thisplays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  The smoke is thick but I  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. He insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise.   He  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and I doubt he could  do so. Normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, I expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position.   At this point he also starts his discussion of Libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that I felt was worth my time.   On page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  And ``Illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` He says  the trick we need is to see that  ``I`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``Mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''The process of self description... is  what we  are''. The crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  He realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''I know that many  people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. It seems to them  to be a trickwith mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness, and the real Self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' Many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but I would  say it's incoherent and  thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long beforewegot this far.    On pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  This is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'Darwin's Dangerous Idea''!  Presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  He says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'Consciousness Explained to find that there is no answer there either).  Though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. If he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.    We are also told here that R&D(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  I am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  It seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  He continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be OK if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  And then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.   On pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. There is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  I would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead Dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.    He also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. This again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  I know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  We may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). I suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  Another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.    On pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. And on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. Again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. We are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  It is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.    On pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  It's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. On pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  He also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'The Blank Slate').   He often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  This happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   On pg 262 he tries to explain how an ESS(Evolutionarily Stable Strategy) can produce morality. His idea here is that genetic `R&D` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  I would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  Culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.    The last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. He refers to the legal classic by Hart  and  Honore, which I started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by Wittgenstein.  Dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  But, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. There is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. It is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. I find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of Osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. One rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. There is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that Dennett is morally superior. After 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  It seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines.   So, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? It seems  clear(eg, see Pinker's `The Blank Slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. On  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. The moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. But our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect.   How remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  And if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fMRI  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  But a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  And then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  To return to the quote at the beginning--'Ambition is the death of thought'.  Indeed--though clearly Wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts 
 Having bought this knife over a year ago I must say I have had much better for less. I have since purchased a carbon steel Japanese Sashimi knife with a wood handle that is equal to the Global save it's blade requires a quick wash and dry to avoid staining. I find the Global's stainless steel blade to require less maintenance, however, due to its brittle temper the tip broke soon after I purchased it. My main critisism is that the continous metal grip is slick and with wet hands (as one might have when slicing a large fish) there is the distinct possiblity of losing your grip and your hand sliding forward toward the blade. In addition, the rear cutting edge of the blade adjacent the grip has a sharp edge exposed and given the slippery handle it is not as safe as other designs.  I wouldn't mind the high price as long as you get equal value. In this case there are better traditional Japanese alternatives easily found on the web. I suspect I helped pay for celebrity chef endorsements. I would not reccomend it to anyone unless a contemporary appearance is  more important than functionality; It is a good looking knife-even with a broken tip!   
 This is one of my 4 year old daughters picks for reading time right now and I cringe every time she hands it to me.  Okay fine that the kid paints his face so scary that anyone who sees it doesn't just scream, they pass out.  We're obviously breaking from reality here, and that's just great.  I can accept a few things as literary embellishment such as at Halloween each adult has massive amounts of candy for the trick-or-treaters, and a pillowcase can swell to hold a dumptruck sized load of candy.  I realize the fun of the book is in the exaggeration.  But it starts to get into things I don't want to have to explain.  Most innocently, that the kid eats candy for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snacks for a year.  But less innocently that saying the magic word, "Trick or treat," gives anyone and everyone who can incapacitate you in some way like scaring you silly can then march into your house and stroll off with whatever they like, from the halloween candy on your table to the contents of your fridge.  And then, when the policeman hears what the kid has been doing, flat out telling him "I go in and take all the candy" the policeman's response isn't any sort of a reprimand, it's "bet you can't scare me."  All of this is perfectly acceptable.  Certainly didn't bother the cop.  It does bother me and every time we read this book we have to take a moment and discuss how it is bad to go into other people's houses and take their stuff under any circumstances.  However, ironically, the book does inform us that teenagers are too old to go out trick or treating.  Kids practicing larceny?  That's OK!  But when those teenagers go out trick-or-treating?  Well, that's frowned on.   Oh by the way when a little kid steals the candy from an overage trick-or-treating (larcenous) teenager, that's okay too.    
 I saw this movie in the theater and was amazed at how quiet it was in there! Since I was bored, I found myself looking at other people there to see if I could get a read on what they were thinking, and after it was over I asked my friend what he thought. He said, "Oh, it was okay" but didn't elaborate. So let me: it was painfully unfunny, with jokes or punchlines that fell flat, horrible acting, totally predictable, and very forgetable. This is a movie you might want to rent ONLY if you're really bored and nearly every other movie is out. And even then, you'd be better off to go home empty handed. There's not even much eye candy to recommend, which is a nice fallback if there's nothing else going for it. How people could give this movie anything more than 1 star is puzzling. Just because you like a movie shouldn't mean you give it 5 stars, especially when it's as bad as this one. I mean, I liked Freddy VS Jason, but there's no way I'd give that movie 4 or 5 stars. This is bottom of the barrel 
 The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society 
 Any book that encourages child abuse is not Christian.  People who have responded favorably to this book may have been looking for something that agreed with their already held convictions, or maybe they have scared their child into obeying because they are bigger and stronger and thus feel they have found something helpful.  There are many good books on strong-willed children that are helpful in learning how to parent them.  This is not one.  He is selling books today because he was recognized years ago with writing a decent book on parenting.  There has been some tremendous change.  I would recommend parents NOT read this book. There are other ways of disciplining children that are not humiliating, violent and abusive.  If you are Christian, would Jesus have dealth with children in this way 
 Do not be duped by this hoax. The product came in a box that looked like a xerox copy of the real thing and the product did not function when plugged into either of my two computers 
 Do not buy this book.  It is one huge sales pitch for all of the other junk they are selling - books, games, DVDs.  No wonder they are so wealthy, they are getting rich on selling all of their nonsense, which tells you to buy some more nonsense!  They make a few good points, but those points are easily understood buy reading the FREE articles on yahoo finance by Kiyosaki.    Your money will be better invested if you stick it under your mattress.   
 This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book!  They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book...  What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be 
 This is a book about clear writing. Unfortunately, the significant thing that is missing in the book is the very clarity it seeks to promote. The authors seems to have invented an array of terms that are used not only inconsistently, but also interchangbly throughout the book. The authors warn the readers not to use too many terms to refer to the same concept, only to violate it summarily in this book. Also, the book has several complex passages -on subjects that are equally complex- that have been added to illustrate, according to the authors, key principles in omission. The authors then go on to revise the passages using their principles. This approach requires a mental feat that only a few determined readers will have the time to perform. First, a determined reader, if at all he is interested in knowing what's going on in a complex passage, must come to grips with the ideas expressed in the passage. Then he must remember the principles the authors are trying to illustrate and see how they have been mis-applied or omitted from the passage. If the determined reader has not dropped out of it altogether at this point, then he must now go on to the authors' revised passage and see how they have applied the principles to express the same idea clearly. At the end of all this, the poor but determined reader is left not with a clear illustration of a principle, but with a headache that will take a stiff dose of aspirin. Perhaps the authors should read their book and apply the principles to revise the book, and maybe it will result in a more readable book.  
 "The World According to Garp" is on my top 5 list of favorite books of all time.  It's one of those rare books that makes you laugh out loud, but still really feel the emotion of the characters, and the story really sticks with you.  (I made a joke about an Ellen Jamesian just the other day, lol ~ yes, it was a dumb joke that no one else got, but, that's how it goes sometimes :)  I was introduced to the book in college, well after the book and the movie were released, but I had never heard of either one.  I read the book in just a couple of days ~ I couldn't put it down, and I chatted it up with everyone who would listen.  I've re-read it several times since then, and i still think it's terrific.  Naturally, when i found out there was already a movie . . . I was thrilled!  I ordered it right away . . . but i wish i'd never wasted my money.  On it's own, the movie might be alirght.  But when you're invested in the book, when you know the characters, Robin Williams just isn't Garp.  I love Robin Williams, he's a great comedian, that's not a question.  I just think that the casting for this part was way off base.  and if you can't believe the main character, the rest of it's crap.   If you've never read the book, I highly recommend it!! 
 This is definitely not a book for those who really wants to learn mass transfer and unit operations. The author only skims through the important concepts and the examples are either over simplified or irrelevant. The example questions are full of mistakes and the answers provided are wrong. For the studious chemical engineering student who is interested to understand the important concepts of mass transfer, stay away from this book. This book totally mess me up. Now I am using Transport Processes by Geankoplis, which is in my opinion, more direct and conventional, and easy to understand than Cussler, who writes the textbook like a story book!! The Mass Transfer section in the book Transport Phenomena  by Bird also do better justice to this subject even though it is more suited for graduate students. My advice: Don't use this book if you want to grasp unit operations well 
 Sure, I had fun reading this book.  But the Amazon reviewer who termed it "highly speculative" is understating the case.  Opinion, conjecture, hearsay, and speculation too often take the place of thorough, solid documentation.  And unlike many other Amazon reviewers, I found McLellan's tone off-putting.  She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them "my girls," for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader.  Is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant?  You bet.  But is the topic of lesbianism in Hollywood well-served here?  I don't think so 
 As a Hornblower fan for many decades, I am very disappointed in this movie. Ioan Gruffud portrays a Hornblower who is almost a modern high school delinquent - the kind who walks in front of your car when you drive near a public HS to show he is "cool" or a "big man". Whereas this may appeal to someone who sports a "Question Authority" sticker, it is not the Hornblower I know. Overall, it seems that the movies did not do too well with one of the greatest heroes of fiction - but at least Gregory Peck's Hornblower was decent - this one is not quite the material from which a Commodore Hornblower is made... The kind of person portrayed by Gruffud is, above all, childish (as we all know, "cool" is the same as "cute"). Perhaps the other ones with this Ioan Gruffud are better, but these two are bad enough that they keep me from buying the others 
 I read this book hoping for some advice on how to deal with the perils of popular culture on kids.  Turns out it's not really about that, and I won't fault it for not being something it's not trying to be.    What I will fault it for is taking the "in order to be a good father, you need to be more like a mother" attitude that's so prevalent these days.  It focuses on getting guys to do the nurturing things that Moms are already doing, but it doesn't have much to say about being the actual Dad.  (Dads are different from Moms, and not just because they have gas)  The author spends a lot of time complaining about how pop culture stereotypes fathers as bumbling idiots-- which is certainly true, and it's a big problem-- but then fails to do much to counteract that stereotype.  Basically, it offers advice on how to trick people into thinking you're not really Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.  It treats the fatherhood duties as chores that you must do because they're expected of the modern man, but the underlying assumption, and maybe I'm reading something into it that's not there, is that you don't actually want to do them.  I think the biggest thing that stuck in my craw was the disrespect to pregnant wives I picked up in the early chapters.  The author tells you to be sensitive to her changing body, to make sure she feels beautiful.  Then it suggests that, if your wife's budda-esque physique doesn't "do it" for you, you should keep some pornography handy, of "use your imagination" to help get you in the mood for intimacy.  Boy, she'll really feel beautiful then!  On the whole, if you hadn't already figured this out, I didn't get much out of the book.  It wasn't what I expected, and it wasn't particularly good at what it actually was.  I found much of the advice to range between banal and insulting 
 This is a very uneven compilation of unreleased and rare home recordings, practice-space jams, comp tracks, and outtakes from 1982-1994.  Unfortunately after listening to this you'll know why most of this wasn't released before.  Its more of a collection of (mostly instrumental) sketches and half baked ideas than an actual album.  Of course their are some good songs such as "I Love You Peggy", or the 13th Floor Elevators cover "Earthquake", or "Endhoven Chicken Masque" but Humpty Dumpty LSD also contains a lot of absolute garbage such as "Night of the Day", a number played on acoustic guitar accompanied by unintelligible low pitched and unintelligible high pitched voices.  It's as boring a song as you can imagine.  Or the worst number "Perry Intro" which may or may not be the beginning to the song Perry that has been slowed way way down to a sludge like crawl.  I mean come on, this is the kinda crap that every kid with a tape player or digital delay has done since tape machines (or delays) were invented.  Big time yawn for that one.  Most of this album just isn't that interesting or groundbreaking, the quality of the "songs" isn't high.  In fact it's pretty low because this stuff wasn't intended for release.  Its like a Buttholes sketch book, not a finished work.  If that sounds interesting to you or if you are a die hard fan you may want to pick this up, otherwise avoid it or rip it from a friend 
 Usually, I don't waste my time reviewing something I can't stand. If I don't like it, fine, I'll keep it to myself. This situation, however, is a little different. I fell in love with Ra's music after stumbling upon their 05' release "duality" a couple months ago. That record was the perfect blend of hard/soft/unique rock with awesome vocals. Think Breaking Point meets Revis, and you have Ra's Duality. I was at best buy the other day to pick up the new SoCo side-project "everything in transit" when i came across "from one". Honestly, I didn't even know they had a past release until then. So, I got it thinking it would be just as good. It wasn't even close. First of all, the mixing and production is terrible and underbudget, and it totally kills the vocal melodies. Next, the songs are way to experimental for my tastes. I can't put up with a song that has no direction for 5+ minutes. Finally, what happened to the chorus'? The Ra I knew before "from one" did an awesome chorus, you know, the kind that make you sing outloud when you're on the freeway or in your room, the kind that make you love the rest of the song, even if the verses suck. Those chorus' are nowhere to be found on "from one". Of the 12 track arrangement, there are 2 or 3 songs I can enjoy, and the rest are terrible. "Fallen Rock Zone" and "Do you call my name" may be the worst songs I've ever heard in my entire life, and I USED to like bowling for soup!!! I'm not saying "duality" was flawless (it had it's moments), but it was something I could listen to over and over again, and really connect with. "from one" is no such album. I want my $10.99 back 
 Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
 This book, like most written and portraying Hurricane Katrina, leads the reader to the conclusion that New Orleans is the only area devastated thereby. For anyone's information, New Orleans was on the West, or weak, side of Katrina. New Orleans was flooded because: 1) elevation there is about 7 feet BELOW sea level and 2)their levy system has NEVER been built to withstand cat 3 or greater storms. EVERY drop of rain that falls in New Orleans has to be pumped out, one way or the other. If the citizens of New Orleans had put more money into improving their levy system instead of the SuperDome, they might very well be living in dry and undamaged homes today instead of morning their dead and trying to put their city back together. New Orleans will be rebuilt someday and I hope and pray that they have learned and benefited from this disaster and won't make the same mistakes again. If you want to read and look at a balanced book coverning Hurricane Katrina, this isn't it 
 In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism 
 I used this text for pre-med biology course-- I was simulataneously taking Biochemistry as well, but more on that later.  The text, while not overwhemingly as detailed as other reviewers write, was all in all okay, but fell short in many areas.  One of them is the distinct typographical and grammatical errors that riddled, what seemed, to be the only chapters we covered.  There were many sentences that were run-ons, which disrupted the learning and flow of the text (and, in my opinion, a textbook backed by such a major publisher as this, errors like that are out of the question).  Sometimes, for instance in the TCA chapter, I felt that the material presented on Oxidative Phosphorylation seemed out of order, and just a bit too condensed.  The photosynthesis chapter was utterly horrible.  The exercises at the end were poorly written, and seemed to ask esoteric questions about common topics.  The answers to these questions were esoteric still.  I felt that the only saving grace about this were the wonderful pictures: I liked how each chapter opened up an exhaustive diagram.  Other than that, this is book pretty much only a decent cell bio book, but no biochemistry one 
 I agree with the others in that this magazine is too content-filled with the most irrelevant content! The copy is way heavy, but few true words of wisdom. It showcases VERY little work by other graphic designers so if you're looking to peruse the latest talent, definitely stick with CA or HOW 
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 I bought this for my dad's birthday.  He is a fisherman.  This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen.  Not entertaining, not funny, not interesting, not even a fishing movie.  I bought it based on several reviews I read.  This is the first time I've been led astray on Amazon.  The "5 Stars" rating must be a review by people with a financial interest in this waste of digital energy 
 I bought the piece of junk from Amazon and I regret the day I started using Amazon. The machine did not work and the customer service of Amazon was the worst I have ever experienced. I will never ever shop Amazon again. 
 It's a silly action comedy that fails to make you laugh. 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 Having received an Amazon email indicating that I might be interested in this book, I thought I'd take a look, since the title sounded like something that might have some value. Without having actually read the book, but having perused the Amazon "peeks" inside, and the reviews here, I feel compelled to offer my own opinion.   From the cover photo, which presents a fifties-style, beautiful, perfectly-groomed, stereotyped woman, whose face takes up more cover space than the rather non-descript man, the agenda of the book is clear. The premise and arguments of this book are nothing more than right-wing, androcentric nonsense. Based upon my doctoral research in gender and power, the differences that Rhoads would like to take so seriously are differences that can all be attributed to imbalances in power, both interpersonally and culturally. Rhoads' argument seems to be that since it's "always been this way" and "look, everybody's doing it," then it must be the "right" thing. Well, those who have the power will do or say anything to keep it (or, "conserve" it, as conservatives are wont to do).   As a single mother who has raised a male child to be a warm, nurturing, verbally communicative, house-cleaning, clothes-ironing, picks-up-after-himself, listens-well-to-others, loyal, monogamous, baby-changing, kid-loving, hardworking, ambitious, sports-playing, car-fixing, tool-loving heterosexual man who has established secure, supportive attachments with men and women, I can attest to the mental and emotional health and social and interpersonal success of a child raised by a woman to be androgynous. As a parent this means nothing more than supporting and encouraging the full range of personal skills, talents and leanings that a child may have, in order to encourage a well-balanced human being who is able to effectively navigate life and its varieties of relationships. The true differences between men and women are small, and study after study has shown that the differences among women and among men are far greater than the differences between the sexes. Other studies show pretty clearly that persons higher in androgynous traits are mentally healthier. The right-wing reluctance to acknowledge this exacerbates the "war between the sexes" rather than alleviates it.  The title of this book gives the appearance that the work itself is serious research. That is the most frightening part of this book. This book is simply nonsense disguised as research propping up the right wing conservative efforts to keep both women and men in their traditional right wing, conservative  "places," neither of which truly benefits men, women, children or society at large.   However, the viewpoint of this book may offer comfort to people who hold on to the wish that their own childhood had included the cocoon of having grown up like Wally and the Beave did. Unfortunately, the fantasy families of the Cleavers, the Andersons and the Nelsons were just that- fantasies. 
 When I saw this book, i thought it was a good book for me.  but when  i began to read it (after i bought it), i noticed something that i hadn't before: this was a woman's book.  and not only a womens book, but a businesss  womens book.  i am not a woman, nor am i a business person, so i couldn't relate to the author AT ALL.  So, I wouldn't recomend this book to boys, guys, or men; nor would i recomend it to women that can't relate to business-type stuff (which i can't).  i feel bad that i wasted my money on a book written for the oppisite sex, but oh well... it was bargain price! My ratings is innaccurate for the appropiate adience of this book, though... 
 Packer is considered by many to be an excellent scholar, and with that said, about half of his chapters are well thought out, and quite good for the one or two pages he gives them. However, the problem starts in that the rest are steeped in Reformed traditions, and not necessarily, the plain revealed Word in Scripture. He relies too heavily on Augustine and Calvin instead of trying to work things out on his own. He sticks with the System. In many of his chapters, he comes across as arrogant and offensive to anyone who doesn't hold to his particular flavor of Reformed theology. He intentionally uses extreme and elitist labels to belittle other viewpoints. Packer, as with many of the High Calvinists, doesn't hesitate to put dissenters into any extreme category. In this book, Packer doesn't have to worry about being accused of being humble or irenic.   As a High Calvinist, he also continues the tradition of emphasizing the work of Law over Grace in sanctification. His other chapters are highly seasoned with Law as well. He has 3 chapters that emphasize Law and not one on Grace! Someone should give him a copy of Romans and Galatians. In addition, Packer doesn't hesitate to use only those verses which seem to support his position. The rest are ignored. If you buy into the dogmatic System of logic and Reformed traditions, over the plain Word of God, then this is the book for you. For the rest, please look elsewhere, or at least read it with an open study Bible that lists the verses that don't agree with him.  
 It is obvious from the responses here that this is simply a replication of the book in audio form.  I found myself mislead on the "Part II" on the cover - buyer beware 
 I was expecting a total new book to use in my classroom around Halloween. This one seems to reprint information from her first two books including some information on locations that is not correct. Has she actually been to any of those locations, I was misled. If your looking for a book on folklore than this is for you,otherwise save your money if you have her first two books.    
 I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash 
 I've been a reader of Georgette Heyer books for quite some time now and I adored most of her novels. However, I was really disappointed with this one. If you expect a traditional Heyer novel, you also will not like it very much. The story is boring and I really had a hard time continuing the book. However, if you're intersted in history, and especially in English history at Lord Wellington's time then you probably will enjoy the novel very much, because Heyer gives a very specific account of the war on the Iberian peninsula against the French. Nervertheless, it is not a novel that I would recommend 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 This is a deeply flawed memoir by a German who has yet to acknowledge the responsibility that Germans had for bringing about the Second World War.  The first 48 pages, which is all the memoir that Knell gives us, provides some insight as to what his remembered experiences of March 16-17, 1945.    Had Knell stopped there, this would have been a short personal memoir of life and death in Wurzburg.  But Knell plows on for another 286 pages.  He presents us with an incomplete and idiosyncratic view of aerial warfare in World War One, a history of the development of the theory of bombing, tactical and strategic, during the world wars that is cartoonish in its naivete, and a long jeremiad on the evils of the strategic bombing offensives by the RAF (mostly) in Europe, and the USAAF in the Pacific.  Along the way we are treated to such venerable chestnuts as his contention that the Allies at Versailles paved the way for the ascent of Hitler (did they also pave the way for Mussolini, whose Italy happened to be on the winning side in WW 1?), and that the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 was a pre-emptive strike against Soviet invasion armies massing on the Reich's easter border.    Knell mourns the loss of Germany's cultural heritage, while he notes primly that the Wehrmacht did not shell the cultural treasures in Leningrad during theie siege of that city.  Knell should be reminded that approximately the same number of civilians died in the siege of Leningrad as died in the entire Allied air offensive against Germany.  I hope some day that this unreconstructed Nazi can visit St. Petersburg and drive out to Piskaryovka Cemetery where over 600,000 victims of the Nazis/Germans are buried in mass graves.  Or should he prefer to stay in Germany, I'd suggest a trip to Dachau, Sachsenhausen, or Ravensbruck to jog his memory since he seems to have forgotten how evil the Nazis, and the German state at that time, were.  Was the Allied air offensive justified?  I suggest an affirmative answer, and note that a greater immorality would have been committed had the Allies not done everything in their power, in Europe and in the Pacific, to defeat Fascism, Nazism, and Imperial Japan.  
 This "mini-booklet" is basically a reiteration of the stages of grief set within a Judeo-Christian perspective.  One could probably stop by the local funeral parlor and pick up a free pamphlet that would be every bit as edifying.   Good grief, what a disappointment! 
 Educational advice from an unrepentant Weatherman/bomber of the '60s.  Not worth the trees destroyed to print it.  Avoid unless you are a rabid socialist 
 If I could have rated this book lower than 1 star, I would have done so in a minute!  In the 6 years that our book club has been together, I can think of only one other time that we ALL disliked a book so completely.  Specifically, we had trouble understanding the point of the book (other than good vs evil), found his writing to be pedantic, and his characters without depth.  I chose the book for our October read, to tie it in with Halloween.  I should have chosen Charlie Brown's Great Pumpkin 
 Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.  Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.  It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.  Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment 
 Somehow not up to her earlier work. The instrumental accompaniment is good, but tends to dominate at the expense of Cesaria's voice and the songs don't strike me as particularly memorable. One reviewer said this was perhaps the best thing she's done. If so, I just don't see it. I was disiappointed and found myself wondering if maybe her best days are behind her. I hope not 
 I listened to "Piece of Mind" religiously for almost two years.  It never left my disc changer.  "Concious" has two or three notable songs.  But it does not have the consistency of "Piece of Mind."  She seems to be aiming for commercial success.  She does not take as many risks with this one and there is too much filler.  
 This book's greatest flaw is, undoubtedly, its predictability.  It naturally has the descriptive and creative style of Scott, but the plot moves too logically from high point to high point with very little between.  There are very few "plot twists," and those which do occur are far from surprising.  From the book's outset, the story proceeds rapidly to the obvious tragic ending and seems to repeat regularly.  This ending also seems hurried and completely unbelievable.  The characters are poorly developed and, rather than seeming independent and realistic, seem to be nothing more than puppets forced to follow the extremely depressing plo 
 I am glad I only paid $60 for this.  I see it's now up to $90.   I am a bit disappointed in this purchase.  It does slice well so far (although I haven't tried slicing anything really thin like prosciutto yet) but I don't like the fact that I have to hold the on button down with one hand while cutting.    I also found that when I used it to slice homemade bread that the slices get stuck in between the blade and the plastic guide at the bottom, so I have to stop and dislodge each slice, sometimes tearing them in the process.    I also don't like how loud it is and the fact that it sounds like it is working REALLY HARD all the time.  It makes me question how long the motor is going to last.  The catch tray is really useless (as someone else pointed out) and in addition to not doing it's job it doesn't store inside or attached to the machine in any way, so it just kind of gets in the way.  If I decide to keep the machine I am going to throw it away.    So all in all, I gave it two stars because it is a CHEAP slicer (or at least it was at $60 I am not so sure at $90) but it works like a cheap slicer too, so you are definitely getting what you pay for.. 
 One of the great selling points of this book is the "15 commandments of writing." These rules and advice are terrific, but the book goes on to list many do's and don't's about the process of writing. Inadvertently, I think that the author has  done too much much to set down rules than to teach about inspiration  and creativity. On the other hand, many of her rules are soimewhat good and are based on solid principles of writing. At this price, you will be hard-pressed to find something similar besides "Writing Mysteries" by Sue Grafton, which is much better by fa 
 I agree with the premises of this book, but found it rather boring, and not the easiest to read. If you want to read something similar that doesn't read like a textbook, I would suggest "Losing Faith in Faith", "Atheist Universe" or "Like Rolling Uphill." 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 The title grabbed me because I have been noticing for, oh about 14 years now, the decline of the truth in this country.  Unfortunately, this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is (definition of irony I believe).  The reason it is #1 on the bestseller list is because there is a ready audience out there, of similarly detached people, who want anything (and I mean anything - a website with a good conspiracy story and a glass of warm milk before bed everynight is their ideal) that backs up their point of view.    It is precisely why the truth is so out of fashion.  New media streams like the internet, blogs, etc. offer up "news" without accountability.  They allow this segment of society to avoid confronting the truth and instead construct their own alternative realities.  It makes people like Frank Rich, rich, with very little effort.  Why bother checking facts, his core readership doesn't care whether it is true or not, just tell them Bush is evil 
 i bought this album because "boys of summer" got stuck in my head. i thought itd be something new and fresh. i struck out there. after the first song everything sounds repetitive. i got bored by song 4, since i somewhat enjoyed "in this diary". i wanted to enjoy it, i really did, but it just seemed so recycled. every song seemed to try and make teenage girls cry. im not a girl but the only time i contemplated crying was when i realized i couldnt get my 15$ back. sure it sounds a bit different from the run-of-the-mill stuff we're getting today, but not by enough. every verse and chorus could be played over one riff, its that identical. im all for a band keeping with its style, but that doesnt mean the style has to be narrowed down and boring. i wouldn't recommend this to many people. sorry, its just wea 
 This book might be a useful resource to scholars researching the history of the CIA's Science and Technology Directorate.  For the general reader, however, it is a tedious story of bureaucratic infighting that quickly becomes a chore to read 
 If you want to fall asleep in a hurry, stick the CD on.  If you want to hear any proper music, listen to something else 
 This book is not anywhere near the level of Bruce Bawer's While Europe Slept and Melanie Phillips' Londonistan, on the same general topic, the Islamization of Europe. Berlinski's writing is really a series of intermittently readable would-be magazine articles that, alas, were bound between book covers. In contrast to Bawer's book which skillfully ties each chapter to the Moslem problem in Europe, Berlinski fails to communicate with a unified voice and point of view. When she insisted at one point that she is definitely not saying most Moslems are disloyal, she lost me. Phillips wrote, on the contrary, that the evidence suggests most British Moslems support the terrorists. In the chapter on interfaith efforts by the mayor of Marseilles, Berlinski actually asks the mayor if his exclusion of an extremist imam from membership in the council is at odds with the spirit of the interfaith program. The mayor naturally took umbrage, and Berlinski failed to realize why her question was impertinent. She doesn't seem to know what she stands for, and neither does the reader. 
 I have long loved Mr. Jenkins' work and have adopted a few of his witty sayings as  my own.  It was work to read this one, but I toiled from respect for remembrances of things past.  Still a faithful fan, I look  forward to Jenkins' redemption 
 Do not expect their legendary voices in this CD 
 Is it me or did the author of the book in question most likely write that last review? The writer ran out and bought 5 copies to give to his friends? You have got to be kidding me.  I haven't read the book, it may very well be good, but I highly doubt that last review was by someone that is not connected somehow to profiting by this books sales.  I have read Giuliano's books before and have enjoyed them, but he is seen with such skepticism by most who know anything about the Beatles that I find it hard to believe that anyone not connected to the book would dish out such over the top praise as the last review.  
 Cobbled together from out-takes, B-sides and live tracks, STILL's major problem is its lack of focus. The first half seems designed as a  'rarities'-type collection, but mostly consists of unfinished studio demos.  There are some good songs, but the selection seems entirely arbitrary and is not comprehensive enough for the dedicated fan. The second half contains a recording of Joy Division's final concert,  and while some songs such as 'Means to an End' and 'Isolation' translate well to a live setting, this performance is marred by mistakes and poor sound quality. More interesting from a fan's viewpoint is the only live performance of 'Ceremony' with Ian Curtis on vocals; it is heavier and more direct than New Order's version.  STILL does contain a handful of songs such as 'Exercise One' that are difficult to find elsewhere, but the release of better compilations such as SUBSTANCE has almost rendered this album obsolete. It might have been a better idea to combine the unreleased 'Warsaw' songs with some of the better outtakes as a 'Complete Rarities' package. 
 This book reads like a graduate thesis. It manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments. Each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length, but I recommend not finding out for yourself; spend your money elsewhere 
 This book was terrible.  I couldn't believe how bad it was.  It was very out of date and made no sense.  The directions are very hard to follow and it doesn't give nearly enough details.  This didn't work for me at all.  My birdhouses kept falling apart!!!  I would highly suggest another book to replace this one, or better yet, you can have mine because I won't be using it 
 Not what I expected.  It wasn't as 'manly' as I had hoped 
 Much like Cunningham's first guide for the solitary Wiccan, this book was disappointing. There is very little of practical use, just a lot of hypothetical philosophy and a few contrived chants. Maybe that does it for some people, but for those who, there again, don't live in the middle of a secluded woods with unlimited access to natural items, the book offers nothing 
 I spent much of one grad school course being assailed by Barker's prognostications, which are essentially the entire body of Hegel's dialectical philosophy distilled to the lowest common denominator (Hegelian Cliff Notes?).  Once upon a time, western civlization had intellectuals, and now we have wonks.  Once upon a time, members of the business community were actually challenged to think, and now they are required to memorize trite management babble like "paradigm shift".  As a side note, one of the most incompetent executives I've ever met had, as a stock answer to any question that required contemplative thought, "that's a paradigm shift!".  Unfortunately for office brown nosers enchanted with Barker, other guru flavors-of-the-month have long since supplanted his musings, so you aren't likely to score any points 
 Our almost-4 year old son loves dragons and has one of the Imaginext dinosaur sets, so we thought we'd really surprise him on Christmas this year with the Imaginext dragon set.  While I'm very happy with how happy my son is with it (he's been playing with it for hours) I have a feeling we're going to be in much the same boat as some other reviewers.  Pros:  - Interesting color scheme - Good detail on most pieces - Re-configurable - The dragon figure is really neat - The trap door, rotating floor and other moving parts are a lot of fun for my son to operate - Got it on sale at the local Toys R' Us for 11 dollars less than listed on the web site.  Cons - The directions are picture-only, and much too small to see fine detail. - The pieces are not packaged together logically, so that the elements of the set are all in one bag. You have to open every bag and lay the pieces out in order to be able to find everything and even then there's some question as to whether you've got the right part turned the right way, per the above comment about the directions. - The whole thing comes tumbling down like a house of cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play. I've had to put it back together no less than 5 times since I initially put it together this morning. Some of the connector pieces don't fit tightly enough into the sockets on other pieces, so they tend to just slide out instead of locking together firmly.  I think that next year, we'll just stick to Legos 
 I have to agree with other reviewers who call this the weakest link in the trilogy. Its tone is very different from "Out of the Silent Planet" and "Perelandra". Those stories were magical, this one was... bewildering. I think the key is that the other two books were timeless, and still work today; but this one is too focused on a time and place (British society and universities in the 1940s) for most of today's readers to be able to connect to. If you want to finish the trilogy, this is worth reading once; but be prepared for something totally different from the first two books 
 This is garbage.  This "author" uses the term 'guys' for wiseguys.  It is sooooo anoying that I just had to stop reading it.  Use mafia, wiseguys, whatever.  Try reading the word 'guys' about 20 times a page and see how sick you are of it. this person was not a mob 'guy' so don't bother with this book.  as a matter of fact I will sell you mine very cheap 
 "Mr. Mani" is the story of a Sephardic family over a couple centuries, told via one side of conversations, and going backwards in time.  Both devices are hoary. I didn't believe for a second that the characters were of their own time. They were not even three-dimensional moderns. The prose alternates between plodding and precious. It's beyond me why this novel is well-respected 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 I hate to say this, but Child ripped the main structure of the plot, as well as the precise ending, from, of all things, an episode of KNIGHT RIDER titled 'Dangerous Maneuvers' from the fall of 1982. Everything is there: the army brats bonded together by accident,the love interest being not entirely white, the MPs dealing in crooked merchandise,one of the MPs being the father of one of the two main characters...but the weirdest part is the climax...I was sitting there in a state of shock, gasping at the tv,since right in front of me was the ending of The Enemy. Maybe it isn't exactly identical, but it's so close it's really strange...You won't believe it at first. I didn't. This was just yesterday too! The Sleuth network... Then I remembered that Child worked in TV for many years.  By the way, except for the baby face and easy smile, Hasselhoff would make a credible Reacher, he's about the right size. Too young, of course.  Anyway, it was very creepy.  It could be coincidence, but I doubt it. The climax is almost an identical scene. Yet I don't think it would be legally plagiarism, since there are dissimilarities as well. Interesting to think about. 
 Very disturbing book--on several counts. The flash backs in her other books orovided insight into the characters--how Beatrix had almost reached the point of no return, how Ian became a vampire, and why the poor guy needed counseling. All the flashbacks in this book provided was the fact that Stephan is a "bottom" without enough preservation to have a stopping point. I liked Ann, and I liked Stephan--in spite of the fact that he's an idiot. I wish Squires had spent more time on why someone who has lived for over 2000 years is too self-destructive to realize the so-called good guys are doing a head game on him.  Ann figured it out and she's been in an isolated area for 25 years. I also wanted more on Stephan's past--she dropped just enough hints to be annoying. On the whole, I thought two potentially good characters were wasted on nasty, destructive rape scenes 
 Despite its title, this book is not an in depth study of the battle at the Hot Gates. It is instead an overview of the Greco-Persian Wars as a whole -- starting pre-Marathon and ending post-Plataea. The action at Thermopylae is given but a few scant chapters. As much if not more space is accorded Artemisium and Salamis. You?ll learn less about Leonidas than about Themistocles. Perhaps the concentration on the Athenian fleet is not really surprising given that the author is a former navy man. However, one must wonder why then Bradford titled the book "Thermopylae".    But even as primer on the Wars, this book is a disappointment. It lacks both the political and tactical scope one finds in Peter Green?s far superior "Greco-Persian Wars". It is a pleasantly readable work to be sure and might make a decent introductory piece for a novice looking to aquaint himself with the period. For the rest of us, this book is well-trodden ground, adding no new insights.    Go for Green. Read this as an afterthought.     
 I bought this book based on reading others' reviews of how great it was, how the author's storyteling "pulls you in from the start & never lets you go." Others gave the impression that it was helpful to those going through a difficult time. I have to say - I don't get it. It was very short (I read it in less than an hour) and kind of pointless. The basic point of the story is that God is a mystery, and we don't always know why he lets certain events happen. Yeah, I get it already. Have since I was little. I can't believe I spent $10 for this book.  
 Like many others here, my CD-changer died after a couple of weeks and it wouldn't read any CD. It's in for repair, but they say the changer part is on National back order and they don't know when they will be available. No surprise, I guess given the number that are breaking. The JVC parts web site says the changer is not available for "more than 3 weeks." I hope they will replace my unit with something that works 
 Overly predictable story about a high school spaz who inherits a billion dollar porn company where apparently all the women don't take their clothes off too much.    The crude AMERICAN PIE - style humor at the beginning is pretty funny but then it sinks into the goofy NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE territory and that got old quick.  Add on a true meaning of friendship ending and you'll be praying for the end.  WHO'S YOUR DADDY? should have stuck to one direction and went with it instead of failing at fifteen.  Ali Landry is hot but I think Marnette Patterson is hotter.  Neither gets naked, or even close.   
 too bad that such an important subject was handled in such a biased way.  even worse is that the facts were either only particaly used or twisted to fit the point mr. toobin was trying to make at the time.  everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.  this book should classified as fiction and not non-fiction 
 The problem that I have with this book is that often the words that it defines tells me to go look up another fine.  That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word.  This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows.  So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good 
 I bought this book many years ago and read it through. I was quite disappointed by the treatment of textual criticism given. The book reads like an advertisement for the critical texts that they have put out. It did not provide solid scholarly arguments to support their choice of manuscripts and methodology in making their textual evaluations. Many papyri are listed and classified according to their accuracy but no explanation or justification for the supposed authority of these texts are supplied - apparantly you're just supposed to believe the Alands and not question it any further. This book left me the impression that modern critical textual scholarship is an arbitrary and subjective endeavor lacking firm, testable scientific premises and is driven rather by personal preference and prejudice 
 I was disappointed when my anxiety turned into depression. Clearly the fault lies in the main composer as he is totally oblivious of the south Indian classical music structure. Indian classical music has certain norms  and standards that are to be followed. When Srinivas restricts himself to a  particular raga, Brooks with his so called infinite guitar touches  "unmelodic scales" and finds himself aimlessly playing his  instrument. I must admit that Srinivas has however played his part very  well. Whoever sang the alap for the last song, i must say that he has to  better his skills in it 
 David Von Drehle had it right, the Triangle Fire is one of the great American tragedies and a great story. But Drehle takes an almost scientific approach to a story about people. Padding out the book to make it novel length (The appendix is nearly 1/3 of the page length) he so often repeats himself and circles back on the same information, over and over and over again.  Detail in such a tale is good, but Drehle is so caught up with just how many sewing machines are on each table he loses sight of WHY this story is so compelling.  The actual story of the fire is retold no less than nine times from nine different perspectives. And any time the book advances Drehle yanks it back to circle back on itself. Drehle might be a good archivist but he's a poor novelist.   I grew up on tales of the Triangle fire as my great grandfather was one of the men who went up to the roof to escape the fire and his stories were always rivetting...Drehle's aren't. DO NOT Recommend this book. It's a huge disappointment! 
 Seven seconds, is about how long you want to watch this piece of garbage!  No wonder I've never heard of this movie, it's a disaster!  Almost every movie I've seen Wesley Snipes in is good.  So I figured I was going to see a decent movie when I rented this. WRONG!  It's very hard to understand, exactly what's going on in this movie. It was dragged out, and just plain ridiculous!  Every review on Amazon for this movie so far is bad, we can't all be wrong 
 What a disappointment!  I requested this book for Christmas, but after about 125 pages I pitched it.  In addition to bad writing, it became clear the author had a political agenda in writing it.  Not that injecting personal points of view is inappropriate; T.H. White does it brilliantly in his Once and Future King and Book of Merlin. It's just that the worldview Jack Whyte advocates is adolescent, ignorant and simplistic.  I won't know how Whyte will treat the complex mythopoeic stories of Merlin and Arthur; I hope with a lot more depth and nuance than he began his series 
 Elaine Risley was bullied by her friends as a child and was scarred forever after. Pile up as much philosophing and moralizing as you want, in the end what you are left with here is more than 400 pages filled with a depressing middle-aged woman's memories of her miserable childhood and bullying friends. Paragraph upon paragraph upon paragraph of childhood angst.  What twaddle. Dreary, dreary, dreary. 
 We received this book as a gift for our 3 yr old.  I read it to her and it was really disturbing.  Other reviews have noted that it must be read "in context" as far as the time it was written.  I disagree - when was a child's viewing a mother's brutal murder (Babar seeing his mother being shot before his eyes)  ever appropriate fare for a little child?  Then, Babar has to run for his life and later on in the book, there is another death.  Also, Babar is surprised when his cousins have no clothes - this is upsetting to him.  I find it offensive - elephants don't need to be like people - they don't need clothes.  I don't see the charm in this book at all.  I don't see the attraction.  One thing -- Babar marrying his cousin is the one thing that is not shocking - its not like incest, like brother and sister or like they grew up together -- people have been marrying cousins for thousands of years - up until at least the beginning of this century - hardly immoral 
 On Sunday morning, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson told TV viewers nation-wide that the threat posed by liberal judges is "probably more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings." When an incredulous George Stephanopoulos asked if Robertson really believed that these judges posed "the most serious threat America has faced in nearly 400 years of history, more serious than al Qaeda, more serious than Nazi Germany and Japan, more serious than the Civil War?," he responded, "George, I really believe that." 
 Kenneth Roberts Deepening Democracy? The Modern Left and Social Movements in Chile and Peru (Stanford, 1998)  Dr. Roberts is a professor of Political Science at Cornell University and has spent the last 15 years studying and lecturing about leftist politics in Latin America.  This book is essentially an outgrowth of his dissertation from 1992, "In Search of a New Identity: Dictatorship, Democracy, and the Evolution of the Left in Chile and Peru."  In this book, Dr. Kenneth Roberts chronicles the path of the socialist and communist movements in Chile and Peru over the last century.  He pays particular attention to the transformation of the Socialist and Communist parties in Chile immediately from 1970 until the early 1990s.  While the title purports to investigate both Chile and Peru, the bulk of the book revolved around the Chilean experience; a mere 67 of 300 pages was dedicated to Peruvian politics.  Thus, a reader looking for Peruvian insights may be disappointed. However, he juxtaposes both Chile and Peru because of the relative success of leftist parties in Chile and Peru; Chile has one of the more successful experiences while Peru ranks as one of the least successful.   In his forward, Dr. Roberts states, "I offer no magical solutions or bold prescriptions to resolve the dilemmas of the partisan Left and social movements in Latin America.  My more modest hope is that his book might contribute to a clearer understanding of the nature of these dilemmas so that they may one day be tackled more effectively."  Thus, he lays out his observation of existing leftist parties in Latin America and his prescriptions for them to improve their political lot in Latin American nations.   First Dr. Roberts lays out his political theory of `deepening democracy' and `extending democracy.'  Simply put, the deepening process is a solely political process where more people participate in government, and the extending process is one where democratic processes continue in social or economic spheres.  Both of these processes are necessary because these nations do not have long histories as democratic entities.  However, he focuses on the deepening as especially important throughout the book.   He bemoans the fact that this deepening process also dilutes the fervor that some political organizations can wield.  For example, the Socialist Party in Chile has changed its tactics from an outside revolutionary party to one that has agreed to live within the rules laid down by the exiting Chilean autocracy.  In contrast, the Communist party in Chile has evolved into a more revolutionary stance and is unwilling to compromise its core beliefs.  As a result, the Socialist Party has deepened itself while also diluting its former power base.  This phenomenon is essentially the `big tent' theory of American political parties; parties need to branch out from their core constituencies to reach the center.  While branching out, they risk alienating the same core constituencies that form their foundation of support.   Roberts left out some key explanations regarding the Communist Party's challenges in Chile.  He implies that the Communists have been denied participation in the last ten years solely because the centrist Christian Democrats will not allow the communists to participate in their coalition.  A more probable reality is that the Christian Democrats will not willingly include a revolutionary party in their governing cabinet, especially one that has continued to campaign for a revolutionary overthrow of the existing government.  For this reason and many others, the Communist Party has been unable to capitalize on the removal of Pinochet.   In his description of Chile's success since Pinochet's departure, Dr. Roberts never intimates that the dictator's legacy could be partially responsible for the continued success of the Chilean democracy, only that these conservative institutions impede the progress that the left desires for Chile.  In other words, it is anathema to him that the socialists and Christina Democrats might actually be less successful without the neo-liberalism in Chile and without the constitutional impediments to the left's social agenda.      Dr. Roberts also leaves out some key economic information in his book, which leads to suspicion.  For example, all of his economic data, such as "Evolution of Employment and Unemployment in Chile" and "Main Economic Indicators for Chile," start in 1973.  A better economic analysis would have shown at least 5 years prior to Allende's government, which started in 1970.  Roberts simply does not show the reader the economic depths to which Allende plunged the Chilean economy during his presidency.  Thus the reader is forced to either ignore this economic reality or perform research outside the book.  We are left with the following description regarding Allende's economic performance on page 93: "...the economy stagnated and inflationary pressures accumulated as consumption surged, investment and productivity plummeted, international credits dried up..."  In contrast, he carefully notes each economic setback suffered under Pinochet such as this statement on page 121: "...when a financial crisis plunged Chile into the worst recession in its modern history, causing the economy to shrink by nearly 13 percent in 1982-1983."  The reader is left to ponder whether or not the economic crisis of 1973 was better or worse than the crisis of 1983, and also must ponder what year marks the start of Roberts's `modern history' of Chile.  While these omissions may seem trivial, examples abound throughout the book and weaken his argument.  A more analytical analysis might have provided weaker support for Roberts's arguments, but it would have been more intellectually honest.     With this and several other omissions, it is obvious that Dr. Roberts is more concerned with advancing the political fortunes of leftist political parties in Latin America than he is with actual progress in these nations.  On page 1 he states, "The shallowness of these regimes (new democracies) can be seen in democratic procedures...and the accentuation of socioeconomic inequalities that mock the formal political equality of democratic citizenship."  Thus he shows his disappointment that these nations have not more quickly evolved into social paradises with more equal representative governments and a more socialized distribution of wealth.  He obvious holds the military dictatorships of Cuba and Nicaragua in high esteem while disparaging all other military dictatorship in the region.   In other words, Roberts is characteristic of several Latin American scholars and Latin American studies programs in the USA.  All in all he cites more than 464 works and nearly 600 footnotes.  Not one of these footnotes or published works apparently has a good thing to say about neo-liberal economics in Latin America over the last 50 years.  At the same time, not one of these footnotes seems to be critical of the military dictatorships in either Nicaragua or Cuba.  This book is hardly a balanced account of how nations can grow using at least some principles from either the classical or even modern day neo-liberal economic models.  This disparity is even more surprising when noted in the light of the Soviet Union's Perestroika and the fall of Eastern European communism that occurred in 1989.  In short, if you want a one-dimensional perspective of a United States academician regarding the leftist parties in Latin America, then this is the book for you.        Post script:  I had to smile and copy this passage from the book when I read it,   "The enduring irony of the Chilean Left is that those who most persuasively articulated a theoretical vision for the deepening of democracy through the political protagonism of collective popular subjects have been the least connected to such subjects in practice." (p. 121)   This real irony of this statement is that the entire book was a persuasively articulated vision for deepening democracy, written by a tenured professor in the United States, whose primary connection to the Chilean left appears to be his writings and occasional visits!    
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 I was absolutely thrilled with volumes 1-4 in this series. This was, stylistically, more jazzy than chill. It has been a couple years since they released a chill colection. I think that after the feedback they got on this one, they gave up. Nooooo- Just bring back the producers on 1-4 
 I found this book to be extremely depressing and full of despair, which someone who has lost a child doesn't need to feel more of.  This book offered no hope and must have been written by authors who believe they will never see their children again.  I refuse to look at life and death that way and instead choose to have hope of reuniting with my daughter and peace in knowing that she is in a much better place than we are.  Obviously I would not recommed this book for anyone who has lost a child.  
 Calling Cards... Long gloves vs Afternoon Tea gloves... How to prepare a proper wives luncheon complete with quiche???? WHO DOES THIS!!! As an Enlisted wife (And I find that most of the wives looking for help ARE Enlisted) you are going to wind up chucking this book right into the trash. The place on base that people keep mentioning as being useful is the Family Support Center. They have FREE reading material that is 400 times more useful than knowing what kind of gloves to wear to lunch. WHO WEARS GLOVES TO LUNCH?!! Half of the wives I know who "do lunch" end up showing up in jeans so where do the gloves come in??? I gave this to my best friend who is an Officers Wife, thinking that the Upper Crust might do these 50's style luncheons more than us enlisted people... as it turns out, they don't "do lunch" with gloves either.   Seriously, if you're COMPLETELY new to the military, this might help you learn some of the traditions. But it gives you the WRONG idea about what the military is like and, in all honesty, I've been married for several years now, was a brat before that, and the only pair of gloves I own are for winter weather. And the only reason I even HAVE calling cards is because, as a Jew, I'm forbidden to write on the Sabbath and sometimes I want to give my number to a new friend. I have never once needed more than the back of a reciept and a pen to give my number to other military wives, I have never served quiche at a get together and don't know anybody who actually EATS the stuff outside of their parent's house, And   If it's history and tradition you are looking for.. there are WAY more books out there to give you an insightful look at the military. If you're in your 50's, married to an officer, and you're the type to "do lunch" in a formal setting, you will get off on this book. But if you're anything like me (an Enlisted wife under 30) you're better off just going to the FSC, a library, or a Spouses Club meeting for all of the information that's in this book. Also, it helps to MEET the wives because then you will see that they are not a group of hat wearing, quiche eating old biddies who do tea. 
 Though lacking good directions, this was straightforward to assemble.  However, it is flimsy and tilts whenever I lean on it ever so slightly.  I am getting rid of it.  
 I guess I missed the point. I can see how this film could be considered a horror "classic". I'm sure the violence was ground breaking in 1972... in fact, one of the comments in the "making of" on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres. I don't think it's a well done film overall... it's lacking in story, music, direction, and suspense. The acting is not too bad, but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes. If I was craving some good 1970's horror, I'd rather watch "I Spit on Your Grave" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" 
 Listening to this CD will give nothing more than a good idea of what is wrong with most rap music today. It is nothing but ignorant rhymes and annoying beats. If you already have this CD, I have found that it makes a good doorstop 
 I knew there were two aliens/UFO camps: those who believe we're being visited by aliens, and those who don't believe we are. I hadn't realised there was a third camp: those who believe these "aliens" are demons. For those willing to swallow the existence of demons in the first place, I guess this is great news for them.  For a rational treatment of the alien abduction phenomenon in modern society, read "Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped by Aliens" by Susan A. Clancy, and of course Carl Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World" 
 Just for the record, my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier Casio models. Presently in Iraq, I do want to have a camera with me, but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service. Sad. It looked to be a great camera 
 I was terribly disappointed with this King release.  Could a creative writing student done better?  Perhaps.   It was by far the worst published work I've ever read.  It was unreadable.  Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed.  The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere.  The book seemed to be published on his name alone.  I have been disappointed in S. King  for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch.  I am a long time fan, I began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book I read, written by him, was Hearts In Atlantis.  
 I've really enjoyed the past books in this series but this one was a big disappointment. The story line was severly lacking and the political and social issues the author included were misplaced. Even though I agree with most of the authors views, I didn't like the way they were forced into the story and were so out of character with the prior books in the series.  
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 I'm sorry, I love Gina Gershon and I was looking forward to watching this movie since I do like action films. But this is such a run of the mill martial arts flick. I wasn't even intrigued to watch the whole thing without hitting the fast forward button through most of the show.  The basis of this movie - the main character is an expert martial artist who comes to town just as a rising of an Aryan militia becomes prominent nearby. It starts with them killing the black preacher everyone loves who promotes people to stop hate, and the white boys in the militia don't like that. *gasp, I never would have guessed*  Main character kicks everyone's behind, gets the girl, acting is horrible and the plot could be pasted to any B flick action film.   Your time could be better spent watching paint dry. Or if you're desperate for something like this then watch Universal Soldier, at least it was funny 
  I think Grant Wood's painting "American Gothic" created in 1930 is a great piece of art (not only American but in a world's scale). Having read the synopsis for this movie I thought it'd be something really interesting. I guess I was wrong. First you got to understand it's not quite a movie. It's more like a collage of photos and images put on industrial and death metal music. The movie is surreal and abstract unlike the painting itself. I doubt it's possible to understand anything watching it. Maybe some will be exclaiming "Ingenious! Brilliant!" after the film but then they have to be big connoisseurs of post-modernistic art. Carlos Batts is an acclaimed photographer, photography is his first speciality and I somehow missed it before buying this DVD. I think this film would be a nice part of some contemporary art exhibition, among some weird statues and installations. But to pay $23 for watching it at home - no, that's too much, and I'm talking not just about the money.  Don't say you haven't been warned :) 
 Iowa workshop anthology with a few other usual suspects as well as other signs of nepotism.  How sad.  Shuffle the pages and look at the cards: you've got only one suit 
 As brevity is the soul of wit, let me be brief.  First of all, I found reading this book to be an arduous task.  I feel the same way that Joseph Conrad did, namely, I saw no emotion in it. Let me take just one sentence out to illustrate: "...in order to distinguish in...Gilberte an indefinable quality analogous in the world of the emotions to what in the world of colours is called infra-red, my parents would have needed that supplementary sense with which love had temporarily endowed me."  I imagine that if I were to write this sentence, my writing instructor's red ink comments would be "Wordy, awkward, over intellectual".  Compare Proust's sentence with how John Steinbeck expressed the same sentiment: "Once, when I raptured in a violet glow given off by the Queen of the World, my father asked me why, and I thought he was crazy not to see. Of course I know now she was a mouse-haired, freckle-nosed, scabby-kneed little girl with a voice like a bat and the loving kindness of a gila monster, but then she lighted up the landscape and me".   This pretty much sums up my reaction to this book.  I cannot recommend it to anyone, no matter how famous the book is and no matter if it won the Prix Goncourt, and no matter how intelligent Proust was, and no matter how many people say they wouldn't have wanted to go to their grave without having read it.  All I can say is, Read it, and see for yourself why you shouldn't read it (paraphrasing Samuel Goldwyn).

 Lethargic but prescient novel about dull, spoiled American leisure class brats in trouble: a blueprint for the Reagan Irrevolution & the Bush-Clinton wastrels & wastrelettes 
 This doesn't include Rude Mood in either studio or live version, Travis Walk, Riviera Paradise, or any of his other unbelievable instrumental guitar workouts.  This compilation is a serious waste of money.  Virtually any album he put out would be better by itself than this compilation, especially Texas Flood or In Step.  Better yet by far, though, would be to get "The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble."  It's bargain priced, and contains every song you could want or expect, including the excellent, posthumously-released acoustic blues song, "Life By The Drop."  SRV is a guitarist worth discovering, but this compilation won't show you anything 
 I know I read this book and I remember raving about it to preety much everyone I met 2 years ago.  For the life of me I cannot remember what the book was ABOUT.  That is the feeling you will get when you read this book kinda like Chinesse food, a great feeling and something you want to tell your friends about but ultimity forgetable 
 I sorta of agree with the person below, This album sucks....plain and simple, however I think he is still doing a great job in Rhapsody.  I gave it one star not so much because it is garbage, but becuase I was looking forward to this album since "Prophets of the Last Eclipse"  Which was great, but trully...I don't know went wrong.  I don't have a problem with female vocalists, but in this album...it is retched.  I don't think I will ever listen to this album ever again.  Sorry!  But its true...do not buy this album, pretend you never knew he had a new album...OH!  and do NOT buy Luca Turilli's Dreamquest either!  Another bomb 
 Wishes was not only what I was looking for but even better,  Great for a disney song collectot 
 Be careful with this book... if you're looking for a book with just raw recipes this isn't a good choice.  There are many cooked recipes in this book.  If you are simply looking for a healthy cookbook with some raw recipes this may be a good choice for you 
 Very disappointed to get this book which has no bar code and clearly appears to be "home project" of copyright violation: Poorly bound with delayed delivery. As a collector of books, any one would be disappointed to get this wreck of disjointedly bound, unauthentic appearing copy of a book. I have contacted the publisher to investigate a possible copyright violation. It is a shame that Amazon.com is the cybervehicle of such books!

 If you are a Christian looking for information about certain Bible topics then this dictionary is not for you.  There are even some sections where the author doubts the validity of Scripture and claims that there are faults in the Word of God.  If you are looking for wishy-washy details then this is the book for you.  If you believe the Word of God is just that THE WORD OF GOD, then don't buy this dictionary.  There are so many other Bible dictionaries out there that will be of much more help and guidance.  My suggestion to all....give this one a miss 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 I debated whether or not I should write a review.  After all, I only read the first 70 pages or so, after which I decided to stop slogging through this tedious novel.  However, since I assume most people who would buy and read this book are doing it for their own enjoyment, I felt complelled to chime in, although I'm clearly in the minority.  However, I must add in my defense that this book was initially criticized by his contemporaries as a short story that just kept rambling on with no apparent purpose, a criticism I find valid.  The premise sounds fascinating - the journey of a young seaman who attempts to reconcile his dishonorable past.  It sounded like it would be an interesting tale about the conflict between heroics and harsh reality.  However, in the delivery of the story, I lost all interest shortly.  The main problem I see is in the vivid descriptions and imagery.  This, or course, is usually a good thing.  However, Conrad seems to go into such great description of every little detail that it distracts from the main story.  It seems that Conrad could have been just as effective by using half of the words.  The non-sequitur narrative also makes it a bit more difficult to follow, although I think this could have been effective if the narrative would have been more concise and to the point.  However, rather than merely blasting away at "Lord Jim," I will at least give one alternative - "Heart of Darkness", also by Joseph Conrad.  Read my take of this in my other reviews.  This is a much more interesting and more enjoyable read than "Lord Jim", and about half its length.  Plus, it offers a more poignant picture of Imperialism and its ideals (or lack thereof).  Perhaps I will give it another go in the future, but until then I would recommend you give "Lord Jim" a pass and spend your money and time on another novel, perhaps "Heart of Darkness. 
 Words are inadequate to describe my overwhelming, crushing disappointment in this book--and my astonishment at the audacity of Backbeat Books in publishing a "Gospel Music Encyclopedia" that so utterly fails to meet the expectations raised by those words.  The Dixie Hummingbirds are probably the most world-famous vocal group in the entire history of gospel, with many hundreds of recordings from 1939 well into the rock era.  They are ENTIRELY ABSENT from this book.  Yes, really, I'm not joking; my jaw dropped open when I discovered it.  The Swan Silvertones are another of the most beloved groups in gospel history, with their "Oh Mary Don't You Weep" one of the candidates for greatest gospel record ever; they're nowhere to be found here.  Incredible but true. The Rev. Gary Davis is an all-time gospel legend having originated many well-loved classic songs; the authors apparently never heard of him.  The recordings of Washington Phillips have been influential on generations of gospel artists; he, too, is missing in action.  I suppose we should consider ourselves fortunate that Mahalia Jackson made the cut.  The more accurate subtitle of this book should be "The Encyclopedia of Gospel Performers from 1970 to Today, plus a Small Number of Gospel Performers Before 1970."  Recorded gospel music goes back more than 100 years, but the authors are apparently either ignorant of this rich history, or simply don't care about it. Did anyone actually edit this book who knew the first thing about gospel music history?  I feel badly for the great Mavis Staples, who wrote an introduction for this book that totally ignores many of the artists who were crucial inspirations for her career.  I'm sure she's deeply embarrassed at having her name associated with this abomination, this travesty.   Yes, there is some useful information here on modern-era gospel performers and a very small number of earlier greats.  But for those of us who had been waiting for years for a true gospel music encyclopedia and ordered this book believing this was it, "Uncloudy Days" is a cruel deception and a horrendous disappointment. Buyer beware.   I only hope that before too long someone else will publish a true, historically accurate gospel music encyclopedia.  Because this, most emphatically, is NOT it.   Steve Sulliva 
 I struggled with how to start this review.  How do you describe a book that attempts to teach scripting to (and I quote) networking consultants, network administrators, MCSEs or anyone familiar with "basic Windows Server administration" yet spends time telling you how to use Notepad to open a script file?  How about making up your own name for script sections that no one in the industry will understand if you ever say it to them ("Worker information section" for example)?  Worse yet, a book that attempts to teach you the basics of the language by using external COM object references from the very first script instead of solidifying the base language with the base language first?    After reading dozens of self-paced learning guides on scripting as well as designing and teaching my own course work on the subject, I have a good idea what will make someone new to a topic frustrated and confused.  As an example, demonstrating a script on page 5 that reads from the registry using an external COM object followed by a long table on page 13 that lists registry locations where readers can pull such information as the Exchange 2000 domain user, but NEVER formally covering the object used to read from and write to the registry - is a great way to aggravate and alienate a student.   What readers new to VBScript and Windows scripting will never find in this book is a straightforward introduction to the language, coverage of the Windows Script Host (WSH) itself, or a good reference for the native objects commonly used for Windows scripting.  A dedicated reader may find that the book does introduce them to scripting, but most will find that they will need to purchase a second book to fill in the missing pieces and/or to use as a language reference later on.  The author obviously knows the topic, but fails to efficiently convey that information to his readers.

 Seems much more about cognitive therapy than behavioral.  I'm familiar with Linehan's model which seems, to me, truer to the behavioral paradigm of holding your thoughts, beliefs, and feelings while acting differently.  Linehan puts the dialectic between behaviors and private experience in the Buddhist sense of "walking with both things together."  The dialectic for Marra is between "hopelessness and hopefullness," "safety and freedom," "despair and inspiration," and "resignation and initiative" (to take a few examples from the book).  I think this misses the point entirely.  Whether you're looking for self-help or materials to assist with your clinical practice, check out some of the materials from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Steven Hayes, Kelly Wilson, Kirk Strosaahl, etc.) or Linehan's workbook for DBT with BPD (you don't need Borderline Personality D/O to benefit from her fabulous work).    
 Going through Pilgrim at Tinker Creek with Annie Dillard I observed her skillful employment of imagery and figurative language. The use of personification, similes and metaphors elevates this relatively boring story to a kaleidoscope of color and exploration. From a frog being sucked dry to peaceful eye to eye night on the rocks with a copperhead snake, Dillard excites and dramatizes with unique sentence structure and personal anecdotes. The book is pregnant with telegraphic sentences and a recurring circle effect of topics. For the skillful writing and deep thought, I hold a certain admiration and understanding of this book's praise. However I see little else to justify Pilgrim at Tinker Creek's winning of a Pulitzer Prize. 	Dillard's knowledge of other prevalent literature and religious books is highly noticeable throughout Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. She alludes to the Bible quite a few times in addition to the Korean and many other works, including her predecessor, Henry David Thoreau. Oddly enough, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek bears an uncanny resembles to Thoreau's Walden. However Dillard's book lacks the same exploration into intellectual philosophy. Both books delve into the natural world with real lust for knowledge and superior curiosity. The book has a short fall, in that it lacks any real substance. Full of fleshy descriptions it lacks any real soul of a thesis. Compared to Walden it is essentially similar, but Walden at least has some relevant information about human nature. 	So if the microscope study the natural world is a good read, then this book is for you. The details in the book on insects are fairly cacophonous, which includes the mating ritual of the praying mantis. I cannot see how the book is enjoyable, except for those harboring a deep love of nature. For everyone who does not fit into the extreme nature category it probably will not be very catchy, but it will of essence capture an admiration for its style and imagery 
 This is certainly an impassioned defence of beauty, and a 'feel-good' book, but it is so lacking in substance is barely counts as a contribution to the debate. It's incoherent at many levels, most notably concerning the switch from the accepted idea in part one that beauty is always particular, to the claims in part two that it is a function of certain qualities, especially symmetry. Asthetic symmetry promotes ethical justice? The idea of beauty as enlivening is also too simple. This is not good enough as a theory of the link between aesthetics and ethics. The account of the so called 'political complaints' against beauty is a set of caricatures. There is also a very weak accounts of Matisse, whose Nice paintings are regarded by Scarry as stand ins for real windows and real palm trees; some sense of what modernist art has done to the concept of beauty and why is needed here. There are many better books on the topic. 
 From reading the reviews of Santa Evita, one might actually conclude that the book is about her, about her life or about her times.  And that would be a mistake.  This novel is fundamentally about itself, making constant references to the writing of it, other writings, other authors, the process of writing, and other writings of this author.  I found the transitions out of context and jarring, as though I was being suddenly reminded that I was reading a book.  After a while, I found the de-constructing of Evita to be tiresome and not very original.  The subject of Evita Peron's life is an extremely colorful, bizarre and fascinating story in and of itself.  Somehow, I felt that the author had utilized this famous and powerful legend to manipulate the reader.  The segments of the narrative which are more "straight" and not self referential, are extremely compelling.  Then suddenly, I felt I had been caught in a mouse trap of deconstructionist trickery, and that Martinez had "used" his purported subject as a piece of cheese to lure me in.  Not nice.  
 I started reading this book, skipping the introduction and then realized this isn't the Tao Te Ching at all. This is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said, and so he wrote his own version. It turns out the author admits this in the introduction. I wish I had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk. I guess I should have taken the hint with the "A New Version" doublespeak on the front cover. Sigh. I usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs.      
 I know H. James is considered one of the "Greats" of American literature and I question my taste for hating most of his writing.  With few exceptions I think he is  a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism.  I read Wings of the Dove many years ago in the days when I would not allow myself to set aside books I did not enjoy.  I recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why I disliked him so much.  Now in my old age I had no pangs of conscience when I happily closed the book before finishing it.  If more of the stories had been like Daisy Miller I would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of Wings.  I am currently seeking  relief from Henry's turgid prose by reading Hemingway.  I'd trade in a Henry  for an Ernie any day.  It's also difficult to like Mr. James' snobbish, shallow and unsympathetic characters.  The more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style.        
 This account of the life and love affair of Henry Miller and Anais Nin seems endless.  The director attempts to show character traits and development via an endless parade of sexual liaisons, which becomes more than tedious after the first hour and a half of the movie.  Henry, June, and Anais deserve better 
 As a professional interior designer who is now ready to start my own business, I found this book of little use. The author seems to think anyone can become an interior designer just by reading this one book.  I strongly disagree 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 Sounds up to date, and I bought it thinking it new, but tired forecasts from 1990 can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of 2000. Avoid and think for yourself instead 
 I'm sorry, but this album is by NO MEANS a classic. Just because it has NWA stamped across the cover does not make it good. Just because it is the early origins of NWA does not make it good. If you are a diehard NWA fan it's worth owning, but I'm not gonna tell people "You have to own this, it's so good". Because it's not. Let me show you how this review should really go 1.Boyz N Tha Hood-Early version, worth owning if you want to hear the first version of it 2.8 Ball-Another early version. Also the "clean" version, aka sucky version. Honestly, did anyone favor NWA songs without all the four letter words? 3.Dunk the Funk-Fila Fresh Crew is a horrible band. I can see why the DOC left 4.A B is A B-Good song, not an early one like the rest of the album. Notice how they removed the sh*tty Rappenstein song and replaced it with this? 5.Drink it up-This is just plain stupid. What the hell were they thinking? 6.Panic Zone-Prime example of why no one has ever claimed Arabian Prince to be their favorite member of NWA (his mother does not count) 7.LA is the Place-This is flat out annoying 8.Dopeman-early version, worth hearing if a big NWA fan 9.Tuffest man alive-AKA Worst Band Ever 10.Fat Girl-Funny if you listen to it once and never again 11.3 The hard Way-Even if this song were good, it's too late to save this album 
 I had purchased for my 9 year old (who is a very advanced reader and gifted student) the Usborne World History book.  She LOVED that book, and has read it cover to cover several times. I figured that the Usborne Science Encyclopedia would be similarly interesting to her.  Wrong.  She has barely touched the Science Encyclopedia.  The problem with the Science Encyclopedia is that it is very complex and written at a very high level. I wouldn't recommend it for a child less than 14 or 15 and maybe even beyond that.   However, as I have skimmed the book, it seems very good, good illustrations, good content.  Just not for younger kids 
 This one didn't do it for me.  I really wanted to like this, being such a fan of the first film.  The acting in the film is okay, but it suffers so much compared to the Pacino/Penn film.  The climax was very bland.  The one thing I wish they would have explained better was how Carlito became friends with the Italian mobster and the African American bookie.  They were both very successful people in their own circles, and Carlito was just a common care thief.  Why would they cut him in as an equal partner in a tens of million dollar drug business?  Also, how did all three get in one cell.  This takes place in a time when racial tensions are high, and prison officials would not have put a white/African American and Hispanic in the same cell.  And while everyone else in the film hates each other for being differant, these three love each other.  I would have liked to see the story of how they got that way.  I would steer clear of this one 
   This is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet. I request you to do the needful. Thanking you Prince Georg 
 I have a lot of criticism of this album but I'll just mention what I feel is important.   I think the main reason I don't like the album is because George buries his voice underneath layers of orchestration on this album. Production wise, this album makes overproduced efforts like 'All things must pass' and even Ringo Starr's 'Ringo the fourth' look like 'Plastic Ono Band' by comparison. I don't think Overproduction is necessarily a bad thing, but you should be able to hear the vocalist easily. Perhaps Harrison was paying too much attention to his critics and the comments about his voice on the last album 'Dark Horse'. Not only that, his critically acclaimed masterpiece 'All things must pass' was a very riff driven album. The critically dissed 'Living in the material world' was not a riff driven album. So on Dark Horse and Extra Texture Harrison tries to make the songs more riff driven. However, I think sometimes he tends to be repetitous, but that's just my view.  I find most of the songs fairly enjoyable, and some of the songs show his knack for writing great melodies, but overall there are not the same kind of melodies displayed here as usual, in my opinion, and music is a matter of opinion. Going by other reviews, some people think it's great, some think it's bad and a few think it's a masterpiece. Try to hear sample before you buy.  In points of praise, I think 'You' is a terrific pop song. Other highlights for me were 'Grey Cloudy lies' where George experiments with synthesisers and that song has a very unique melody. 'Can't stop thinking about you' is a beautiful ballad that has the same kind of charm as the fadeout to 'Gave it all up'. This guitar can't keep from crying is alright, and they are the only songs I like personally 
 by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit Pollard's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might. And while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion, (i.e. swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century) Pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of Christian virtue. This is basically saying Christians have lost a culture war without explaining why.   While the initial exposition on what the parameters of Christian modesty mean Pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of Christian modesty would be. Furthermore, when push comes to shove he refers to the Westminster Larger Catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused. Some of his cases are self-defeating. On one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century.  Props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting.  On the other hand, it's cheap so if you're not persuaded the research has been effective it won't cost you much 
 If you don't understand Russian and going to follow subtitles - this one is for you. The DVD quality is perfect (I'm not gonna say anything about the movie - lots of reviews here). But the fact that amazon said it is Russian but it turned out to be Chezh made me sad. 
 these headphones were great at first, but then failed (right ear stopped working) after 3 months.  I sent the orginal pair back to the manufacturer for a replacement, but the replacement pair also failed with the same problem after a couple more months. Stay away from these 
 When will amazon allow a zero stars rating???? 
 This album appears to represent an obscure sub-segment of drum'n'bass. A stripped down, aural desert of only drums. They are skillful, original drums, but they have nothing to accompany. Aside from the distant echoeing atmospherics, all you get on this album is one long drum solo. This may be just right for a minute sub-segment of the d'n'b listening community, but for me it lacks 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 When I first picked up Drinking Coffee Elsewhere, I was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy.  And, truthfully, it's not a horrible book.  It is entertaining, the style works, etc.  On that note, if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking about it too much, then by all means, get it.  My problem with the book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of America, this is not your book.  Probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the African American female. Packer has very little new to say, and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by Alice Walker and other writers, but have also have been said better by those authors.  Drinking Coffee Elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of You Can't Keep a Good Woman Down, a book that, while having its own problems, would probably be a better use of your time and money if you're really interested in the social commentary in the text.  Even from the literary standpoint, it's not terribly outstanding.  The characters are stereotypes; the plots are predictable.  The adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person-- an intelligent outsider who struggles with race, religion, and fitting in-- and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so.  The other protagonists are the same, just not so irritable.  Similar to this lack of variation in her characters, Packer varies little in her narrative style.  Yes, the language is pretty at times, but there is no experimentation with language or structure; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice.  Finally, the stories themselves contain scenes that aren't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative.  In short, Drinking Coffee Elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books isn't actual talent, but how much your publisher backs you.  Packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs, which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out 
 I have read many cosmology books despite I am not a trained scientist or the like .. I found this book extreme boring and very frustrating to read and understand , It jumped from A to B and back to A with diagram which are hard to understand . The author is trying hard to convince the reader on his believe but lacks the tool to do so in a "friendly manner" .  I laboured through this book and in the end I found myself learned nothing .In fact I am hesitated to even pass this book to my friend to read  
 That anyone would mistake Greer's pseudo-philosophical rants for either an intelligent or thorough treatment of the subject is a testament to the pitiable state of Christian scholarship on the supposed "postmodern" turn in modern culture. Greer oversimplifies and misconstrues every complex philosophical term he touches, reading Derrida's "play of the trace" as a synonym for nihilism and spends a chapter "refuting" his views without ever providing evidence of having read (much less understood) him (no citations of Derrida's works are given).  If you are looking for a shallow, irresponsible treatment of the postmodern condition that restates evangelical fundamentalism with big fancy words, Mapping Postmodernism should be right up your alley. Those looking for an intelligent treatment of the subject, however, would be wise to find another map 
 I've read many fasting books and this one was very disappointing. Patricia Bragg offers many opinions non of which are based in the facts I was looking for. The best book I've read so far on fasting is: "Fasting and Eating for Health : A Medical Doctor's Program for Conquering Disease" by Joel Fuhrman and Neal D. Barnard, which offers many medical references 
 Unlike many people writing reviews of the product I haven't even been able to install the software as it doesn't support Windows Vista 
 I have to admire what Ms. Fisher was trying to do.  Just before this book was released a lot of women magazines ran short articles about the superiority of women that had some men sort of worried.  However, when the book was published the guys took a great sigh of relief.  Bascially, Ms. Fisher went about it all the wrong way and ended up writing a book that's really nothing more than a bunch of wishful thinking on her part. Fisher states a lot of things that had me saying "okay, that may be true, now back it up with the facts." If you're interesting in this sort of topic (and you should be!) check out Ashley Montagu's "The Natural Superiority of Women" it's out of print for some unknown reason, but you'll be able to find a copy somewhere. This guy really says it the way it is and and backs it up with proven facts. Amazing stuff when you realize that it was written by a guy.  
 Definitely not the best book that I've read but also not the worse.  It would have made an exceptional short story but the book contained to many areas that dragged.  The author has a smooth writing style and did a great job with character development.  Not a great book and not a total waste of time 
 I enjoy Jackie Chan's films but this was an exception.  It would have been fine to have cast this movie with just Jackie Chan and Fann Wong.  These two actors were great as a team.  Adding Owen Wilson to the mix was unnecessary and spoiled an otherwise excellent plot.  When he wasn't tedious, Wilson was boring.  Why was he even cast in this film?  This was a movie I won't be in a hurry to see again 
 Install and set up was a bit confusing. Had to contact tech. support (not real friendly or warm). We were looking to save time for data entry. We realized with much frustration typing was faster and more accurate. When scanning e-mail addresses the error rate was about 40% on a font size 6. Scanning 8 and above error rate went down to about 25%. Correcting the errors the pen made took more time then it was worth. The concept is great but does need  allot of improvement.  
 I was stuck without a book at the library a few days ago, and this was what I came up with.  I've read "Confessions" and "Shopaholic Ties the Knot" before, but really, this is too much.  Why would Luke Brandon love Becky?  She is constantly immature, sneaky, and deceitful, and I don't really get what goodness overcomes this.  I probably wouldn't be so frustrated except that I always have to finish a book once I start it, so I was stuck with it until the end 
 "This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world's greatest dictionary was singular, astonishing, memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad." - Prologue.  Well, that certainly could have been the story.  But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in "the history of the horse") with W.C. Minor's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so.  Winchester, the author of several other books I'll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book.  So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer's, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered.  Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go. 
 My kids and I read many of the same books. We're not disappointed very often, but with this one we were. The plot meanders, and the main character is quite uninteresting.  While there's a lot going on at times, it's not fun to follow and also because there was much repetition of the characters' not-too-insightful inner monologue. Often even my 10-year-old son would say "well, duh" to the character's thoughts. Perhaps they were meant to be dull and uninteresting? 
 I agree with most of the reviewers above who think this book is hogwash. As someone else noted, the book starts out strong but there is no payoff at the end.   As someone with Borderline Personality Disorder and a few other mental illnesses AND a Christian, I think this book is irresponsible. Peck says he thought "Jersey" might be a touch schizophrenic. A touch? You're either schizophrenic or your not. There is no in between. Someone might have psychotic tendencies; also, some who are bipolar can appear schizo but you think a psychiatrist like Peck would already know that.   In my opinion I don't think possession is real because I don't believe demons can cross over into this plane because if they could we'd all be possessed. Especially the extremely wicked. People have minds of their own and that's where the devil comes into play..in your MIND, not your body. 
 As I look over the reviews for Emergency!, I notice that only one agrees with me.  So, I'm writing my own review, just in case there's someone else who wonders if they're the only one who doesn't get it:  You are not alone...  Tony Williams is one of my favorite jazz drummers, but when I heard this album for the first time 15 or so years ago, I could not get past the sheer horridness of the recording quality.  I listened to it again not long ago, in a last ditch effort to see if I may have simply overreacted to the sound quality.  I did not overreact.  In fact, it sounded even worse than I remembered it.  The musicianship is fantastic - the band is truly made up of some of the greatest musicians of their day.  One of the other reviews here make mention of the "avant-garde" sound of it.  Personally, I have always equated the phrase "avant-garde" with the phrase "hot garbage," and unfortunately, no matter how much I want to appreciate Emergency! for it's musicality underneath the poor recording, I just can't seem to do it.  I give up.. 
 I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get "Born in Ice.&quot 
 I was pretty dissapointed in this set. Perhaps it's better suited for an engineer. I bought 507 Mechanisms at the same time and found it to be much easier to understand even though it was originally published over 100 years ago. I sent this set back b/c it just wasn't worth the money to me 
 I absolutely love this deck.  I bought this along with "Zombie Madness" and the "Warrior's Triumph" structure decks.  They all rock,  but this is my favorite.  And for the guy who gave the Winged Dragon Of Ra tip, on the bottom of the card it says "THIS CARD CANNOT BE USED IN A DUEL". So even if you happen to get one [which costs a LOT] you can't officially use it. Overall,  this deck is very cool.  I love Red Eyes Darkness dragon!    P.S. For best results,  buy the Yu-Gi-Oh! deluxe pack for 20$.  It comes with "Dragon's Roar" and "Zombie Madness" plus two rare cards ["Rope Of Life" and "Armed Dragon LV7"]. Here's what they do:   Rope Of Life  PGD-105-Ultra Rare Trap Card: This card can only be activated by discarding your entire hand when 1 of your own monsters is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle. Special Summon the monster just sent to the Graveyard in face-up Attack or Defense Position, and increase its ATK by 800 points.  "Armed Dragon LV7"   This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. This card cannot be Special Summoned except by the effect of "Armed Dragon LV5". Send 1 monster card from your hand to the Graveyard to destroy all face-up monsters on your opponent's side of the field with an ATK equal to or less than the ATK of the sent monster.    Add this the deck for an amazing combo!  Start off by setting a Masked Dragon card in defense mode.  When your opponent destroys it,  use its effect to summon "Armed Dragon LV3".  During your Standby Phase,  Send it to the graveyard to Special Summon "Armed Dragon LV5".  Then use it to attack your opponent's monster which is most likely destroyed.  Then when you end your turn use its effect to special summon "Armed Dragon LV7" from your hand OR deck!  You now have a 2800 atk points on the field!  Sweet!  And its effect is soooooooooo cool. I put the "Rope Of Life" card in my "Warrior's Triumph" structure deck.  It helps out a lot! I hope you will make the right choice in buting this deck or the more preferable deluxe pack.  Yu-Gi-Oh! Your Move 
 When I started reading this book, I was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice.  Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny.  On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written, and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that I expected.  We've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix "challenged" that it just isn't funny anymore.  I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since 
 The author reviews mathematical history but mentions no India nor China. He presented a biased view of mathematical history. The books is misleading in that regard 
 Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?  Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...  Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO 
 I was dreaming to see this movie for a long time, since 1997. And finally I bought it in Europe for 10 Euro. So what did I find there? Nothing, there is lack of everything. Anyone can shoot something like this, adding clowns in movie does not make it masterpiece. It is not that I do not like David Lynch's movies but here Mr. Lynch and some other people simply wanted to make money. One of the worsest movies ever seen 
 Don't buy this dvd. While the exercises are good, the dvd has been poorly planned. When you access the menu, you have the choice of going into the yoga or baby massage section. When you go into the yoga section, it automatically launches the introduction & preamble. Every single time. And it is not short-perhaps five minutes long.   Apparently developed by a mother. But, what kind of child does she have? When the babies are asleep, every personal minute counts. We don't have time to watch an intro every single time. And if the babies are with us while we do the same the dvd, same problem. The only question is who will get bored first, the mother or the baby 
 I know exactly what another reader means here, but it seems to be the norm of using the same words for the relaxion, but throwing in a few words for whatever the title of the CD claims to be. It doesn't do guided imagery justice, which works very well with some other authors 
 The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.  His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as "department store") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive 
 This is a cheap made in asia transfer to DVD, certainly not worth the price. Advertised subtittles are not included.  I wonder if MGM is aware of that release and if their copyrights were properly protected. I would suggest that Amazon take this item off their catalog. Conclusion: don't get fooled, don't buy! 
 I purchased the Kensington Accessory Adapter to connect my iPod Shuffle to my Bose Sounddock while at work.  Used in this application, the adapter creates an annoying "hiss." Playing at a louder volume can drown out the hiss, but it's always there in the background.  Bad unit or just unsuitable in this application 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 Our church book study group mistakenly purchased this Bad Girls of the Bible instead of the one by the other author.  While I had great difficulty getting through the first chapter, I am now using this book to improve my understanding of the Bible, and to learn more about ancient times.    This writer makes-up her own story lines, and conveniently leaves out portions of chapters and verses that do not fit her story line.  For example, in chapter two, she states that Egypt where Joseph is held as a slave by Potiphar, is a dry hot land.  Perhaps she should read just a little earlier in the Bible. In Genesis 13:10, we are told different. 10 Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar.  While the ordering of this book was a mistake on the part of the person who ordered the books for us, I believe it is a Godsend for us to read and discuss this book, though I doubt we will actually be using the questions at the end of each chapter.  Instead we will ask questions regarding her inaccurate portrayal of these women and the facts of history. 
 I found any plot disrupted by the author's silly use of the term "mon". I believe he used it to give us an insight into Jamaican culture :=). Sam Tucker's use of the words "Boy" and "Son" are also very amateurish 
 If you are looking for insight on how to build your business, this is not the right book.  It may be useful for young people or emerging artists.  Many of the tips are related to life skills.  The tips are presented simplisticly.  They are not particularly helpful for artists already in the marketplace.  
 The Edith Wharton novel this movie was made from was beautifully written, sensitive and poetic. While this movie was visually appealing and faithfully rendered the story, the performances of Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz were painful to watch. Ms. Anderson especially, while a great beauty, so overdid her lines that I was reminded of high-school plays that I've seen. For emotion or drama, she spoke moreloudly. Her lines were raced through, and punctuated by strange words being stressed. And while she was trying to be distraught, or betrayed, or vulnerable, her face showed no emotion at all. A little bit of eye-brow raised, or pouting lips, but that was all. Eric Stoltz was little better. I couldn't help feel that Ms. Anderson was out of her depth as an actress. Bur Mr. Stoltz, who I've seen in many good roles, was inexplicable. Maybe it was the directing that failed them.  This was so disappointing to me, as I had really wanted to enjoy it, and I had so enjoyed "The Age of Innocence," with Winona Ryder, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daniel Day-Lewis. But this production, from a superior book, really fell short. I would recommend the PBS version, with Geraldine Chaplin, if it were in any way available 
 I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice 
 I can't know why this band is so popular as they are so BORING!!!!!! They've only made a single listenable song in "Highway to Hell". Rest of that, they suck!!!! For Those About to Rock is really awful, don't purchase this junk...get Brothers In Arms from Dire Straits insted. That rocks, not this!!!!!!!! 
 I rented the CD book from the library. I do not write long reviews but instead like to point out the major flaws or good points.  The storyline is OK. However the sheer banality of the diaglogue is almost staggering. The average emotional and mental IQ of the characters is extremely low. These people are not interesting!!!!!!! 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 Alistair in outer space is about a little boy who is really smart and does everything right. One day Alistair was going to return his library books but when he got to the library he was abducted by aliens who call themselves Goots. The Goots wanted to take them to there home planet Gootula, But Alistair did not want to go because he had to return the library books in time. I'm not going to tell you what happens at the end so you'll have to read it for your self. This is not a very good book for little kids because it does not really teach them anythin 
 That should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high-profile cast & normally respectable director are put to.  Another possible title is "It's All About the Groceries", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.  It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  "Kiss the Girls" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.  This movie is worth the price of a rental, but I'd take a pass on purchasing it.  For a better treatment of female-cop-with-dark-secrets-and-Issues, & a stronger movie all-around, I recommend "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock 
 After I read this book, I was siezed by an uncontrollable desire to pave my front yard 
 The play was relatively entertaining and has a promising beginning, but Higgins' infuriating and incesant bullying doesn't change, and quickly becomes tiresome. You keep expecting the characters to evolve, to grow into something better, or at least different, and none of them really do. Doolittle is still lazy, Pickering always the gentlemen, and most frustratingly, Eliza and Henry are never truly able to understand one another. In the beginning I was an immediate fan, but as the story continued I grew more and more dissatisfied, and by the end I felt that it was a complete waste of time 
 Harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals, and her bright friend's big plan is to set off a smoke bomb (incendiary) during a school assembly. Either one will get a kid expelled, arrested, and in the newspapers. Not amusing ! Then there's Golly telling her about the virtues of lying. If there is a lesson that could be drawn (which the movie misses), Harriet's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing, because she is showing the sort of behavior that (in a kid 2 years older) would be take as a possible symptoms for other bad things like self-mutilation or bulemia, as in the movie "Thirteen. 
 Read Quigleys Tragedy and Hope.  Its a much more important book(especially the 2nd 600 pgs) and a better read too.  After reading it you will feel as though you were just pulled out of the Matrix.. 
 Has Danieele Steel been abducted by aliens or has she been "Kloned" and this insane Klone wrote this book.  I actually thought about not finishing this book but I thought there might be a logical ending...Beyond disappointing.  Her characters have no substance, I don't want to meet the person who could relate to these whimpy weirdos.  This might be the worst book I've ever read. I just read this book, quite quickly in one afternoon. I think I've pretty much purchased and read every Danielle Steel book she's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads. I understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory. There is never much suprise as to how a DS book will end, the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns, historical and geographical research she puts into her books. This book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books. Definately not worth the hardcover price, the paperback price or even the used price. Time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity 
 Be warned. The Office Project program advertised as included is a trial version. The ad does not say this. Now I have to turn around a buy a new program- Amazon customer service says it isn't their fault. I really needed the book and the program for a class due to start in four days. Now I'm really stuck. Amazon is even trying to get me to pay for the return shipping 
 "I was flushing the evil out....It was a good feeling knowing even though I might not be able to sleep, at least I'd feel clean."   17 year old Brendan and his friends Will and Kevin are the dregs of school society, the outcast, the fringe. Now they're in for a night of memories. After throwning back some Acid, they've hit the streets of Philly to enjoy themselves when the Pure Sunshine kicks in. The best and worst part about Sunshine is it makes everything else boring. It takes Brendan past all the normal experiences to where he can't enjoy anything anymore because of his desire for the next hit.   That's where Sunshine leaves him---at a place where the real and surreal mix together and separate in a way that leaves real life not worth as much as induced life. In the middle of a midnight trip, Brendan and the guys visit Sally, the downtown girl, so they can relax safely and enjoy their high. With so many girls that Brendan wishes he could take things deeper with, their night with Sally awakens a spark in him for something more. Not necessarily with Sally. Or any specific girl. But with something. For once, he feels his void.   Brian James' PURE SUNSHINE delves into the euphoria and pain people experience when addicted to LSD. While the details of the high can be intriguing at times, a sense of arc and story are strangely missing all the way through. The story is more a realization that drugs may not be everything Brendan's made them out to be. Thatâ(tm)s the only thing that can bring him back to the point he can enjoy reality again, give him a chance with the girl he's always wanted, and get him to a place he can feel clean for the first time in a long time.

  this  book for the price could have been done in a smaller format  at a much less expensive  price.  i like  woods work alot but these really  are just a bunch  very minimal drawings streched out to make a hearty meal, no can do. it misses the mark big time. spend your bucks and buy process recess by james jean .  that came today and woww!!! 
 Honestly, I like Tony Brown. I enjoyed his PBS show. I listen to him on the radio when I can (WLS in Chicago). But, his books are not nearly as good as I know they can be!  This book deals with his "Mama", a woman who took him in when he was a baby and his mother was neglecting him. She was not a blood relative, just a woman who saw a baby starving to death due to neglect. He lived with her until her death when he was 12. This book is an attempt on his part to honor her and the simple wisdom she taught him. The Seven Core Values are:  1. Reality: The Value of Being Yourself. 2. Knowledge: The Value of understanding your purpose 3. Race: The Value of honoring your humanity (In this case, the only race his Mama was worried about was worried about was the human race) 4. History: The value of investing in the future 5. Truth: the value of being true to yourself 6. Patience: the value of "Keeping the faith" 7. Love: the value of living joyfully.  As in his other book, Brown repeats himself a lot. He quotes a passage from Hamlet 3 times (part of the "to thine ownself be true" speech) as part of his multiple descriptions of his high school English teacher. He lifts two pages from his other book concerning a story about a YMCA opening in his hometown. He says the same thing, over and over, repitiously, a lot. He repeats himself. Yes, indeed, he seems to say something and then say it again. Repititive, he is.  Like his last book ('Black Lies, White Lies), this book is in serious need of an editor. He seems to have written the chapters seperately, without regard to what he had previously written. I like the sentiments and ideas expressed, but, man, it was sometimes tiring to read them.  
 I was excited about this cd...then I started listening to it. If I wanted Beastie Boys I would have bought Beastie Boys. Its nothing but lame 80's rap loops and a few butt rock tracks. Nothing like the Bloodhound gang of old. What happened to the techno/pop? What happened to somewhat punk? The only good song on the cd is Kids incorporated. I would consider this their joke cd since about half of the tracks are garbage and only 40 seconds long. One word...lame 
 I can't believe I wasted as much time as I did on this book.  This is perhaps one of the worst slap-together-a-story jobs in recent publication.  I was looking for a slice of NY life, and what I got was no Big Apple--just a rotten apple.  Does anyone want to buy my copy (only about 3/4 read and slightly vomit stained) 
 I agree with the other reviewer in seeing this book as a very poor translation of Zen stories. I doubt that any Zen story's opening line should be translated as "Once upon a time there was a...". I also very much doubt that a Japanese woman would insult an old man like this, "What do you know, baldy?". However, it does not seem as though this is just an attempt to make the stories understandable to a Western sensibility. Thomas Cleary does not seem to have any feel for the deeper meanings in these Zen stories and many of his translations are simply dull and flatly state the obviousness. 
  		If euphoria is the result of unwarranted optimism based on substantial previous achievement, then Galbraith was sadly carried away by the euphoria of his own reputation in attempting this topic.  	Many of his books are beacons of astute political, economic and social judgment;  one of his finest, rarely if ever matched by any author, is 'The Scotch'.  This book is more of a Cliff's Notes compilation of financial accidents, concluding with the wise advice to "Be Careful".  	To take one example, he doesn't explain the WHY of Tulipomaniaof the 1630s.  He merely concludes, "Anyone who has seen the tulip fields of this calm and pleasat land in the spring retains forever a feeling that the Tulipomania did foretell nature's true grace."  Time and again he walks away from poignant examples with the obvious conclusion that sometimes something nice happens.  	Financial euphoria, from what I've seen, is very much like the mania for hula hoops, basketball hoops and Beanie Babies and a Google stock IPO.  The madness of crowds for new fads is a result of honest and optimistic people who want to share in a good thing.  This is the basis of a prosperous society, even if it can lead to occasional financial euphoria.  	Sadly, he mixes the madness of Tulipomania with the outright fraud of crooks who deliberately create a climate of excited optimism to defraud honest people.  Fraud is a circus salesmen who offers "a special opportunity" to "See the Egress" for only a small fee.  There's a big difference between honest promoters and cynical crooks.  It makes me suspect Galbraith was never a salesman, and resolutely ignored the circus if it ever ventured near Harvard.  	Galbraith ignores the vast difference between the two.  One is the enthusiastic optimism of a promoter with a new idea who takes great risks to make it a reality;  an example is Thomas Edison and his thousands of attempts to develop ideas into useful products.  The second is the enthusiastic illusions of a trickster whose only goal is to separate the honest but optimistic people from their money;  an example is Robert Vesco.  	In the first case, an optimistic society with confidence in a better future can become the victim of the irrational exuberance of its expectations.  This phenomena truly needs to be studied to understand irrational financial euphoria.  The second is the crook who uses clever words instead of a big club to steal from anyone and everyone.  	Galbraith failed to distinguish between the two or to explain the nature of either.  It makes his book more of a short example of overconfidence in his own ability to be cogent, concise and relevant.    
 This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment.  I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed.  This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very "hush-hush" back in the early 90s.  Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today).  This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film.  This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship.  I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich for me.  It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.  The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film.  This was an art film, so what am I griping about?  I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic.  I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder.  I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clichs that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard.  It was unimpressive.  It wasn't bold filmmaking, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story.  Was it to be educational?  I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line.  The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind.  This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland.  The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved.  Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party.  There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.  That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex.  There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening.  This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight.  I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway.  From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex.  They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day.  It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant.  There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run.  This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships.  I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently.  There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film.  Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route.  The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive "honey pot".  It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.  Overall, I was not impressed.  There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive "raw" sensation by trying to shock the audiences.  One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society.  If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style, I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth.  Instead, I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game "Go Fish".  Ha ha ha h....it just isn't working for me.  I do not recommend this film in the least bit.  There was one, singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I cannot remember why.  It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema.  Skip it.  Grade: * out of **** 
 I felt a little ripped off, when I got volume 1 and 2 together as an offer from Amazon.Com. Movie wise, volume 2 is actually exactly the same as volume 1, with volume 2 having the option for japanese dialog and Eng subtitle. Amazon could have at least indicated that in the "description" 
 It's bad enough that this doesn't even attempt to be compatible with the Mac, but we can't get it to work with our PC, either. There are NO instructions for getting it to work in the owner's manual and no help online either. It's nice and small, and records well, but no good to me if the file can't be put onto the computer. 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 I never read Madeline books as a child and was captivated by them when I started reading them to my child.  I was very excited to make this book a part of my holiday book collection. However I should have read this one before buying!This one makes no sense, its hardly about Christmas at all and the usual charming rhymes are not there. Check this one out at the library before buying 
 I think this quote from a review sums this up the best - "As we all know, we have the power to rule ourselves. This being said, what are we waiting for?"  If this were in a book from the world, I would expect a statement like that, but from a professing Christian?  I had control of my life for years and it progressively drove me further and further away from God.  Having control of our own life is the PROBLEM, not the solution.  The solution lies in surrendering control of our lives to the God who created us, not continuing in rebellion against Him.  When I was the ruler of my own life, it led to me breaking every single one of his moral codes that He gave to mankind.  Just look at them (the ten commandments) -   1. I thought I was fine with this one - I didn't believe in Allah or Zeus or any other gods. Of course, I was still nowhere near keeping this one ("don't have any other Gods before me") - there were plenty of other things I put in my life before God. I'd rather sleep in than go to church. I'd rather watch tv than read the Bible, etc.   2. I thought I was fine with this one because I didn't make any silly carved gods or idols. But I still made a god in my image. Every time I would say "why would God..." or "my God wouldn't..." or "I don't think God would...." I was making up a god in my image. Coincidentally enough, it was always happy with the things I was doing, but He was going to get all those other "bad" people. (Also, if you agree with Dr. Schuller that the key to knowing God is self-love and a positive attitude, you're guiltly of breaking this one also)  3. OK, I knew I was guilty of taking the Lord's name in vain and using it as a profanity, which was bad enough, but I was even worse than that. I was calling myself a Christian, yet I lived with my wife for years before getting married, never attended church or even had any idea what the Bible said and basically just living a competely ungodly lifestyle. While using God as a profanity is violating this commandment, what I was doing was taking the Lord's name (i.e. calling myself a CHRISTian) in vain in an even worse sense.   4. I would also admit I was guilty of this one. No matter how you want to interpret the sabbath law, I wasn't putting aside any days for God, they were all for me.   5. Honor your father and mother? Not even close. 'Nuff said.   6. Don't murder? Good, I'm fine on that one - oh wait, Jesus said that whoever hates anyone is a murderer. Got me on that one too.   7. No adultery? I was fine on this one too, I never cheated on my wife. Of course, as I already mentioned, I lived with her for years before we got married. I didn't see this as wrong because I had no idea whatsoever of the seriousness of this in God's eyes. Under God's law the penalty for adultery or any sexual sin was the same as murder. In the New Testament, it is clear that even professing Christians who don't honor their marriage commitments are only fooling themselves. That's because marriage isn't about us. Sure it's a wonderful, beautiful thing for us, but more importantly it was designed as an earthly expression of God's love for His people. Corrupting that gives a distorted picture of who God is which is why it is so badly under attack today, even from professing Christians. Some people think that if you're a Christian, you have to stop liking sex. Not true at all, I love sex. The Bible has a whole book in it about sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7 saying "not tonight dear, I have a headache" is a sin (and just before the guys get too excited about that one, it says that our bodies don't belong to ourselves, but to our spouses, and while the concept is obviously sexual, I think that if your wife wants to use your body to take out the garbage or do the dishes, that qualifies too). But God designed it and it needs to be done his way (and of course I disagreed with this, which took me back to the second commandment). But even more so - I was really in trouble with this one because Jesus said that whoever looks at a woman with lust has already commited adultery. Well, I was in trouble there.   8. Don't steal anything? Well, I never stole anything big so I was fine. Doesn't matter, even when I stole toilet paper from the buildings on campus so that we wouldn't have to buy any for our apartment in college, that's still stealing.   9. Don't lie. See my comments on honor your father and mother (which is actually kind of ironic, since when I tried to proclaim my honesty, sometimes I'd say "well, I lie to my parents sometimes, but that's ok.")   10. Don't covet. See those same comments again. Don't want something that doesn't belong to you - if I told you that I've always kept this commandment, you'd probably die laughing and you don't even know me.   But God's a loving God?  (these quotations are all from the New Testament and written TO CHRISTIANS)  "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God." (1 Cor 6:9-10)  "For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not be partakers with them." (Eph 5:5-7)  "Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God." (Gal 5:19-21)  The reason Dr. Schuller's television show and books are so popular is because people want to feel good about themselves while continuing in their sins and yet still feel that somehow they'll still get to go to heaven when they die.  But there's one problem with this - why did Jesus have to die?  Dr. Schuller's gospel has no answer for this question.  But the Bible does.  The Bible looks at the sins that you and I have committed (and after reading that list, if you can honestly say that you have not sinned.... well, I have no answer for that other than to pray for you) and say that we deserve hell.  Hell is a real place (not just low self-esteem or any kind of hell on earth that we can imagine) full of pain and torture.  It's what we deserve, but God loves us and doesn't want us to go there.  So He took all those sins that you and I have committed and paid the price for them Himself.  He took the penalty for our transgressions so that we don't have to.  That's the true Gospel, and you can accept that forgiveness.  All you need to do is stop believing in a self-love gospel and recognize sin for what it is - sin.  Then turn from those sins and put your full trust in Jesus.  Stop reading these books and start reading God's Word - the Holy Bible.  He will not let you down.  You will move from death to life, your final destination will change from hell to heaven.  Please at least take the time to look into what I'm saying.  Right now there's a million and one things I'd rather be doing (and some I should be doing) than typing a review for something I completely disagree with, but I'm doing this for the exact reason that I mentioned above - HELL IS REAL WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT!  God doesn't want you to go there (just look at all the agony He suffered so you wouldn't have to) and I don't want you to either.

 It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book.   I do not know what slowed me down more, the disjointed writing or the plot that seamed to just be thrown together.   I only made it about half way into the book.   I thought there was going to be a mystery here somewhere - maybe that is the mystery.  I got to think after awhile that the author was leaving out about every third sentence, it just made that little sense.   There are many better books out there 
 This movie could've been something, had they gotten some real actors, a script and a director. Well, they didn't, and this movie is an embarassment to mankind 
 I would NOT recommend new writers to read this UNTIL they have finished writing their book.  While it has great advice on the publishing business, it practically discourages any one from writing at all.  It's very "left-winged" and biased.  If you don't live in New York, forget it.  The book makes you feel like you don't have any chance of ever getting published!!  Not good reference material for first time writers

 Concerning the author's evaluation of creation science / creationism / intelligent design, he, attempts or thinks his sarcasm about laws requiring more than just evolution to be taught, qualifies as evidence. In other words saying things like,  "Didya catch that little part, see they don't actually mention God, but oooo they are sneaky, they just talk about 'intellegint design', (but really oh so devious, it's christians trying to convert you)."  Read the book and tell me I am wrong. He gives no evidence that the laws requiring open RATHER THAN A ONE SIDED LESSON is wrong, or unscientific. Furthermore he implies there is only one type of science and that only one definition can exist. Science at it's basic definition means A METHOD OF MEASURMENT. There isn't only a "secular non-religious science" or "science that can't be used to give evidence that God exists". Why didn't he bother to look that word up in the dictionary? Hate + quick $ is why.  Furthermore he ridiculously claims that teachers shouldn't be pressured to teach... lol. So PRESSURE is an evil thing? Hey, people of the world, I challenge any of you to explain logically, why to teach something under compulsion is wrong IN AND OF ITSELF. Here, can anyone deny this, if a teacher is compelled to teach EVOLUTION, does that mean evolution shouldn't be taught merely because the teacher was compelled to teach it lol? Not only that, the author argues that merely FEELING compelled to teach means the teacher is teaching wrongly.  Not only that, the author is contradicting his stance that there is either no God or moral absolutes (which if there were would mean there was a God). Why? BECAUSE THE AUTHOR IS ARGUING ABOUT THE MORALITY OF WHAT GEORGE BUSH IS DOING AND TEACHERS BEING COMPELLED TO TEACH. Why argue for one absolute morality over another? Is the author's version magically superior? Is he God? Why should his way be pushed on everyone?  Why is the author against FREE SPEECH in the class room? Why SHOULDN'T INTELLIGENT DESIGN be mentioned? Does motive whether it be anti-God motives in Darwinism or pro-God in intelligent design mean neither should be mentioned because of what the person is thinking? The author argues against thought-policing by George Bush yet he is playing thought police with intelligent design.  The book is a typical contradictory hodge podge which tries to spin off insults and sarcasm as evidence in and of itself rather than hard facts.  Note, I am not endorsing George Bush with this review, rather, pointing out the author's contradictory arguing.  
 The author, in his introduction, describes this as an attempt to create a text for college and graduate level literature and conducting courses. Unfortunately, it is to thin, inconsistent and dated to be of use for any college course. Most information is covered too briefly to be of much help and is at times inconsistent with scholarship that was current when this book was published. Though the reference lists contain a large and balanced list of sources, the ones cited in the text are almost entirely ones from the 1960's and before.  The best use for the text would be by non-college trained choral conductors and possible a freshman introductory course 
 This book gets to the heart of what really constitutes a book review.  Does a book get X stars because it is grammatically correct?  Because the reader happened to like the subject matter?  Because the author is adept at using descriptive adjectives?  I don't really have an answer to that general question, so let me just say I gave the book a low rating because of the effect it had on me.   Frances Mayes obviously knows how to write well technically.  Nobody needs me to tell him that.  The problem for me was the way the author conveyed her choice of subject material.  She soon began to sound quite self-indulgent and self-absorbed with this "pert orange rind", that "meandering back road", this "raised fork" and that "riotous bougainvillea".  It felt eventually like I was reading about someone  partaking of a huge buffet of the senses.  Interesting for a short time, but for over 400 pages?  The book became numbing and repetetive.  Perhaps this is the result of patching together the various vacations she took over the 5-year period and using the same formula to convey the impressions of each one consecutively.  I would have enjoyed the book if it had been about 250 pages shorter and had concentrated on just one geographical location.  And if there had been more of the "location" described, and less of Frances Mayes' perceptions of it.  It really seemed as if she was writing for an audience of one; herself.           
 I loved the first two Sirenia albums for their diversity.  Screams, growls, whispers, clean vocals, female vocals, choirs, you name it - it was there.  Now the songs are less complex, more repetitious, and (gasp) "radio-friendly" with pop-style female vocals and Morten's vocals appearing on only three songs.    Ouch!  Not exactly what we long-time fans were expecting!!  If the goal was to become a more accessible, female fronted band...then I suppose Morten succeeded.  However this is not going to thrill everyone who has been listening since Tristania.  Speaking of them, Illumination was surprisingly more creative than this album.  I hope Sirenia goes back to its old, diverse and exciting ways.  The first two albums were in my stereo for a consistent six months or longer.  I haven't even been able to listen to this one even six times.  A "Downfall" for now...but perhaps if enough of us speak out, we'll get a stronger fourth album.  (fingers crossed) 
 Not only is their later music much better, I take real issue with the lyrics to "Mohammad Is Jesus"; they don't conform to reality 
 This book's sub-title says, "How Great Traders Make Money in Up or Down Markets."  The content of this book falls far from delivering its promise.  The cover of this book promises that it will show you how to apply trend following techniques to your trading. "Covel walks you through the process, one step at a time, in plain English." He certainly does no such thing.  If you are looking for a trend-following system, you will not find it in this book; nor will you find any help or guidance in how to go about developing your own trend following system.  As someone who trades for a living, I found nothing between the covers of this book applicable to improving real-world trading results. 
 wow...i look at this track listing and it makes me cringe....i mean i know that warped lost its punk credibility back in 2003, but this is just overkill....relient k, academy is, everytime i die, from first to last, underoath, matchbook romance, saves the day are reasons not to support this tour(for all those people who go just to see NOFX, Casualties, and Time Again)...i REALLY give bad religion and rancid props for not being on here this time around! this is worse than last year's by far....but what could you expect? these tours over the past 3 years have been on a downfall...i mean the bands that are good on this aren't really worth the agony and disgust to want to purchase this and/or purchase a 40$ ticket to one of the shows. to me, that is a scam...im so glad that people stopped referring to warped tour as a "punk" tour...i mean maybe if NOFX gets a hefty amount of boos from those trendy scenester hot topic kids, then maybe even those guys can see what hell this "nu-emo" trend is.  now, i am not going to go off on some explosion about what real punk is, but i will say this....fans of warped 2003 and back...steer clear..this is merely a compilation of green day-esque bands(minus Time Again and Casualties..and maybe 3-5 other decnet bands)....some are turned up a few thousand jolts and some are slowed down a little bit, but i bet any of them will admit that bille joe(brainless) armstrong is a deep inspiring figure.  all we are really missing here to make this the ultimae pile of crap is fallout boy, simple plan, yellowcard, blink 182, good charlotte and new-school afi.  bottom line...avoid like the plague and maybe it will change next year for the better!......most likely it'll be worse, but hey, stranger things have happened 
 Didn't music listeners get enough after "White Tee". When white tee came out i thought it was a fairly descent beat and catchy lyrics. But with this cd, dem franchise boyz just proved that they are only capable of coming out with one original song, "Lean wit it, rock wit it" has all the junior high white boys chanting the lyrics while they shuffle through ipods their mama's bought for them, this just tells you that these guys don't kno how to dish out good rap. "Lean wit it, rock wit it" is getting so much credit on the radio but has ne one else noticed that the exact beat and lyrical flow was used for White Tee?, damnit, all the other songs are garbage and seem like theyre just filler for that one song. This just shows that nowadays "Nobodies" are coming out of nowhere and dominating charts because theyre just out to get the paper..they have no real talent, and the kids are eating up this garbage,,,real talent goes to groups like Crucial Conflict, Three 6 Mafia, 8Ball & MJG, Bone Thugs N Harmony, Do or Die, Wu Tang Clan, and artists like T.I., Jay-Z, Lil' Wayne, the Game, Mobb Deep, and Twist 
 After you have read a few of Coulter's romanic fiction novels, they become the very same story over and over again.  However, her contemporary mystery plots remain very good 
 This book is a big waste of time and money just like many other Maya books. I have bought and read over 5 Maya books geared towards begginers and none of them including this one is helpful. They have many great tutorials, but all the directions are very hard to understand because they leave alot of missing information out. Its like they expect you to really know the software in and out to study their beginner books series.  My advice for begginners is to use a less demanding program. Many people who use Maya are pros and thats not to say you won't be either. But unless you go to school, these books in my opionion are worthless. Even though the tutorials are made by people who have big names in the CGI industry, doesn't mean they have the teaching skills to get us small people going.  I recommend Lightwave, because the book, Inside Lightwave 8 taught me in a breeze how to ge up and running fast 
 It's sad that when a point of view or politcal party becomes more important than reality.  This book is just conjecture and wishful thinking.  Nothing more than bait and switch pulp.  It's too bad politcal thought and discourse have devolved in to nothing more than picking a team.  Our country deserves better.  Good work Podhoretz! Satan has seen your work and he likes what he sees!  You'll have plenty of time go over it with him when you burn in Hell for eternity.  Hey Christians, thou shalt not bear false witness counts for you, too!  Who says the lunatic fringe are the only one's who can pass judgement 
 He is the winnner of the latest Survivor & is in this movie.  It is barely watchable, only view it if you are a die hard fan 
 This is one of Davies two or three most noted books but certainly not one of his best. You'll get a better discussion of quantum theory in his volumes 'Superforce', 'The Matter Myth' or 'About Time' and a better treatment of philosophical and theological considerations in his award-winning 'The Mind of God'. Davies is one of this reader's favorite science writers, but I'll not recommend this volume. Your time will be better spent reading any of the four books that I mentioned above. Developments of the past twenty years have countered some of the cosmology presented here, but this is nothing to hold against the author, it is what happens in science. Rather worse is Davies' understanding of theology, it is strangely uninformed for someone with his apparent interest in the discipline. On several points he is dealing with mere straw men. One of several problems is Davies treatment of theology's famous 'cosmological argument' which has been variously employed by such thinkers as Aristotle, Leibniz, and Swinburne. In this discussion (third chapter) he appears to accept that Bertrand Russell had succeeded in defeating the general argument through the introduction of his famous "sets of sets" paradox. The argument is this: if the cause-effect relationships within the temporal universe are taken as sets of relationships, then the universe as a whole is the set of these sets. Russell then demonstrated, using the 'library books / catalogs of library books' paradox, that the universe itself need not be subject to the rules of causal relationships that apply within the universe. The reason, Russell argued, that causal relationships should not be applied to the universe (as a set of sets) is that causal relationships within the universe (space/time) must have an aspect of temporal sequence, and that since there can be no temporal quality such as "before" "before" time itself, the universe need not be caused. That there is no sequence outside of time is hardly arguable. But when Davies goes on to say that we must think in terms of "beyond, not before" the universe, he demonstrates that the supposed problem is simply one of reckless semantics. After all, just as 'before' is a temporal concept, 'beyond' is a spatial concept; perhaps there cannot be a "beyond" the universe either? Davies would (rightly) respond that "beyond" does not necessarily involve a spatial quality, for example we might speak of a concept or understanding being "beyond me." And as Davies later explains, in his consideration of 'mind', ideas (say, the calculus or a Beethoven symphony) do not, in essence, exist spatially (or temporally, the piece of music does not cease to exist when the orchestra finishes), yet certainly do exist "beyond" the concert hall or the notations on paper. Similarly, of the "super-existent Being," the theologian says, "Cause of all existence, and therefore itself transcending existence" (to cite ancient language), causes space-time from "beyond" [or conceptually "above"] space-time, not from temporally "before" it. As Davies concedes, theologians (notably Augustine) discerned this many centuries before Russell attempted to colonize causal language. There are several definitions that logicians have assigned to the concept of causality; Aristotle's most straightforward definition is simply "explanatory factor." Russell's argument based on a temporal baseline presents no clear paradox for a supra-cosmic Mind; most philosophers have rightly rejected his demand that we restrict explanation to his preferred language, and it is unclear why Davies was so uncritical on this point. Concluding this discussion, Davies says that we can imagine an uncaused universe -- or even a steady-state universe (although the idea fares poorly against observation) -- but eventually concedes that we cannot finally explain such things in any scientific or otherwise rational way: ". . . Swinburne writes: It would be an error to suppose that if the universe is infinitely old, and each state of the universe at each instant of time has a complete explanation in terms of a previous state . . . (and so God is not invoked), that the existence of the universe throughout infinite time has a complete explanation, or even a full explanation. It has not. It has neither. It is totally inexplicable." Davies later revisits causality from the perspective of quantum uncertainty and the superposition problem. He treats this material better elsewhere. In many ways, Polkinghorne's 'The Quantum World' (written at about the same time) treats this subject better than any I have seen. The ideas in Davies' chapter on Time are treated more extensively in his later volume 'About Time.' On points Davies strays completely from physics while failing to penetrate philosophy very deeply. A straw characterization of theology's understanding of 'omnipotence' is presented in the consideration of free will versus determinism (chapter 10). Davies cites Hume's argument that God either wills evil (and is therefore not omnibenevolent) or is incapable of eliminating evil (and therefore not omnipotent). Again, the author uncritically accepts Hume's argument, apparently ignorant of the theological response (Hume's argument was not new and some counter arguments had been given two millennia earlier). Davies says, "the power of an omnipotent God is without limit, and such a being is free to have whatever he chooses." Actually the statement cannot be true, omnipotence is logically self-limiting in a way that omnipresence or omniscience, is not. For example, an omnipotent Being cannot be free to terminate his omnipotent self, for if he is "free to have whatever he chooses," in choosing cessation he could neither "have" nor "choose." Logical limits seem inherent to omnipotence, limits imposed by mutual exclusion. Again, consider the question: "is God powerful enough to make a rock so heavy that he is not powerful enough to lift it?" The question is supposed to demand a glitch in God's omnipotence. Ignoring that since Newtonian relativistic physics (let alone its advance via Einsteinian fields), the picture being painted is physically nonsensical, it is also logical nonsense. Further, an omnipotent being is not free to simultaneously provide and deny freedom any more that he could create a three dimensional spherical (1 surface) cube (6 surfaces), because of logical mutual exclusion. Strangely, after arguing otherwise earlier, Davies reaches such a conclusion in chapter 17. For a technical theological consideration of omnipotence and the existence of evil, one should seriously engage so-called 'possible worlds' theory; for a less technical approach, one must consider the substantive, rather that superficial, essence of often misunderstood words like "love" and "freedom" (both are "good", neither is necessarily "nice"). And, like quantum entanglement, freedom is so complex as to be fundamentally mysterious to any human observer who would pretend to be its judge, as certain theologians have variously stated for more than 2500 years. Much argument is distilled into little in the book's three closing paragraphs (so what was the point?). This is Davies at his worst. He improved with age, read his 'The Mind of God' instead 
 I had high expectations when my homeschooling mommy friend shared with me her copy of "Five in a Row".  I had read the reviews of this curriculum and was excited to at long last be looking at it myself.  My excitement was short lived to say at best.  The author Jane Lambert basically has copied the ideas of Marjorie Nelsen and Jan Nelsen-Parish, authors of "Peak with Books" but with a right wing fundamentalist twist.  As the Bible says "There is nothing new under the sun".  Don't waste your time purchasing this overpriced, overrated curriculum, purchase "Peak with Books" instead as I did 
 while the verbatim has burned well in 100% of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players 
 This book is more about his autobiography, and albiet amusing at times, isn't a real investing book. His other one: Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World is much better 
 As the past reviewer I did not arrive to the page with THE END printed on it, and I really hate to be unable to finish a book. Anecdote aside, I am aware that my review lacks proper grounds, but since there is so much to  read and too little time, I strongly suggest you to look for other works of  this author. During the first chapter I seems to be going great, the drama  was cleaver and catchy. But suddenly in the second chapter it just stops  and all the events seem to be going nowhere. Besides the construction of  the language is boring and confusing. It feels like the author worked in  this novel for a while, then left it during some years locked in a closet  and one fine day decided to complete it, but without being at ease doing  so 
 yes i got the dvd BUT IT WILL NOT WORK ON MY DVD PLAYER AS IT IS IN THE CODE 1 AND WE CAN NOT GET IT TO WORK SO WHEN YOU SEAND THESE THING  DONT YOU THINK YOU SHUD PUT THEM IN THE PLACE IT IS GOING TO  SO AS YOU SEE I DONT NO WHAT IT IS LIKE AS IN AUSTRALIA IT IS REAGEN  
 Despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release, I need to be honest and explain why I am giving just one poor star. No, I am not crazy. Let me explain my point-of-view, and after that you can decide if this JH album really deserves more stars. Just to start, this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band(?) or the musicians thru a solid path. There are tracks played by a duo, trio, 4tt, and sometimes a very loose quintet, and each of these tracks have a different mood, without any presence of a jazz soul, or even a real smell of jazz. Maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage/tribute to Mr Strayhorn, or maybe a recognition for Mr Henderson value in the 20th century Jazz History as one of the most important hard-boppers ever. But the result was very poor. If you really love Joe Henderson (as I appreciate), try any of his albums from the 60's (as a band-leader or as a sideman), mainly those from the Blue Note era. In time: I gave one star, in memory of his brilliant carreer. This particular album deserve zero-star. 
 I have been involved with Lean for 10+ years and have served as an internal consultant and internal change agent for the last several years.  I am always looking for material that helps me to learn about new ideas or helps others pick up the tools and concepts, but was very disappointed in this book.  It is a collection of "best practices", but only touches on a few concepts from a very high level, with the "we had a problem, we waved a magic wand, and it was fixed" format.  There is nothing in this book that helps you figure out how to apply the concepts to what you are working on or that gives you new ideas to try.  You're much better off figuring out how to apply VSM in the office, having everyone look at the process, and then develop a future state together than trying to get anything from this book 
 Professor Gumerlock makes an excellent point in the introduction of his book, in summing up the LCD of all the soothsayers and so-called "prophets" throughout recorded history.  Very good arguments are also made in the opening to set the "actual time" certain prophecies were made.  But then, and even by Professor Gumerlock's own admission, this "book" carries on in the manner for which was its' main purpose; to gather in one end-all publication all of the prophecies made - and the prophets who orated them, in chronological order.  Great if you're doing an essay or report on the subject at hand...pretty dry material if you're on the outside wanting a provocative read on the subject.  Amazingly well-researched, footnoted and referenced, but again - very dry material.  I got the point after the introduction.  
 The Forsaken (J. S. Cardone, 2001 )  I should probably know better by now. And yet I still subject myself to J. S. Cardone movies.  In this one, Sean, a guy (Dawson's Creek's Kerr Smith) hired to drive a car from Los Angeles to Miami picks up a hitchhiker, Nick (Final Destination's Brendan Fehr) in the middle of the desert. The two of them encounter Megan, a sick girl(Coyote Ugly's Izabella Miko) when they stop for the night in town. Nick insists she come with them, saying he knows what's wrong with her, and eventually tells Sean that the group have vampires on their tail. (Well, the word "vampires" doesn't exactly crop up seriously, but come on, you know what they are.) The rest of the movie can be summed up with "things blow up."  Cardone is one of the straight-to-Sci-Fi-Chanel directors who fills his movies with young-and-beautifuls who have limited (if any) acting ability, but are relatively easy on the eyes. (In their defense, this is not a new tactic; witness the brilliant film career of, say, Farrah Fawcett.) Smith is a bit above the average y-n-b in acting ability, though the other two here are right on the mark. The minor characters don't have much to go on, either, as the script came straight out of a "write your first screenplay in twenty-one days" kind of book. Which could make a passable film if you had a really original, or even a really good, fast-paced plot. Alas, no such thing exists here.  This movie deserves a mercifully quick slide into obscurity. About the only was I can imagine it having any longevity at all is if it's somehow turned into a drinking game. *  
 Said Aburish's biography of Gamal Abdel Nasser, president of Egypt 1954-1970, is an opinionated examination of one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century - a man who fifty years ago captured the imagination of the Arabic-speaking people "from the Atlantic to the Gulf".  The Suez crisis of 1956 made Nasser (as he was known) an international statesman.    The author, a controversial Egyptian-Palestinian journalist based in Nice, lived through Nasser's era stationed in various Arab capitals; he witnessed the rayyes in action many times.  He was in Damascus as the Syrian masses descended on the city clamouring for Nasser to come out and speak to them; when he did, he "spoke to them slowly, in a voice of reason and intimacy that told them he loved them too."  The world was different then.    The British and French empires were shutting shop, and the US had become the new supremo of the West.  Britain and France had carved up the Arab-speaking world between them, and most Arab governments were appointed or arranged by them; oil had been discovered in the fields of Arabia and Iraq; the Suez Canal was run by Britain and France, both of whom would not entrust the vital pathway to Egypt; Algeria was just beginning to fight for long, bloody independence from France.     In Egypt, the pashas, who were less than 2 percent of the population, owned more than 65 percent of the land and exploited millions of peasants who tenanted for them.  Furthermore, a new presence had been approved by the major powers, including the USSR: Israel.  Even the pro-West Arab governments of the day couldn't stomach this new, imposed entity, and they fought its founding, but lost.  It was at this time that a young army officer from an ordinary Egyptian background appeared.  Aburish portrays him somewhat sketchily as a brooding, serious man, an avid reader who also enjoyed playing chess, and a practical man who nevertheless placed honour and dignity first.  At first, this untested leader spoke for Egyptians, but soon he directed his rhetoric to all the Arabs.  By 1958 he had become the Arab people's undisputed leader, and various governments, including local Arab ones, resented him for it.    What did he want and why?  What happened?  How did he fare?  How did he respond to new events and ideas?  What is his legacy?  Those are the kind of questions that any biography attempts to answer.  In that respect, Said Aburish does a fair job.    Nasser possessed an almost hypnotic ability to inspire his audience and gain its trust, but Aburish says he was beholden to his people's love, unable to tell them what he really thought.  In terms of Nasser's capacity to cope with and manage the heavy dose of politicking that occurs in the Middle East, Aburish shows him certainly rising to its demands - and losing his self-control at times, but underestimating the regressive, conservative instinct of the Arab people.    In Egypt, he ruled dictator-like even when he would have won any democratic elections easily.  He discarded many opinions of the ruling circle in Egypt when he might have been better served to share his decision-making with them, and he entrusted responsibility to only those he knew to be loyal when he also knew how incompetent and corrupt they were.  In pan-Arab affairs, Aburish portrays him as making policy on the hoof; he got himself involved in Algeria, in Yemen, and elsewhere when he knew that Egypt's economy was weak, and that outside forces were conspiring against him (the USA, the USSR, Israel, and Saudi Arabia).    In private, Nasser smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and regularly worked very long hours; throughout the sixties he was not well because of diabetes and heart disease, yet he pressed on - and died at 52.  Said Aburish's biography fails in many respects; it does not possess a timeline of events; there is no map of the region; and the key characters are not introduced beforehand.  There are a few punctuation mistakes, and the text does not read well; it needed a good editor.    Aburish has his issues with Islamist movements and does himself no favours by letting us know that, and not explaining himself.  Indeed, Aburish fails to offer reasons why Nasser himself was never enamoured with political Islam.    Overall, the biography assumes the reader is familiar with events and launches into opinion too quickly.  The author does not balance well between his two responsibilities as biographer:  to narrate the various strands of story and to offer insight and opinion.  There are too many flaws in this biography; it needs a major revision. 
 Levitas' book is well written and documented but it doesn't contain much that is new.  I've been reading about the radical right for almost 20 years now and there were no surprises here, only a rewritten version of what is in about 20 other books and reports.  The subject has been exhausted and this book proves it 
 I purchased "Night of the Hunter" from MediaThrill, a website selling films on Amazon.  I have seen this film five or six times since 1962.  WARNING: the copy I got from MediaThrill has been altered and cut.  It is NOT the original "Night of the Hunter." Buyer BEWARE.  MediaThrill will not give me a refund or credit.  How is anyone supposed to know if what you are buying is the original.  If I hadn't seen "Night of the Hunter" so many times I might have forgotten the scenes that were cut, and they were significant.  Someone who has never seen the film wouldn't know. Buyer Bewar 
 I thought this book was terrible.  I don't understand why people think this author is so amazing (unless they have really low IQ's).  Yes the subject matter was interesting but the delivery was very poor.  I showed it to a friend of mine and she said, "She writes like she learned to write from watching TV."  The novel is all dialogue and very little description, which doesn't equal up to an interesting read for me.  There was little suspense, I was not sympathetic to the main character, and the attempt at romance was a joke.  You want some real suspense in a mystery revolving around the legal system?  Go read Grisham 
 A glorified cliche, this book does little justice to Shakespeare's writing ability as it isn't nearly his best work. Its marvellous dissemination and public love and recognition beffudles me. Superficial, lackluster, and diaphanous often foolish and loathsome compourtment and intelligence of the characters makes this book nothing more than a wonderful waste of valuable time. Never has Shakespeare created a work so imbued with cliches and idiocy. Basically, Romeo and Juliet is a story about two romantically-impaired "star crossed" lovers who have to avoid the obstacles presented by the feud between their families to realise and consummate their ephemeral marriage. They arent star crossed! They are inane idiots too immersed in "love" to recognize the imprudence of their actions. Their deaths were not the least bit pitiful, but risible. Cognitive, yes. Irritating, yes. Interesting? No. The utter folly of the characters is murderous, very uncharacteristic of Shakespeare who usually presents intelligent and philosophical personages. Do not base your opinion of Shakespeare on this pathetic work, he has created and transcended this one with a myriad of his other much more meaningful and enthralling plays. I d much rather recommend Midsummer Night's Dream or Hamlet 
 sorry, i just thought the book was boring and worst of all, its a good story with alot of food for thought, but it was just written so poorly that it was ruined 
    This book is simply the rantings and tantrums of a man who cannot get God to answer to Him, so in prideful defiance, chooses to lose his own soul and walk away from the very One who created it.  The author has clearly never experienced a relationship with Jesus Christ. If he had, his title would have been "Why I rejected Christ" This author describes himself as an "apologist"--that would mean "explainer of a particular religion".    He also reveals that it was the "Christian community" who let him down when he was in crisis.  God is not mocked. Trials will draw out what is in the heart. Trials will reveal true believers and false converts. So the title of his book would have been more appropriately titled "Why I gave up trying to be a fake Christian".   It is only KNOWING and loving God through the shed blood of Jesus Christ that constitutes a Christian. NOT some title of "Christianity" or apologetics.    It's NOT about theology. It's NOT about religion. What is it about? It IS about relationship.  Something that only comes from faith.    People will ALWAYS let you down. But God never fails. I would not recommend you waste your time on this book.     If you want to know about Christ, I recommend you start by reading the book of John and Revelation in the authorized King James Bible.     There is no subject more important than eternal salvation. There are many that would try to lead others astray. They are the blind leading the blind.  This book is one of them.     
 Nice cover pictures and headlines, but way too many ads.  There's a reason its only twelve bucks, this is an ad-sponsored mag 
 First I want to state all the good things about this book - because they are certainly the principles of this book.  Dr. Andrew Weil's Eating Well for Optimum Health holds a wealth of information. Starting with the chemistry of how your body handles food and then explaining how that affects the goods and bads of what's out there is the basis in which Weil promotes his theories. In a world where foods become vilified and championed alike through various 'studies'... it can be intimidating to know what you should include in an 'optimum diet'. Weil clears a lot of this up and is pretty specific about what vitamins, minerals, whole foods and nutrients we should be nourishing our body with. All in all this is a great book on the science of food.  Now, for the bad part. I actually finished this book over a weekend, sick in bed, about a month ago. I was 'sick of being sick' as some would say and devoured (pardon the pun) this wealth of knowledge. After I was well enough to get back to my routine, I threw away almost every single food item in my kitchen, as almost nothing adhered to the optimum plan. I was still very motivated with my bare cupboards and then set out to turn my family's life around.   Dr. Weil makes it pretty clear that you are going to pretty much have to go exclusively organic, bar a few, and I mean few, fruits and vegetables. He even states that some non-organic fruits and vegetables are so toxic in their non-organic state you should never consume them - strawberries for example. Something Weil will also state is the pesca-ovo-vegetarianism diet is his diet of choice, because almost all meats are riddled with hormones that greatly impact our own bodies. The optimum food pyramid doesn't really include animal proteins, so if you aren't a vegetarian, you'll have some serious issues to resolve.  He tells you he loves food, and feels anyone who misses the point and stops enjoying food is wasting their time. I totally agree, but in practice, this book does just about that. Demonizing foods based on the fears of cancer and inflammatory disease can be a difficult pill to swallow, particularly if you've consumed these foods all of your life. The nature of label reading and being a smart consumer can literally drive you insane. It's certainly beneficial, we know that, but making it a lifestyle will require more then just a bit of education.  This book also is not for anyone seeking weight-loss through diet modification. Weil explains it certainly can be done, but he spends more time telling you what diets, such as Atkins, not to partake in. This fact is actually not a negative side to the book. However given the nations statistics on obesity I think this could have been a more helpful aspect of the book if he developed it.  I will end with this: This book could/would be an incredible useful tool if you were any or (ideally all) of the following:  1. You are wealthy. Try buying exclusively organic. It's outrageous. Most working families can not afford this lifestyle, contrary to the notion that prepared and processed foods are expensive. Prepared and process foods are cheap - that's why Americans consume them at such high rates. He suggest to organic co-op farms, but even as late as 2006 they can be scarce for most people in the suburbs, and when you do find them, they will only be cheaper then buying organic from natural food stores and chains, which isn't saying much. Don't be shocked when you find vine-ripened organic tomatoes at $5.99 a pound.  2. You do not work. Almost exclusively cooking from scratch, which is even acknowledged by Weil, will be the hardest transition for anyone who works full-time or has a family. This is probably the saddest aspect of this book. There certainly is nothing wrong with from cooking wholesome, healthy meals from scratch - but it isn't the norm for most people. If you buy the foods recommended, you'll be spending about 70% of your day in the kitchen if preparing 3 meals.   3. You already lead a healthful and active lifestyle. If this is you then you probably already knew much of Weil's intuitive advice and therefore will need only tweaking to adhere to the optimum plan.  My personal experience with this book is that you can back yourself into a corner with fear. If you work and have a family I suggest you skip this book. Working in your 5+ a day fruits and vegetables, organic or not, and leading an active lifestyle is a good place to start. The Eating For Optimum Health book creates a pretty black and white picture. And we all know life isn't black and white.   
 This book's explanations vary from poor to excellent. The derivations, while they are given, are not well done. They often skip steps that leaving the reader wondering just how they got from point A to point B. The answers in the back of the book and in the instructor's solutions manual are also often incorrect. The publisher of this book also elected to put large sections of this book online instead of in the book. An entire chapter, the astrophysics section, is online, which is absolutely ludicrous for such an expensive book. Overall, this book just doesn't cut it 
 Poor man was so confused, he couldn't complete a thought and mistook his confusion for enlightenment. If he'd only seen a psychiatrist for his mother issues and latent homosexuality, maybe he'd have been able to finish more than a handful of books in his lifetime 
 This book has two key faults:  the author's unobjective/uncritical assessment of her subject and an asleep-at-the-wheel editor.  Carmel Snow seems to have been a fascinating and complex character, but the author's apparent idol/family-worship prevented her from viewing Mrs. Snow critically.  That ultimately makes the Mrs. Snow presented in this book a one-dimensional character - "Aunt Carmel who worked like a man, didn't have much time for her family, etc."  It would have been interesting to know, for example, why Bazaar's circulation numbers often didn't equal Vogue's, for all of the paeans to Mrs. Snow's editorial genius.  What were the real, business reasons for the housecleaning at Bazaar after Mr. Hearst died?  Mrs. Snow's alcoholism was almost entirely avoided until the very end, when it was presented as "Mrs. Snow liked to have several cocktails at lunch" and then noted only as the cause of a highly embarrassing social moment.  Alcoholism doesn't happen overnight, as it seems to in this book, and it would have been interested to know what effect it had on her work.  The book also suffers from the want of a good editor who could have eliminated the author's juvenile asides to the reader, e.g. "how to put it", "Pace, Nigella Lawson" etc.  
 This book is plainly boring in every way. The plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. The first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. If you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then I suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like "Barney Goes to the Zoo". Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT read this book. If you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. You WILL be disappointed 
 A catalyst for the civil war, Uncle Tom's Cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves. The book's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out, and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the African American's pain, despite being redundant, rube and rife with tautology. The story is about Tom, a slave who saves his master's daughter and is promised his freedom. But his master dies before Tom is actually freed. The family falls upon hard times and Tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named Simon Legree. Legree tried everything to degrade Tom, but Tom holds firmly to his religious convictions. 
 Sullivan was one of the best around.  But somehow he has become just another doom and gloom pundit.  He even manages to equate the Christian right with the Islamo terrorists. It is a shame to see such a talented guy become an extremist too.  His optimism has been replaced by cynicism and hate.  He used to make arguments and discuss both sides and how he ridicules others and calls them names.  
 I wish that I could give this book a higher rating than I have, for the subject matter is one that I find of enormous intrinsic interest. Moreover, Dr. Chaitin is one of the most important contributors to this field of the last 30+ years.  My reasons for being disappointed in this book may well be the reasons others enthusiastically endorse it. Dr. Chaitin himself, in his preface, places this volume as the one thing he would most wish to save were a disaster to wipe out the rest of his oeuvre.  The sub-title of the book is "A Course on Information Theory and the Limits of Formal Reasoning." This sub-heading I find to be quite misleading. The book is not a "course" on any thing -- rather, it is a collection of a very small number of informal papers that Dr. Chaitin has given in recent years, and a very large number of pages devoted to LISP programs that can be used to demonstrate aspects of his extensions to the results of Turing and Goedel. The collection of articles seem largely redundant to me; any one of the articles by itself would be sufficient to summarize the rest of the book's contents. As for the programming, that should either have been provided in the form of a CD-ROM (as only someone of a genuinely "special" nature would actually sit down and manually type in all those instructions) or a functioning URL (such URL's as do appear in the book do not seem to be working as of this writing, Mar. 2007).  I was hoping to get something more comprehenive, and that could function as a stand-alone text. This book seems to be neither. The technical details are all to be found elsewhere, and the functional aspects that might translate into an actual course of study are simply not to be found at all. Dr. Chaitin notes that the original technical work of his, published in the 60's, had a formal error that has since been corrected. Quite frankly, I would rather have that work plus a footnote regarding the later developments, than this volume which (sadly) I find of no real help. (I have since ordered and received a used, 1987 imprint of his "Algorithmic Information Theory" as printed by Cambridge.)  Alternatively, and perhaps more importantly, I would very much liked to have seen this "course" developed as a *COURSE*, rather than as three more or less popular, and largely independent, lectures. These lectures seem, at best, only to minimally build upon one another. A more integrated and coherent work that developed its subject in a step-wise manner, rather than repeating itself with only slightly different glosses, is something that I would have liked much more.  My background in logic and computer science, while not trivial, remains that of a studious and committed autodidact. It is possible that someone with less of a background in topics of formal reasoning than myself would find this book of enormous value. For me, however, it lacked both the technical details to make it a worthy struggle, and the pedagogical depth to make it of significant value 
 I purchased this guide and took it with me on a cruise to SE Alaska.  The guide has too few species listed and too little information on each species to be of any practical use.  I would not recommend it.  Ron Stoessell Londi Moor 
 Before I begin the review, I should take time to mention that I am a huge baseball fan. I rarely miss a game, follow it as if my life depends on it, and see more baseball games at the ballyard every year than I do movies. I also played when I was younger and have worked on baseball-related projects for my alma mater.  I had heard that Bull Durham was one of the best, if not the best, baseball movies ever made. As a fan of Field of Dreams and The Natural, I decided to go and rent this one. Figuring that it was about baseball I thought I couldn't go wrong, so I didn't check the ratings on any of the sites as I normally do for a movie. Big mistake on my part there.  I couldn't even make it through a half hour of this movie. There was a little bit of baseball but nothing else worth mentioning. The entire thing was about sex, and I had to look away from the TV for some time. I was hoping it would get better but it never did, and after all the sex and foul language I stopped the movie, never bothering to finish it.  I was surprised that so many people gave this vulgar excuse for a baseball film such high ratings. Looking at the summaries of the ending of the movie, it looks as if there is some baseball action later on but the female characters, who I did not like at all, seemed to persist. Unfortunately this movie is filled with sex, and I feel that it was far too inappropriate for any release.  I'm not some kid writing this, I am a mature conservative Christian. This movie should offend anyone who believes in Him. Don't believe the hype from some of the sportswriters about this one. Go and watch a real baseball game--always a much safer bet for good clean family entertainment, plus it's very unpredictable and you never know what the results will be 
 Always considered Merle as a great musician until this. Sings out of tune so much it is embarassing. Merle stick to what you konw! What amazes me is hoe someting this bad got released. It is so out of tune it is embarassing 
 I was disappointed in the latest Lincoln Rhyme mystery. The book had more twists than a Chubby Checker song and in the end they strained credibility.  Rhyme and Sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the Watchmaker. Rhyme has met his match with the Watchmaker, a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for Rhyme to follow.  Running parallel to the story of the Watchmaker, Sachs is also lead detective on her first case - a case that appears to involve police corruption. Sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt. Ron Pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to Rhyme and Sachs to solve the case.   The book introduces Kathryn Dance, a visiting Californian expert in Kinesics, the study of body language. Dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case. There is also a hint of romance with officer Sellitto which is ultimately left hanging. The information about Kinesics is interesting and Dance is a character that could have used more development.   The title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar, which is also a time of death. The book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the Watchmaker. There was some fascinating information, but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks.  The book lurches from one plot twist to the next. At first it was exciting, but after a while it became tedious. NOTHING was what it seemed. Further I found Rhyme less likeable in this book - grumpy, bossy, pedantic and sarcastic. The only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose Sachs.  At times I found the writing clumsy. Deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters, such as,        "the handsome, sardonic and impatient criminalist" I found it trite to describe Rhyme that way.   This book is not as good as earlier Rhyme mysteries.  
 I feel really sorry for the student assistants that got credit in the front of Dobb's book for their careful editing.  This book has more typos in it than any thing I have ever seen.  And if Torts law was not hard enough to understand, having to work within Dobbs sorry typos makes it that  much harder.  Content wise, the book just does not lay out Torts in any  logical order.  It is just too hard from this book to pull out what the  rule is and whether a case represents the majority view or a minority.   Defense arguments against recovery tend to get far less coverage than the  plaintiff viewpoint: That much is obvious from the books' subtitle.   Overall, it is required that you use a study supplement with this book.  I  recommend "Understanding Torts" by Larry Levine, et al.  Don't  buy this book unless some sadistic professor is forcing you too 
 Start reading Chapter 1 of this book for even just the first few pages, and for various topics, it will say to go to future Chapters.  If you take a look at those future chapters, there will be notes on the side telling you to go back to Chapter 1 or to other chapters.  You can run into infinite loops or dead ends not really picking up anything.  It is possible to maybe find what you were looking for, or find that the explanation for it is just not sufficient.  If I'm trying to look for a topic to remember, this book is not an easy read with the index either.  If you look up some topics in the index and go to all the pages listed, it may not list all the important pages.  Sometimes, when I had to look for information on something, say a "use case" for instance, then I'd look that topic up in the index.  I'd go to all the different pages listed in the index and it might not be what I was looking for.  Then I'd have to look at the side of the page of usually the lowest or 2nd lowest numbered page listed by the indexed topic, and go to the Chapter(s) listed.  When I went to those chapter(s) I'd still have to scour the entire chapter(s) until I might find what I was looking for.  An example was when I was trying to understand what one of the diagram types was, a "state diagram" I believe it was, as compared to say an "activity diagram."  Sometimes I would find out that things just weren't worded well if in there at all, and I'd have to refer to another UML book.  This book may have some good use, but I haven't found that yet.  It's hard to read and hard to look things up, and hard to learn from if you don't already know much or anything that is for sure 
 Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45 
 I have read many of Philip Pullmans other books, so I must say that my expectations for this were high and perhaps that's why I gave it such a low rating.  The whole atmosphere of this book was that of a drugstore mystery, one that is just on the shelf and nobody really buys it. The story is about a guy, Chris, that sees a girl and it is just love at first sight. Usually, if it were written right, this would definitely be a book that I would enjoy. But Philip Pullman just did not pull off what he had in his other books, perhaps it was writers block. One thing about this book is that it does not convince me that Chris and Jennys (the girl Chris loves) are truly in love. There are moments when you think, "Hey, this could be pretty interesting." But it turns out just being a false alarm. Another disappointment is that nothing is really a surprise, I guessed everything that was set up as if it should be a surprise and that totally took away from the book.  All in all, I do not recommend this book but I do recommend Philip Pullmans other books, especially the His Dark Materials series (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass). I suggest finding a better book than this to spend your time reading.  
 I have to disagree with most of the comments made by the other reviews listed so far which is why I felt compelled to write my own review.  This book was VERY hard to get into and the character development was poorly lacking. I do agree with one reviewer's comment on her use of complex words.  I found that very frustrating because they added nothing to the story line and I got tired of referencing my dictionary for meaning.  BUT...  The "mystery" was weak and the ending was very abrupt and choppy.  I also thought the ending was very unrealistic -- even for a work of fiction.  And why, why, why did she have to continue to use most of the characters' full names throughout the book?  There were also way too many characters to keep track of.  Maybe she was trying to create more suspicion but it only created more confusion. Finally, the attempt at a side plot with one of the characters was poorly executed and the twist with him was not a surprise. The only good thing about this book for me was that I got it from the library.  Sounds like Ms. Graham has it going on at CNBC... I think she should stick with that career.  
 The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper. But it is very blunt!!! And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible, unless baby's nail is very very long. If I wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing, my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head. I end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy. That worked much better. 
 When I bought this magazine subscription I was under the impression that is for the Cosmo that is sold/printed in Spain.  I was wrong.  When my first issue arrived I see that it's nothing more than the United States/English version translated into Spanish.  These 2 magazines are very different in content.  While I'll read this, I will not renew.  Just a "heads up" for anyone who wants to purchase this magazine 
 If you just married the bosses daughter and got a position you didn't work for. Then obtained your first passport to go negotiate some multi million dollor deal on your first trip to a foreign country then you may get through this book. As an independent businessman with multicultural dealing worldwide it took about 2 minutes to realize I wasted my money on this one.   Learn a bit of Chineas Business Ettiquite, be nice to people and save your money for Dim Sum 
 Reading the first chapter was the only time I actually enjoyed this book. Everything went downhill afterwards, when I realized this was just a retelling of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is a well-told classic, timeless, raw, and beautiful. Here On Earth, however, is just a poor rendition, very contrived, no spontaneity whatsoever.  The almost-complete cast of characters in Wuthering Heights is present in Here On Earth. I don't remember the names of the characters in Here On Earth but I remember their counterparts pretty well. There's your modern-day version of Catherine Earnshaw, there's the modern-day counterpart of her brother Hindley. Then there's the counterpart of Heathcliff! Surprise! Surprise! A foundling with a dark and ominous character! And then there are the neighbors: the counterpart of Edgar Linton (whom Catherine's counterpart marries), and the counterpart of Isabella Linton (whom the counterpart of Heathcliff marries). And then there's the counterpart of Catherine Jr (Catherine-counterpart and Edgar-counterpart's daughter), who falls in love with cousin counterpart of Hareton (son of Hindley's counterpart). There's also Nelly Dean's counterpart, and Linton Linton's counterpart, but that's all I'm going to say. Those of you who've read and loved Wuthering Heights, you know the rest.  It's a sad thing that this is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read. I'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels. Maybe. Or I might be open to her other novels if I've finished reading all the other books I really wanted to read first 
 This Bible verse is a sober reminder of death- the grim situation of sinful mankind separated from a holy God.  What does this have to do with the John Fante's book?  The book is as bleak and hopeless as death itself.  Some people enjoy reading about hopelessness, monotony, boredom and despair.  I don't.  Not only is the book uninteresting, but I don't even enjoy the writing itself.  Most books either have good writing, or a good story- only the great ones have both.  This one has neither, not even close.  On top of its total lack of quality, the book is unnecessarily crude.  I wish I could think of something positive about this book (usually there is something) but all I can think of is that now I know to avoid Fante's books 
 While I really have nothing against her publishing books and sharing her recipes, it is absolutely necessary that we be subjected to a daily talk show?  I have never really seen the show, but if the commercials are any introduction, she just seems really obnoxious, dull, and just plain boring.  I don't really see where she brings anything new and exciting to the table, and her voice sounds almost like chalk screeching across a blackboard.  Please, oh please, make this woman go back to the Food Network where she belongs 
  Updated 6 Oct 2005   Don't give this book to your daughters but to your mothers to remind them of the pampered life they lived while your father took all the risks and did all the hard work that allowed you to exist, survive and prosper!   It is not news to anyone that womens work is largely unpaid or low paid and of low status because reproduction largely makes it impossible for it to be otherwise for mothers. That does not mean that women are bereft of vital skills and abilities that society depends on nor that women cannot transfer these skills and abilities to the public/employment sphere. It is an unfortunate paradox that the most able women are forced by their need for career/economic/self fulfillment to refrain from motherhood and therefore refrain from passing their abilities to the next generation.   As for Farrell's manipulation of figures, anyone who knows anything about statistics knows how they can be used to prove anything and everything.   The bigger question is why do societies value men over women? The answer is obvious - while women were busy full-time producing humans and doing most of the work that kept the social group going the men had the free-time to impose a value system, play politics, impose laws etc. This they did from their own perspective and naturally, in their own self-interest and because of their biology, they felt themselves to be superior to women. No logic - pure emotion based on the feelings their male hormones led them to feel and the fact they could always use physical force.   In traditional societies people must have children in order to survive when old and/or sick. In modern societies people receive these benefits from the collective children of the society which means that people can avoid paying the costs of reproduction while still receiving the benefits.   Is raising the next generation not the fundamental economic necessity of any society?   Is it not ironic that mothers who carry the bulk of this work are impoverished because of it? And then are insulted by people like Farrell who tell them they are choosing a soft option in life and come up with solutions such as to not have children or to chase after a tiny number of jobs that may pay better and may fit in better with raising children.   Don't we all depend on the future generations being raised by mothers who are not penalized both at home and in the workplace? Is it really so strange to believe that the wealth people produce should be distributed more fairly to those who produce the people in the first place?   As more and more women choose paid work over unpaid reproductive work we are at some time going to be hit by the fact that there is no one to employ or sell to if there are no people in the first place. Nor to care for us in our old age.   So, just how important is reproduction compared to everything else? If we have a world where women are devalued both as mothers and as full humans who need to participate in the workforce and public sphere and paid accordingly then the cost of reproduction may well be the cost that women will not pay.   I suggest people should read more widely about economics such as Nancy Folbre's far more sophisticated 'Who Pays For The Kids?'. I also suggest that men try to be less emotional about 'women' and recognise how self-interest has coloured their beliefs about what males and females are capable of and are worth.   Men are not 'dying for women and chidren' any more than men ever have. What men do is 'kill' in competition with other males so they can sexually exploit as many women as possible and impregnate them with their own genes. It is self-interest and if women ever benefit it is incidental to this self-interest and not the cause of male behaviour.   Women who mated with 'starving artists' are nobody's ancestors - their children would have died before puberty. Dr Farrell cannot seem to grasp that leaving descendents required females to choose mates that provide resources - just the same as males need to choose females that have eggs and 'mothering potential' and therefore mostly under 35.   As for the Australian study showing women as full-time caretakers being the 2nd most fulfilled people - it is strange, then, that Australian women are producing so few children and are being given financial incentives to breed - as are many European countries. The US is just at replacement level but dropping.   This book could soon be irrelevant because the need for women to both breed taxpayers and to be taxpayers will make women's work worth more.   There is absolutely nothing new in this book and it has not tackled the fundamental problem of why men believe themselves to be worth more than women and why people who make people are so much poorer than those who don't. Nor does it recognize how reproductive and productive work serves both sexes and should not be used to segregate the sexes with women getting the bad deal. It paints male self-interested activities as heroic and the female's reproductive work as a gentle hobby that has no economic value in itself.   If men and women are how Farrell tries to paint us then it would seem to be illogical for women not to just enjoy their easy lives and gaze, starry-eyed, at the wonder of men. Or perhaps farrell is far more phallocentric, obnoxious and illogical than he thinks himself to be?   
 Received book expecting "david hamilton-others" material-- instead found "Hustler etc" typical approach--very dissapointed-returned book same day--(would be great if ALL photo books this subject could show some example of material,including whether bw or color)-have returned several others since trying amazon for similar/same reason. great service,tho--thanks,hondaspl.  
 The stockings were not in the package, and there is no good way to get in touch with the company that sold me outfit in the first place. My girlfriend was disappointed and I felt like a fool when no one even took the time to return my call. I will not do business with this company again 
 Again, another interesting pop-corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when Hollywood gives to him a free hand (or not so much) things go wrong.  Is not funny, Wilson and Stiller aren't interesting enough and the 70's isn't a good decade to crave for.  With this kind of films, is useful to listen to American critics, they know more about their own culture than us 
 I am afraid I was quite disappointed in this book. The review in the Times that I had read made it sound like a much more profound and important book - one I would like to own rather than just take out of the library. I had previously enjoyed other books by John Mortimer, but this book was just a collection of random musings which did not hold together at all. 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 I couldn't even make it to that "magic" fourth or fifth day when all cravings are supposed to magically disappear. From the very beginning, I was so incredibly jittery, which is 1 of the claims Hoodia reps make. I, also feel sleepy all the time, yet I can't nap and my sleep has been severely disrupted by all the jitteriness- I'm what you call TOO TIRED TO SLEEP! REALLY, how many over-the counter appetite suppressants actually work. I believe none of them work better than a placebo (and maybe that's what some of you are experiencing?). DON'T BOTHER WITH this one. A total waste of a lot of money - this stuff isn't exactly cheap, either; take your $$ and go buy some sneakers, get a little exercise & you'll be a lot better off! 
 This is my first electric shaver. I have pretty rough skin and i get a lot of ingrown hairs. I'm a dark hispanic male and the shaver isn't doing much for me. It isn't as clean of a shave as a regular blade. It does leave your skin smooth but it doesn't cut very deep as to remove all the hair. It has a great desisn and very easy to work with and to travel with but the cut is just not the greatest 
 Using this book as a required text for a brush up/seminar course for an MBA program, I've found this book did not do enough reviewing for me with regards to creating financial reports-- income statement, statement of cash flows, balance sheet, etc. I had managerial accounting, financial accounting and financial management in undergrad, however, this book still lacks the concrete basics of "what goes where on a financial report and why". Speaking to my undergrad accounting department chair, I found my opinion agreed with her's-- Kimmel is verbose and lacks clarity/simplicity for those without an accounting focus or background 
 I purchased this phone and had it shipped directly to my elderly father in another state.  The description never indicated batteries were required and it did not come with batteries.  Had I known, I would have either ordered another phone or the batteries to go along with it.  Instead, the phone sat for 2 weeks waiting for one of Dad's caregivers to purchase batteries.  Dad swears it doesn't have a speakerphone option and since I haven't seen the phone, I have no idea if it's the correct phone.  If it does have the advertised speakerphone capabilities, they are not as well marked as the other "big buttons".  I'm disappointed 
 Yet another coffee table picture book on the current styling trends of Choppers. Mr. Seate's excellent previous book, 'Choppers' touched on the origin of these great machines and then went on to showcase the current trends. Instead of this new book delving deeper into actual hand built outlaw machines from the glory days of the late 60's and 70's and the home built bikes of today, it also focuses on modern, big dollar builders. Some of the bikes featured such as the BMC bikes may be nice machines but they are production bikes and shouldn't be included here. The Bobber section does have some nice rides and Chica's stuff is pretty cool but you can find bikes like these in any current Harley biased custom magazine. The title suggests that you're going to see real outlaw choppers but this is just another attempt at cashing in on the current TV driven fad. Real chopper fans may be dissapointed 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 I bought the Cold Nose Puppy Cocker Spaniel for my 2 1/2 year old daughter.  It is impossible for her to get the toy to do anything.  We have to do it for her and half the time, I can't get the puppy to do what it does.  Also, please be aware that the puppy doesn't move.  It makes noises and wags it's tail.  The battery pack is in the stomach and the velcrow doesn't stay closed.  Not at all happy with this toy 
 The case looks great and fits well, but it's nearly impossible to remove.  I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time.  I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod.  In addition, it's too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system.  I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking 
 I usually really enjoy Jayne Ann Krentz and her alter ego Amanda Quick, but I actually returned this one to the library unfinished. I found it boring and the whole dream reader concept to be unbelievable 
 Absolutely without a doubt the best thing about Teitler's `Taming and Training Cockatiels' is the wonderful color photographs, but aren't most color photographs of cockatiels charming?  Decent photographs are  insufficient criteria to distinguish a book on birds.  The book is written  in a boring style that reads like, `look, here are my pets, aren't they  great?' The book lacks focus and unsuccessfully attempts to cover too much  material.  There are promising introductory sections intended for readers  that have never owned a bird before where instructions on making `first  contact' without terrorizing the cockatiel are given.  However, just a few  pages later there is a large section on breeding birds.  Surely it's unwise  for a novice who wants a tame, loveable pet bird to delve into breeding at  the same time?  If the author had focused on one area, such as a guidebook  for the new bird owner while avoided irrelevant distractions, I might have  been able to suggest this book 
 the movie directors in the ME, particularly Iranians, are responding to demands by the West for certain type of movies. They produce what is demanded from them; in turn, they receive awards. cultural industry empowers these demands; they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the Western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded. There is no single ME movie which depict the story of Western imperialism in the ME and then awarded for doing so. ME movies must show that ME women are in need of emancipation; ME cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized. civilization itself is presented in vertical sense; there is a civilization somewhere out there all MEasterners are expected to reach; yet, it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them. (no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country; who deprived them of education and knowledge. the West is represented by beautiful, blonde nurses, a nice American guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his "everyday Western knowledge of medicine" in the midst of total ignorance, and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs. such a nice way to civilize!) the story of Afghanistan is real. however, the movie does not render a fair job in reflecting the background of it. rather, it does an excellent job in meeting the cultural demand; in producing a product that can sell well.  the situation is miserable; but what caused such misery in Afghanistan? your answer after seeing the movie will be that it is Islam; it is that Islamic culture; that backward culture of those people with wonderful eyes. such a conclusion is strongly demanded in the absence of other factors. there is no single implying in the movie, a smallest reference, that Afghanistan has suffered centuries old imperialism at the hands of the British and then the Russian and now Americans who played their Great Game on the chessboard of Eurasia. There is a passage in the movie to the effect that somebody will come to liberate them. those imperialists came in the name of civilization; French did to Algeria, the British did to India; all in the name of bringing them civilization. It was White Man's Burden to do so. Yet Makhmalbaf needs more awards. he has to compete in the cultural circus and perform well for the pleasure of Western audiences, in order to continue to be in demand. you did a nice job, applauses; go on. (anyone who is interested in cultural imperialism should read Foucault's works and Edward Said's Orientalism. 
 I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope.  This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.    The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks!  The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful.  I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects.  Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored.  NOT recommended 
 I found this book to be a vaguely interesting dissertation on what the SHAM (Self-Help Actualization Motivational) Movement is, and maybe even on why it is, but no help whatsoever in giving me any tools for argument against it.  I thought, sucked in by the interesting cover suggesting brain-washing in such a humorous way, that the author might have a sense of humor herself and I'd find her book absorbing intellectually and on other levels as well.  I would read a page or a paragraph or two, close the book, and nod off.  This is such a fascinating area, it could be the basis for a really fascinating book, but "Self-Help, Inc..." left me feeling I needed to go to a self-help group to deal with the density of the verbage.  It would not appeal most to the people most in need of reading it  -  the victims of SHAM 
 I'm not sure how this magazine ever got the reputation for being more than the glossy fanzine it is. There's nothing wrong with celebrity mags, but this one has pretensions of so much more when essentially, it's about as deep as an E! True Hollywood Story about Kato Kaelin. I've tried many times, but alas, this one is sadly not worth the tree destroyed to print it 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 ordered the book 4 weeks ago, said it was planned for shipping the next day and still havent recieved it..... to bad i needed it 2 weeks ago!!!!! --- disappointe 
 i've never listened to the album before to be honest, but i'm giving it one star just because everyone else gave it 5 
 I can understand why there are so many glowing reviews for this book.  Mr. Merrick has vast knowledge of the ins-and-outs of the stand alone inventor's world, however, everything in the book is based only on his four small-time inventions, none of which even exist anymore (which is probably why he needed to write a book).  I have nothing but admiration for his accomplishments because few people would go through the many mundane steps he has taken, which is why I didn't find this book very useful.  In fact, after reading all the time and work it takes to becoming a true "stand alone inventor", he has convinced me that licensing is the way to go, which is the opposite effect I'm sure he was hoping for.  He talks about going to your local mom and pop stores to peddle your idea, which simply isn't possible anymore with the big chain stores.  The internet and e-mail are mentioned on only three pages, when it is the basis of most marketing today.  He mails media kits to the media when most won't even accept anything other than through e-mail anymore.  These are just a few examples of how antiquated his methods are in today's world.  It's generally decent historical information, but if you're looking for up-to-date and useful information and advice for today's inventor, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 This book isn't really about arms and armor-- it's about weapons. If you are looking for a book that is compleatley about arms and armor, then find another book, but if you want a book that is about the history of weapons, then this is the book for you. I was looking for arms and armor, and this book didn't really have that much information on it 
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 Echikson is one of these writers who feels that if he was there, whatever he saw must be described as if it were the most important part of the story. And if he wasn't there, he'll make it appear as if he was. He applied the same technique to Bernard Loiseau's quest for a third Michelin star in "Burgundy Stars," a book about gastronomy that failed to show how anything was actually cooked or what it actually tasted like.   In this volume, he muddles two good stories. First is the family upheaval surrounding the sale of Chateau d'Yquem. Second is an attempt to pin down changes in winemaking style influenced by wine journalist Robert Parker. The former is a classic drama; the latter a Wall Street Journal feature. The timeframe of these two tales overlap, and Echikson intercuts the narratives to give some vague sense that they're somehow related. No way.  Worse, it's clear, time and again, that Echikson hasn't got a clue how wine is actually made, so he relies on gossip about the winemakers. A very frustrating book. Thin, bitter, stylistically simplistic. Ptui 
 At the end of her TV shows it states  For entertainment only  So is her book for entertainment only???????????  I like Personal Finance for Dummies. Some "Dummies" books are too simple and have to many jokes but Personal Finance for Dummies is pretty good.  
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 Remember those Looney Tunes cartoons where a particularly gullible character would momentarily appear to morph into a giant sucker (lollipop)? I think that must have happened to me as I walked by this book on the store shelf....  I'll start with what I hated about this book.  * Jorge Cruise's Cruise Down Plate (R). This consists of the following: "Mentally divide the plate in half. Fill the upper half with vegetables. Then again mentally split the bottom half of the plate into two equal parts. Fill the left side with a high-protein food and the right side with a carbohydrate food. Finally, add 1 teaspoon of fat.... If you ... eat everything on your plate - and you're still hungry - you may dish yourself up another plate of vegetables.... And that's really all you need to know to use my Cruise Down Plate (R) to achieve weight-loss success." Well, no, it's really not. You have to read another 14 pages to get to the bottom of it, which actually turns out to be just another low-calorie diet. The plate gimmick barely enters into it. YAWN.  * "Visit www.JorgeCruise.com...." I was perplexed to find that there is apparently NO content on this website that doesn't require you to pay $3 a week. The one exception I found was a link to My Virtual Body, which is free. One section of the book tells you to go to www.JorgeCruise.com/localclubs to see a list of weight-loss clubs meeting in your area. Unfortunately, nothing exists at that web address. At another part of the book, Jorge encourages you to "share your story" and invites you to weekly online meetings by joining the "online club" at www.JorgeCruise.com. He doesn't mention there's a fee for this extra support. The most irritating one yet was "You can even go to www.JorgeCruise.com/music to hear selections from my personal picks of the most inspiring and moving music." What actually happens when you go to this URL is you find a "Welcome to a JorgeCruise.com Active Link!" page with a "Click here" link. When you click on the link, it takes you to www.JorgeCruise.com/shopping/videos.php. Yes, it's an online store for Jorge's $39.95 VHS tape, or one of his audio kits and books, "Jorge's favorite" exercise tools, and some nutritional supplements. No music whatsoever. While we're on the website, let me point out what the FAQ says about the books: "Can I use Jorge's 8 minute books in combination with this online plan? Although the books are excellent resources of information -- the plan presented here online is Jorge's NEWEST and might not follow the book's exercise or eating plan exactly. In order to avoid confusion, follow the online plan 100%. NOTE: We are updating all of Jorge's books to match all new materials offered here online." So now that I've purchased the book (which includes online support as part of its weight-loss plan), it's already obsolete? What was it, just an expensive advertisement for the website? Infuriating.  * Jorge's smiling face. I was getting tired of seeing it before I was halfway through the book. Every few pages there's a little sidebar with a Jorge quote, topped by a 2-inch-square photo of the man. By the end, I had difficulty resisting the urge to take up a black Magic Marker and eradicate every one of them. Whose idea WAS that?  * The exercises. Come on - soup can bicep curls and tricep kickbacks? What, have I been lying on the couch doing no heavier lifting than a can of beer for the past few years? I have 15-month-old twins, each of whom weighs about 25 lb. I carry them around ALL the TIME. Lifting one-pound soup cans for strength training is ludicrous. And how about the "lift hold" - sit in front of a table, put your palms under the tabletop and push up on the underside of the table as hard as you can. Well, I don't own a solid marble table, so if I tried this I'd have the table flipped over off its feet before any real benefits accrued to my strength. If you're 70 years old or just have not lifted anything heavier than your purse for the past several years - and I'm not knocking you if that's the case - these exercises might be useful. For me, they're laughable. And I'm not THAT strong.  There's more, but those are the major points.  So what made me give this book 2 stars? Strictly this: It's packed with all kinds of motivational tools. This is something I'd never seen to this extent in a weight-loss book, and I think they might actually help me (with the glaring exception of his online support "club," as I refuse to shell out the bucks for it). There are journaling tips, lists of empowering books, weight-loss websites, motivational magazines, etc. So I think I might actually be able to adapt some of it for myself. It might even be worth what I paid for it, if I can get past my annoyance with the rest of it... 
 This was terrible. I returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with Apple Support Desk.   The product will probably be better with future software updates, but in my experience, it was fairly unreliable in its current state. Examples of problems: wouldn't download drm managed content online, had problems when downloading itunes purchased music (the first time I've had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes), couldn't connect to my corporate VPN, and finally, just as evidence of the lack of QA on this device, the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the Apple Extreme. The images were of the previous white, button-shaped device.  This was a genuine disappointment, and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad QA.  Others seem to have had more success, but I'm back on my 802.11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared 
 Let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic. Regardless of the fact that it didn't stick with a few key plotlines in the book, everyone still did a great job adapting the original Jurassic Park. Then came this piece of trash...  Whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book, this one just takes the brilliant writing of Michael Chrichton and throws it directly out the window.   First off, John Hammond is supposed to be dead. He dies at the end of the first novel. Secondly Ian Malcome is supposedly dead, or at least MIA at the end of the first book, and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd. There is no bratty daughter, and the entire premise has much more to it.  MOST IMPORTANTLY... the entire ending in san diego with the T-Rex... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies... did not exist in the book!   I went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot, a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist, and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off. What I ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page. Not only that... but because of the lack of plot, the dino scenes are complete over-kill. When you see so much of it, you lose that awe and wonder of the first film. When you see that Brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film, the wonderment is difficult to rival. There are no such moments in this film.  If you're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino FX, go nuts. However, if you're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline, flick off the dvd player and pick up the book.  Oh and one more thing... don't go NEAR the 3rd movie. They didn't even have a book to be untrue to. I can't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one 
 This book didn't make that much sense to me as far as a plot goes. It was mainly pornography. I like steamy scenes as much as anybody but after a while, for me, the repeated sex got tiring. Merinus (not a very attractive name) was a contradiction. She claimed to be able to do the job of tracking down Callan Lyons and getting him to open up to her. She finally talks her stubborn brothers, who were major irritants, into letting her do this and then she proceeds to make so many blunders that it was hard to take her seriously. Perhaps this book wasn't the right one to read first as this is a series but the plot just wasn't there. There was a bit of disjointed story in between bouts of sex. I liked Callan but Merinus was also an irritant. There was just no meat to this story. If you like steamy sex scenes and plenty of them, then this is the book for you. If you like a plot too, then maybe this isn't one you'll enjoy. 
 I ordered this item in June.  After repeated emails and phone calls Macys did not ever deliver it.  It was going to be a wedding gift.  At one point a double boiler was delivered instead.  After 3 months of frustration I cancelled the order from Macys and had the same item delivered in 5 days from another source.  It was incredibly poor service.  Nothing wrong with the wok itself -- the bride reports being quite happy with it 
 Just imagine what the Trevor Howard / Celia Johnson would  [could?] have been like IF they had this freedom???  Also imagine the make-up artist ['hair' dresser?];  and the, err ....  focus puller on this one's set ......  No, no, no!  Although rather brave - who the heck cares?  It's all very natural and somewhat vaguely contemporary, but really - WHY bother?   As our beloved Peter Finch [I think] said in "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" - here come those boring old  T..s again!"  As for safe sex?   [The lady during a half-pant or two - breathlessly demands 'protection' from the, err..'intruder' .... UNREALISTIC, regarding the intensity of their meeting{s}, and their obsession with each other's body parts].  Simone Signoret and Laurence Harvey were by far more interesting in their plastic raincoats on a windswept beach [ditto Kerr and Lancaster].  Brando/Schneider also Bogard/Rampling were FAR more tortured in their versions along the same theme.  then ... we WILL always have "Intermezzo"/"In the Realm of the Senses".   
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 Amazon.com is such a pleasure to deal with. The representatives are courteous, helpful, and accomodating. I had the pleasure to experience this myself when I was returning this piece of trash. Mr. Godek came up with a dozen or two "o.k." (but nothing extraorinary) ideas and filled up the rest of the space with quintessential garbage. My fellow Amazon customer, I wish you all the best because, like me, you are on the path to becoming a true romantic for the woman you love. That's very noble, and I couldn't respect that more. That's why I say to thee: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND NERVE CELLS! This book is not the one you need. Allow me to recommend another one: "How to Romance the Woman You Love - The Way She Wants You To." By Lucy Sanna and Kathy Miller. The ISBN is 0761508708. Good luck 
 I give this book 2 stars for the occasional first person insights into the Doors. But there is too little of it. There is too much of the rantings of a man who is apparently trapped in the 6os, and is undergoing a personal mind battle between himself as a flower child and a business man. He often comes on as one or the other of these two conflicting images.  Often he rants about the establishment and their love of power and money, but at the same time he exudes great excitement when he describes the business and money aspect of his music career; like the big bucks he got when 'Light my Fire' hit the charts and the new car and beach house he was able to then buy. Or when he describes getting his first royalty check from Elektra and "Grinning and Dithering" while he makes his wife guess at the figure. Then she "squeals" and they hug and yell "We're rich!" A few pages later he goes on ranting about power and money hungry people.  I found too much hypocrisy in his writing like when he keeps using the phrase "I hope the lovers win the war. Don't you?" Then a few pages later he comes on as anything but a lover with his nasty second-hand gossip about Morrison allegedly telling him that he didn't like John Desmore. Uh, wouldn't a true lover and person who preaches peace and goodwill amongst each other, have kept that to himself rather than basically telling the world "Jim liked me more than John." I mean, what does that serve other than hurting another man's feelings? Nasty stuff from a self professed lover of people.  "Break On Through" is a much more supperior book on this topic. And it is a shame. Because with Manzarek's personal insight into the group, he could have provided the greatest story....But instead he chose to hog the spotlight and put too much of himself, his hypocritical pseudo hippy rantings, and his mean spirited jabs at others who were a part of this chapter in his life, into this book. I was hoping for more. Instead he delivered mostly junk 
 If I had the option to, I would permanently ban Conway from ever writing another book. She gleefully displays her lack of knowledge on a plethora of topics, from basic Wicca to Ceremonial Magick, to history and mythology, and the list goes on and on. If this book were shelved under fiction, it would be better, but it purports to knowledge that is obviously made up on the spot, with no historical references cited.  In short, buy the book for a chuckle. Serious practitioners of the Craft and the Art should look elsewhere for instruction 
 I to had the misfortune of buying this book for a class (European Idealist) and found it to be of no help.  You only explore parts of texts and the introductions themselves are of no help 
 This was the worst darn book I ever read.  I read it last year and never want to read it again.  It was about a person who turned into an owl and called chinese food "food of the gods."  Don't make the mistake of buying or reading this book.  It was terrible.  I hated it.  If you like dumb books, definetly buy this!!!!!!! 
 I wish I could rate this item that was meant to be part of a Christmas present for my daughter. Although, when I placed my order mid-december it was shown as available, my daughter still hasn't received it, that's well over a month.... Obviously, I wouldn't have bought it if I'd been told it would take so long...I'm very disappointed. 
 You went to the Family Values tour, what a poser!!  Thrash fans aren't sociopathic devil worshipers.  I'm a devout atheist and I'm not seen as a sociopath among my friends.  Infact, many of my metal brethren are very nice people and devout Christians.  You nu-metal (not "alt" as you want it to be) kids are just pathetic wiggers who have no potential in life.  Many thrash fans might abuse alcohol, but they're way higher on the ladder than you nu-metal kids.  Plus, your statement about thrash/death metal bands being "xerox" copies of each other is asinine; listen to Dream Theater's "Images and Words," Death's "Sounds of Persiverance," and Slayer's "Reign in Blood;" I dare you to say they have the same "formula."  And metal bands do evolve, if you say every album in Death's and Morbid Angel's discography sounds the same, you should jump off the Sears Tower.  There's way more thrash/death metal fans out there than you think, just because REAL metal isn't mainstream doesn't mean its a joke.  Oh yeah, among normal people, us metalheads have way more respect than you Korn Kidz, as we don't hang out behind liquor stores wearing ICP shirts, talking to each other in Ebonics, and passing each other a bottle of Thunderbird wine complaining about how our lives suck.  Before you criticize us metalheads, look at yourself, you retarded mallcore kid.  Now to this, not even Korn's "best" songs are any good.  This album isn't necessary because if you heard one Korn song, you've heard them all.  This is a big waste of money, if you want greatest hits albums, get Megadeth's greatest hits album along with Steve Vai's 
 I have been a fan of Western Digital hard drives for many years, but that ended with this product. I purchased an Essential Edition 250GB drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift, by New Years it was DOA. Giving WD the benefit of the doubt, I exchanged it for an identical replacement. This one made it until early March. Three clicks and it turns off. WD says there is nothing I can do, but I return it under a RMA. They can do nothing about the lost data. So much for using this drive for backing up important files. I've have had at least a dozen WD drives over the years and never had a failure, they just became obsolete because of their size. This product however....STAY AWAY 
 If you love the O'Malley Series, don't even pick this one up.  The depth, and character develpment so wonderfully dispalyed in the O'Malley Series in missing in this book.  It seems the author was rushed, and didn't get a complete story prior to publishing 
 This book was good but not terrific. after reading best sellers like Why we want you to be rich by Donald TRump and God Doesn't run a $2 Shop by Sage Saint Francis i found that this book just was not in the same leauge.  This book,for me,just did not live up to my expectations of it, i mean the two books mentioned above changed my life, and actually got me the result and financial freedom i was after but they are not for everyone.  In this book I found this information to be very simple and at times misleading...at best!  I do not feel this is the authors best work, however i still believe it is a good investment and a descent place to start. 
 Rebeccasreads highly recommends WHY WE GARDEN as an almanac of helpful tips from a Pacific Northwest gardener's decades of experience, along with musings on the "Zen of gardening", & yet it is much, much more -- it is the story of how to take inspiration from the history of the written word, & epiphanies from global cultures.  Come walk with this gardener (who, by the way, talks to whales) as he plants a treeling that will live a thousand years, & get a glimpse of TIME as you've not known it.  Come sit a while in his gardens while he shows us the "temporal charisma" of the PLACE wherein we finds ourselves.  Come wander in this gardener's wonderings as he unearths the roots of our ancient yearnings about paradise to our more recent ideals of utopia.  Month by month, Jim Nollman takes us out where the wild things grow,  where spirit, mind & body come together in the most enduring of our "pastimes" -- digging up healing, planting hope & harvesting contentment.  WHY WE GARDEN is a mystery -- no matter where we do it -- atop highrises,  in window boxes, on city blocks, or where the trees outnumber the houses -- wherever we garden, that is where we dig up our souls & nurture our own unfurling.  Much to learn, relish, think on -- all year long, for the rest of our lives. WHY WE GARDEN is the perfect gift for your gardening friends 
 Very low quality and I am very surprised that Kitchenaid puts its name on this product.  I highly DO NOT reccommend this product.  I agree with all the other reviews about this product and was in denial until I bought one myself 
 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt 
 I thought I can learn something new from this book but there is nothing extraordinary in it.  The author tells his story rather than emphasize the critical decisions he made to get to a million dollar sales.  This book is more of a rookie entrepreneur's guide to starting a business.  The information he offered is common knowledge to business people like me and could be found FREE over the internet and the library.  Don't waste your money on this book.  If you want real world advice the safest bets are Robert Kobiyashi, Suze Ormon, Harvey Mackay and Steven Covey 
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 The information itself is useful enough, although as others have mentioned it's essentially what's in the manual. The bigger problem that I ran into was that after 3 months the binding fell apart and pages began to fall out of the book! Perhaps that explains the new edition 
 Wow how the hell someone can watch this a think it was good just boggels my mind.  I've seen this piece of crap two times once by accident and i couldnt turn it off cause i was laughing so hard at how pathetic it was. The second time because it was on H.B.O and i read the previous reviews that said it was an awesome movie and had to see if i was just mistaken.  OH MY GOD the acting , directing and visual affects is probably the worst i have seen in a while.  It make little nickey or overdrawn at the memory bank look like  5 star movies.  The dialoue is so ridiculous there where tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.  My favriote scene has to be where king arthur and is men charge a semi truck .  Also when lancalote and merlin go for a ride on a water slide in a cavern is also pretty damn funny.  So kuddos to the director and writer for making the worst movie of all time. So well played Phil Matthews for creating the the filmthe brings face back to adam sandler for doing little nicky or the Raul julia for doing overdrawn at the memorey ban 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 Okay...I bought this book to find out how big this tank was!...guess what...nowhere in this book...(a book ON THE SHERMAN TANK no less)...can I find how long this tank is!!!...how wide this tank is. You would think that this would be basic information on the subject. What possible excuse could there be for not having this info readily available in a book on the Sherman tank. Beats me..if anyone can help, please recommend a book where I can find this information 
 I recommend the writer of this book for future readings but, I do not like the books "Christina Aguilera: A Star is Made," the singer is good but hearing the life story of the same singer everywhere gets tiring. I hope this review helped 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 This attempt to extend a masterpiece of poetic philosophizing on matters a woman ponders at mid-life is a whiney and disappointing series of personal complaints in the self-congratulatory self-pity mode followed by trite  self-help suggestions at the end of each chapter 
 The animal rights issue is a tricky one, because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious, to have rights, and to experience suffering.  So you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward.  If so, you would be disappointed by this book.  The first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book.  Singer argues that there's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans, since different humans have different abilities.  Therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person's interests.  Since animals have interests too, they deserve equal treatment.  That's it.  It's not terribly deep, and frankly not even rational, but Singer doesn't bother to elaborate.  So if animals have interests, then they obviously have an interest in not suffering.  How do we know animals are capable of suffering?  According to Singer there are two signs:  they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans.  He doesn't say how he came up with these criteria, but they seem awfully generous to me.    In fact, based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation.  Monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations, and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech.  And humans actually can echolocate (with a lot of practice).  The point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation, and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans.  Could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering?  I don't think anyone knows, and Singer doesn't shed any light on the subject.  The next chapter is about animal testing, and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments.  This is the weakest part of the book.  Singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history, and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless.  He mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments don't involve pain, but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped.  Part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments don't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress.  This idea is unfortunately quite common among people who don't know anything about medicine or science.  However it's completely incorrect, and most of Singer's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked.  For example, he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy, even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing.  In addition to being totally confused about science, Singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself.  He repeatedly suggests that animal testing should, in the short term, be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment.  This is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them.  Science doesn't work this way.  At one point (p. 47), Singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown "first to prove a theory, then to disprove the theory, and finally to support modified versions of the original theory."  This probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher, but it's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method.  The next chapter deals with factory farming, and here Singer is on firmer ground.  As in the previous chapter, there's no philosophy, or even rational discourse.  It's just page after page of description, in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm.  However, in contrast to the chapter on experimentation, the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals.  Here it would seem that there's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans (although I imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990).  The next chapter deals with vegetarianism, calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products.  Again the appeal is basically emotional, and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter, you will presumably find this chapter convincing.  Curiously Singer doesn't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment, even though the argument would be identical.  Even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine, you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research.  Anyone who's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes, or who has ever had surgery, or who takes prescription drugs, is contributing to animal suffering.  Maybe Singer deals with this in another book, but given the chapter on vegetarianism it's a rather obvious omission.  The next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals, going back several thousand years.  It might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book, but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers.  The last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments.  Singer doesn't draw any line between violent organizations like the Animal Liberation Front (which the FBI considers a terrorist organization) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way (like the ASPCA).  He speaks positively of PETA, which in addition to other extremist activities, supports violence and arson.  I don't know why he would do this.  Ultimately this is a bad book.  It trivializes a serious issue by  substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation.  The fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals.  In the realm of science, there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing.  With other behaviors, such as meat-eating, the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater.  How we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that Singer doesn't even attempt to take seriously 
 o.k., i just finished listening to the C.D. of Predator, which i had downloaded on my I-pod.   Well, i kept thinking the book was abridged, or maybe i had made a mistake in the download.  It jumped around so much that i was convinced it was abridged, but it wasn't!  i have so many questions, i can't even list them all, and think maybe we should all form an on-line group to see if any of us can answer them.  1. was Johnny the doctor killed or was it suicide?  and who killed him, and most importanly, WHY?    2. why were the members of the family killed and how were they known by the serial killer? 3. when did Kay and Benton make up, and why the heck is she always so angry? this is just the beginning 
 THIS WAS FOR A FRIEND AND I HAVE NO FEEDBAC 
 I have a few of Santanas earlier albums on vinyl and i'm in the process of buying CD versions. My wife bought me 'Supernatural' as a present.  There are a few good tracks but I found it disappointing, given that it was a big commercial success. Tracks fall into two categories - collaborations with some contemporary artists (most of which don't work for me), and music that is reminiscent of the band's earlier work  I rate the tracks as follows :  DE LA YALEO   4/5 Strong Afro-Latin feel, jazzy piano and guitar solo.  LOVE OF MY LIFE   2/5     Unexceptional.  PUT YOUR LIGHTS ON   1/5     Boring and repetitive.  AFRICA BAMBA   4/5    Latin/Mexican feel, wistful guitar sound.  SMOOTH   2/5      Unexceptional, guitar solo OK but rather 'safe' and predictable.  DO YOU LIKE THE WAY   0/5     A mess, awful.  MARIA MARIA   3/5  A decent mainstream pop song (a bit 'soppy'). Liked the lead vocalists voice, clean (if somewhat unadventurous) guitar licks.  MIGRA    5/5  Great guitar playing, nice horn arrangement, solid percussion.  CORAZON ESPINADO   2/5   Unexceptional but pleasant enough.   WISHING IT WAS   2/5  Fluent guitar solo, but otherwise unexceptional.  EL FAROL   3/5  Relaxed but unexciting, but enough good guitar playing to make it very listenable.  PRIMAVERA   1/5     Monotonous and predictable.  THE CALLING   2/5  Collaboration with Eric Clapton. Neither guitarists do themselves justice. Background vocals are repetitive and tedious. Too long.   A lot of people think 'Supernatural' is great and probably think I'm totally lacking in musical taste. All I can say is that if you liked those tracks rated 4 or 5, and you are not familiar with Santana's earlier work, then check out 'Abraxas', 'Caravanserai', and 'Borboletta'; There are also some good compilations - 'Moonflower', in particular, is worth a listen as is the Santana 'Best Instrumentals' on the Sony label.   
 Although the revised editions of the Nancy Drew books never lived up to the originals in my opinion, the writing was always decent...But then around volumes #27-#30, it really started to decline,and became what I call poor quality. It seemed as if the writer('s) really did'nt care what thier readers would think of thier work, just as long a they got thier pay check, they were happy. And the art is atroucious! The cover paintings arent too bad, but its the illustrations inside the books that really show the lazziness of the artist. I really liked the original illustrater's (which was Russel Tandy) approach. He would first actually read the whole book before going to work, unlike Nappi who would doodle a few pencil drawings that looked as if they came from a generic color book from Big Lots... I dispies this garbage.. 
 It's hard to be too hard on this pretentious wad of snarling anti-reason, bleary new-age fog, wishful thinking, truely impressive ignorance of the genuine diversity of aboriginal cultures everywhere, or the centrality of Western science and reason to any successful human(e) endeavor in today's world. This book is an achievement of sorts -- many tin-type pictures; an out-of-date bibliography; an angry and assertive posture characteristic of the most herniated PC hype, guaranteed to appeal to a certain "cultivated" mindset; nice drawings and maps. This book is typical of current POMO (post-modernist) "historical" nonsense in a pretty package, a pastiche of the visually appealing with the intellectually bankrupt. Bruce Chatwin redux. 
 I usually buy second hand "new" items. This book was deteriorated. Far away from brand new, just like new and so on descriptions.    
 I found the book had some ideas that helped, but it was unrealistic in many ways.  I am spiritual, but I didn't appreciate the religious opinion it gave 
 The Institute for Creation Research promotes Scientific Creationism (SC) as a textbook for high school and college students, and many reviewers were impressed by the "scientific facts" in SC. But how scientific is it, really?    I estimate the number of quotes in the book at about 400 in the "science" section of the book, and about 400 more Bible references in the last part of the book. What kind of bizarre science textbook has that many quotes OR that many Bible references???     Furthermore, Morris and others at the Institute for Creation Research have a very unsavory reputation for dishonesty, including distorting quotes, so any book he writes that contains so many quotes is especially suspect.    Some specific problems:    Chapter 1: Evolution or Creationism?   Morris said all monotheistic faiths are inherently creationist.  Wrong!  Christianity is a monotheistic faith, and millions of Christians are evolutionists!    Morris also said atheism is inherently evolutionist.  That's wrong too.  Raelians are atheists.  They are also anti-evolutionist.     Morris relies very heavily on ad hominem arguments.  For example he said the Nazis were evolutionists.  Not only are ad hominem arguments illogical, but in this case, they are also factually wrong.  Hitler's "Mein Kampf" is clearly creationist, some of Hitler's racist beliefs are echoed in Morris's own statements, and Hitler's racism is echoed by other creationism-supporting groups, such as the KKK.    Chapter 2: Chaos or Cosmos?   Morris said stars have never changed for as long as man has been observing them.  Wrong!  Numerous supernovae have been observed throughout history.   Chapter 3: Thermodynamics.   Morris claims the second law of thermodynamics makes ALL increases in order impossible, which allegedly makes evolution impossible.  But Morris himself describes systems where increases in order ARE possible: seeds growing into trees and fetuses growing into babies.  Interestingly, all of Morris' "exceptions" involve biological organisms, so Morris' own examples indicate that increases in order ARE possible in biology, DESPITE the second law.   Morris says not one new species is known to have evolved during recorded history.  Wrong!  Some web sites list hundreds of them.  Even Morris' colleague, Duane Gish, indicates that over 25,000 new worm species could have evolved from a single pair following Noah's Flood.  That's a lot of "impossible" evolution!  Chapter 4: Accident or Purpose?   Morris said in Chapter 2 that statistics are ALWAYS invalid in analyzing one-time events, but in this chapter Morris calculates the probability of life evolving, something Morris himself says was a one-time event.  Apparently he's too clueless to see the inconsistency there.    Morris bases ALL his statistics on the assumption that only one combination of genes, proteins, etc., will work.  Wrong!  There's 6 billion people and billions of other organisms on the planet right now, all of them with unique combinations of genes, proteins, etc.  For Morris to ASSUME that only one set of genes will work is simply stupid and completely invalidates his statistical arguments.   Morris says ALL life forms appeared simultaneously in the Cambrian, but then lists fourteen groups that started hundreds of millions of years earlier or later, including insects, flowering plants, and trilobites.  Apparently he's too clueless to see the inconsistency.  Morris' most RECENT citation on transitional forms of plants is 1951.  Unbelievable.   Chapter 5: Uniformitarianism.   Morris says rocks are dated SOLELY by their fossil content.  Wrong!  Moon rocks and meteorites don't contain ANY fossils; and in ancient rocks, the rocks themselves are not dated, rather it is their minerals that are dated, and minerals don't contain ANY fossils either.  What a dunce.   Morris repeatedly refers to fossil graveyards containing hundreds of billions of fossils caught in Noah's Flood. ALL those fossilized animals lived at the same time, according to Morris, and that's simply impossible.  For example, according to Morris, oil is the converted remains of billions of marine animals caught in Noah's Flood.  Since it takes 880 million tons of organic remains to make 1.1 billion barrels of oil, the known oil reserves in the world today (not even counting oil already taken out!) would indicate that TRILLIONS of tons of invertebrates were ALL living at the SAME time and in the SAME few places!  Impossible!    Morris says hydrodynamic sorting sorted rocks by size and weight during Noah's Flood, but he describes a huge blanket of heavy conglomerates that ended up HIGHER than much lighter sandstones and silts.  How'd that happen???  Morris's "scientific theory" violates the law of gravity!  According to Morris, Noah's Flood was so powerful that entire mountains were washed away, the fountains of the deep exploded world-wide, and the continents were blasted apart a distance of 2,000 miles or more.  But Morris relies on "ecological zonation" to explain fossil sequences.  Ecological zonation implies that that little minnows, frogs, lizards, mice, and rabbits all remained undisturbed in their ecological niches despite the Flood.  So entire mountains were washed away, but minnows, turtles, and rabbits remained in place???  Unbelievable.  The Paluxy "man-tracks" allegedly overlapping dinosaur tracks are described as "conclusive" "known" proof that dinosaurs lived at the same time as men, even though the ICR acknowledged twice in 1986 that the "man-tracks" had been debunked (i.e., they weren't actually human tracks).  Morris also tells his readers to watch a video documentary on the subject, even though the film was withdrawn from distribution following the tracks' debunking.  One lie on top of another, still being promoted as true today.  Chapter 6: Old or Young?   Speaking of old, the quotes in this section are badly out-dated, often from the 40's and 50's, when radiometric dating was in its infancy. For these ancient quotes to be used fifty years later in a "modern" textbook is simply shameful, a perfect example of Morris' dishonesty in using quotes to mislead people.  If a stock promoter used such tactics, he'd be prosecuted for securities fraud.  Out of 9 citations on the evolution of man, 8 were from 1973 or earlier, and one of them was from Reader's Digest!  Unbelievable!  This "science textbook" is pathetic 
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 First, let me say that I've read alot of Cornwell's works including the entire Sharpe series and the other books that preceded Lords of the North. I'm a big fan of his and thinks he does outstanding work especially with military history.  Bottom line I was disappointed in this one.  There were too many things that 'just happened to happen'.     And the ending was a big letdown as well.  Perhaps my expectations have become so high that when he writes something that, I think, is not up to his high standards its a big disappointment.  In spite of that I eagerly await the next installment in this series and will buy it the first day its available!  By the way for any Sharpe fans out there I came across a Sharpe-related book (blessed by Cornwell) called Sharpe's Companion (Adkins).  Its got everything you wanted to know about the British military including uniforms, ordnance, unit sizes, pay scales, unit makeup, tactics etc.  I would recommend this for hardcore Sharpe fans.  Adkins also "replays" some of the highlights  from Sharpe's time in India 
 I bought this book because I liked the table of contents.  I assumed this book would present concrete, actionable specifics on the subjects presented in the table of contents.  I was disappointed.  Under information planning, this book only tells you that you should do it.  Gee, thanks.  Under estimating and scheduling - you should estimate future project resources and you should request new resources and fund innovation.  Oh, boy.  Yippee.  This book is an exercise in stating the blatantly obvious.  I expected to see information on the nuts and bolts of producing technical documentation...I expected to see examples of budgets, examples of ways to create efficient systems for document production using single-sourcing, and to see examples of specific, important techniques for planning a document production process that allows for easy translation, revision, re-usability and transfer to different mediums.  I expected to get a reference that would become well-worn on my desk.  This book is as far from such a tome as it could possibly get while still being written in the English language.  I want to improve the efficiency of my documentation projects.  I'd like to know about technologies (XML?, VBA?) that might help me with separating content from layout and improving reusability.  Is that here?  Nope.  But you do get way too much talk about how you should acquire good tools that support your business goals.  There is nothing about what those tools should be or what specifically would make them good.  One page tells you the difference between a "traditional" project and an "agile" project...things like:  An agile project "responds to change" and has "minimal process documentation"  as well as "reduced development schedules".  That's nice.  Who cares?  Implementing a Topic Architecture is the only section that even makes a move in the direction of specific, concrete, useful material.  But even it leaves you thinking, "Well, duh...yathink?"  To sum up, this book tells you all the obvious things you ought to do...but that's it.  It doesn't have anything to say about HOW you would actually do those things.  I doubt the author has the foggiest idea how because I doubt she has a single hard skill to speak of.  She definitely didn't write about any 
 I bought this book because all the positive reviews convinced me that it might be worth reading. My hunch wasted more than a few hours of my life.   The book uses the Harry Potter series as a springboard to discuss various philosophical problems. After finishing the book, though, I can't say that I've gained any deeper understanding of philosophy, or Harry Potter, whatsoever.   Take, for instance, ethics. One writer essentially summarizes one aspect the naturalist view (if God doesn't exist, then morality doesn't either) and the Christian view (God does exist, and morality is indispensable). The end. To say that the editors skim the surface with this work is akin to saying that Plato liked to think about stuff.   Next, consider the editor's treatment of courage. Says the writer: readers, you can build up courage by preparation. No really, hear me out on this! Know that if you fail there will be consequences. Friends can give you support too. Says the reader: oh my god. I can't believe I just used my hard-earned cash on this. This will be the most expensive toilet paper I've ever purchased.   Perhaps I was expecting too much. Perhaps I was wrong for being disappointed at receiving a collection of infuriatingly childish essays vaguely connecting Harry Potter to philosophy with all the grace of a floundering fish washed up onto the shore.  Perhaps I was wrong. But I seriously doubt it. If you're expecting what I was from this book--some food for thought--look elsewhere. It does not provoke thought, nor does it provide entertainment.  In this book's stead, I recommend the enlightening "Looking for God in Harry Potter" by John Granger. I am hardly religious but the truth is the Potter series is religious in tone, very much so in fact. Granger contends that the Potter series is classically symmetrical and alchemical in form. He provides insights rather than platitudes. Sadly, editors, branding a book with Aristotle's moniker and mentioning him once every 40 pages does not make your work profound. It only underscores just how profound it is not 
 I did not like it. It is a bad story. Wolfs are not bad like in the story. Peter doesnt listen to his grandpa, so it is a bad example 
 Having lived in Japan for a long time I found this book disappointing. As another reader stated above it is written from a man's perspective and experiences in Japan.  I had a hard time relating to much of his book. Alan writes for the gaijin man in Japan. I know if a gajin woman were to repeat his journey the tale would be much different. I am sure many long-timers would agree 
 The story of a woman who said she would stop the motor of the world - and didn't 
 While I am a huge fan of Piers Anthony, I not only found this book very "put down-able" but offensive.  Between the gratuitous sex on every page and the consumption of human body parts as aphrodesiacs, there  was very little good story.  The history parts were very good and read  well, but the story part of the book was a definite turn-off for me and  several of my friends.  I'd stick to the other Anthony series for better  entertainment 
 I love Daniel Stell books but this one was horible.I have to admit I didn't finsh it but I got tired of how her husband treated her and she did nothing about it.But from what I've read from other readers I didn't miss much by not finshing it 
 I honestly do not like cheat devices, but since Wild Arms 4 came out, it actually now has a use. Let me explain...  Unfortunately, thanks to an programming on the part of Xseed Puplishing (the company that translated Wild Arms 4) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device, or a similar device like a Gameshark. Since this is the cheapest of all said devices, if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game, you'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this.  If it wasn't for this reason, I wouldn't even be interested in this product. 
 How to take seriously a comparatively recent book that first claims that all films are documentaries and than goes on to explain how there are various kinds of documentaries (some of which are obviously not documentaries at all)? Naturally, the terminology in film studies is not very well systematized, but there is no need to forget the work done in this field so far - this contemporary book, in a sense, seems to have been written immediately after classical (but somewhat dated)  writings of John Grierson and Andre Bazin! A great deal of Grierson's and Bazin's writing is still interesting, much of it still holds water, but this is a diluted and clumsily combined version of their respective approaches. "Reality" is a dangerous concept if we don't explain or define it, so is "realism" and of course, in this book particularly, so is the "documentary".  After the start that confuses the issues, some lucid observations and potentially explanatory examples lead nowhere and promote confusion. It's a pity 
 I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!     
 For all the critical acclaim that Niall Ferguson's Colossus received, including being favorably reviewed on NPR and earning him a guest spot on the TV show Uncommon Knowledge, you would think that he is really on to something.   Sadly Colossus is just another reminder that if you use enough partially relevant data and ignore enough essential facts you can draw just about any conclusion.  Ferguson's suggestions that an American empire is desirable state of affairs is both pathetic and, fortunately, archaic.  The book does have its high points.  Ferguson is novel because he is one of the few supporters of an aggressive American foreign policy that will admit that we are an empire, or, as he puts it, an "empire in denial."  Furthermore, much of his reading of the history of American foreign policy is well researched and interesting.  But his argument wholly falls apart in Chapter 4, Splendid Multilateralism, when he chooses to make his case in support of the US invasion of Iraq by citing the infamous Weapons of Mass Destruction.  After such absurd statements it becomes hard to take him seriously as a scholar or even an honest man; instead Ferguson occupies a distinguished position with Judith Miller as the one of the last people on the planet to believe such hoary lies.  Ultimately, what is really offensive about this book is the suggestion that a kinder, gentler empire is even possible.  The first few chapters are full of Ferguson whining about why the United States chose to set up or support various dictators, including the monstrous Agosto Pinochet in Chile.  On this point as well it is hard to take Ferguson seriously as he blithely ignores of the powerful business interests that drive American foreign policy.  Such interpretations of history, in a less educated man, would be naive; here they are disingenuous.  Fortunately, with both contemporary global political attitudes and the arrival of this latest wave of globalization with its resultant rapid economic growth in many developing nations, this patronizing attitude towards "subject" peoples is merely laughable.    The bright side of this book is Ferguson's analysis of the current state of popular American attitudes towards empire, that we haven't the stomach for it, and that empires themselves are becoming ideologically indefensible.  In this, Ferguson is not only right, but for once we Americans can be somewhat vindicated on a worldwide level.  As the anti-war movement in this country shows, Americans not only continue the proud tradition of conscientious anti-imperialism, if only on a small scale, but that even that can make empires unmanageable.  It's nice when even those who slavishly fetishize the power of the American Empire, like Ferguson, notice 
 I got this pitcher about 5 months ago and sure enough I ran into the same leaking problems like everyone else. I should have checked    up on this pitcher before the purchase from Target. Good thing my mom bought it and not me 
 I expected a lot more from this book, especially since its subject seemed so topical to our modern consumerist society.  Alas, without even getting through the first chapter, I already found myself struggling to continue.  It's not that the author is so smug in his tone, or that he uses facile arguments to support his thesis.  It is that the book masquerades as being thoughtful and inspired, rather than the one-sided, prescriptive, and completely unrealistic rant that it is.  To actually recommend that we quit our jobs and let life provide for us is one of the most ridiculous suggestions that I have heard, and I feel the author is not only insincere in making this statement, but deceptive in not admitting it to be anything other than fanciful.  The cute chapter titles and organization based on time of day are contrived and the author seems to grasp for things to say just to fit this artificial organization.  Being idle is one thing if it is meaningful; reading filler is not something I or many people enjoy, especially if it is humorless and insipid.  There are many much better books to inspire one to free oneself from the daily tedium of work, such as Alain de Botton's "How Proust Can Change Your Life" or Robert Pirsig's "Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance."  If you really have nothing better to do with your time, maybe give this book a shot, but it is doubtful you can manage more than a chapter at a time, and even then wonder whether it is worth it to continue.  What a waste and shame 
 These boots look good on the first wear.  I bought the black patent boots and after one, not so wild night, they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material.  If you need boots for one night, for that perfect outfit, these will suffice. 
 I am a GIS student who's also gone through most of a computer science degree and so I know Visual Basic and lots of other kinds of programming, but going through this book is one of the more tedious and confusing things I've done. Granted, MapObjects is a fairly large library and object set, but the author makes it worse in several ways. First, he deliberately gives you code in some places that doesn't work, only to correct it later on. This may be an admirable attempt to get you to learn it and think it through, but it just doesn't work - it's too large a set of objects and methods to keep track of, so trying to keep track of things which aren't even supposed to work makes it worse. Furthermore, in several places he does this, he changes some parts of the code, but forgets to change other parts that the original changes make neccessary to change, and one is left with a confusing mish-mash of partially edited code that doesn't look like the pictures in the book and doesn't always work. It is almost as if the author himself can't keep track of what's going on. Finally, his explanatory method of writing down large chunks of code with *short* descriptions afterwards doesn't really help. It would have been much better if he explained each component one-by-one, possibly even isolating them from other components where possible, and also made the code as simple as possible *without* having the deliberate errors. When you're learning something as complicated as this, the smaller the chunks, the better - and it's really nice to have code that works and runs right from the start so you can really see how it works (instead of not being able to see how it works due to deliberate errors) 
 Mr. Frazier gives a pretty good litany of historical facts, but his haphazard presentation leaves one to wonder whether he was totally coherent during his two years on the plains.  His style is reminiscent of someone who never quite grasped the finer points of high school English composition, and the entire description of his travels seems to reflect someone who is permanently mired in a 1960's-era drug trip.  I grew up in northwestern Nebraska and am intimately familiar with the region and its history, so I expected a more thorough, considered discussion in this book.  Boy, was I disappointed 
 TV tuner card was sent and received as stated by the seller.  The TV card however did not work on our laptop (IBM Thinkpad A41p) but worked just fine in a laptop of a different manufacturer.  Had to use AVerMedia website to get resolution of problem but gave up when we realized the process was going to take forever.  Sold it to person who got it to work on their laptop and we just bought a LCD TV 
 Flayderman's has not revised gun values since 2001.  They put a date on the reverse of the fly page of 2004, but it just a re-print of the one compiled in 2000 and printed in 2001.  I hope others are not fooled like I was thinking they are getting an updated book.  I feel I wasted my money.  Gun values have changed too much in the last few years, and I find this book worthless 
 I really enjoyed FORTY WORDS FOR SORROW, my first exposure to Giles Blunt, and have looked forward to his subsequent work.  However, this novel more closely resembles Delicate Storm the Forty Words.  Moments of pleasure, pages of boredom, this novel is an uneven disappointment for readers of Forty Words. Where  John Cardinal was at his best struggling with his moral delimmas in Forty Words, he has become flat, stilted, and predictable in Blackfly Season.  The dialouge between Delorme and Cardinal has taken a turn for the obvious, and no longer resembles the tension inhernet in Forty Words.  The novel started out well enough, holding my attention through the first 100 pages or so, but I quickly found myself racing to get to the end.  The climax to the central plot was wildly unrealistic, as if conjured up by the very Santeria Gods Cardinal and company where battling against.  I won't give away any story elements, but readers of Forty Words beware - Blackfly Season will not be remembered for much more than those annoying flys 
 Major themes in Missing May will be of concern to some parents, yet are not easy to discern from the book's summaries. The characterizations are good. There are moments that might help a reader be more sympathetic towards people who look or act in a way that seems odd to them.   However, in the spiritual realm, there is much to entice readers into the "Church" of Spirituality, the occult, seeking answers with mediums and more. This bundle of confusion is all wrapped in a Newbery award winner which will be on every required reading list throughout the land.   There are parents who would not wish their children to have these issues painted in a positive light, or would like to discuss these things with their children in the light of their own values, but who do not have a clue about the content judging from the book summary. The Newbery award will make it even more likely that unsuspecting parents will have their children read this book, unaware of any conflict with their beliefs.    
 This refers to the 2nd edition, 6th printing.  I had the 2nd edition, 3rd printing of this book from our library and was quite happy with it -- see the other reviews about the quality of the content.  So I decided to buy it... however what I received was the 2nd edition, 6th printing, for which the term "printing" is not quite appropriate. It looks like if you had run the 3rd printing through a scanner and then printed it using your favourite bubble jet printer. What was gray in the 3rd printing appears as black, there are stripes in black areas, and thin lines in the drawings tend to disappear. Moreover, all the text characters have black speckles around it and white speckles inside the characters. This is not only at some pages, but throughout the entire book.  So if you intend to buy it, have a look at the figure on page 1, and judge for yourself if you are happy with the printing 
 I haven't done this in awhile, but I don't think I could review this piece any better than the other reviews I've read about it. It's pretty average, however filled with nice bits of knowledge. They didn't seem well-researched in some areas. Here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other "critics" that I agree with...  "they go into lengthy history lessons about the origins of the characters when two sentences...would be enough." - John Gallant  "Biased against superheros(sic)" - Christopher Ritter  "I found this book to be tedious, lacking in charm, badly researched and wildy inaccurate in some areas." - C.P. Halliday  "I picked up this book." - Lawrance M. Bernabo  "Their belief seems to be that Donald Duck was the best comic book ever..." - M.G. Bloedorn  "Pretty boring." - BernardZ  "...a black hole is hypothesized, lending a faint respectability to the premise behind Green Lantern's abilities." - Peter Vinton Jr.  "...this book will not satisfy full on fans..." - James N. Simpson <---gave it five stars.  "a chance to laugh about the heroes I still love and that mean so much to me." - Reviewer  "Man, there's a whole 200 pages of this pooh-poohing, cranky-old-maid kind of stuff!" - Mark Alfred  "They were even putting words into C. Darwin's mouth." - Aaron Spriggs  "Mildly entertaining but not great" - Reviewer  "When the man (Dean Koontz in this case) writing the introduction says he doesn't read comics, I began to get worried." - Ivan A. Wolfe  "I agree with an earlier poster." - Reviewer  "Almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible." Plastic Larry  "the authors give us a more plausible (given what we know now) origin for the Hulk, involving steroids and fluorescent gene modification." - J. Draper Carlson  "this book is not mean spirited or nasty." Reviewer  "Superman's powers break the laws of science. Ooh. Stop the presses." - [...]  "interesting." - Rick Hunter  "The Science of Superheroes," - Reviewer 
 I've always admired Norman Cantor as a historian.  However, this book is terrible.  It is scattered--I could never tell what was coming next or how ideas fit together.  It is repetitious--giving the same general fact or opinion over and over again, as if the author couldn't remember what he'd already said or had no idea of organization.  It is vague--rarely does he get into the specific details we know of Gaunt's life that would give us a true flavor of the times.  The all too brief section on Gaunt's registers was one of the few interesting sections of the book.  A waste of my time and money 
 I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, and while I wasn't expecting the best quality in the world (because of the price), I was still a little disappointed. The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges. (Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies. 
 This book confirms something which should have been obvious to most people years and years ago: Sontag's work has always been all about style.  This is a woman who has modeled her life and work on the image of the Central European intellectual.  Her productions are one long affectation of Mitteleuropa world-weariness.  Take a look at her "Elegy for Europe".  She praises the "ethical seriousness" of European intellectual life, but the only thing of substance she's ever taken away from 20th-century European intellectuals is their political nihilism.  In that context, there is nothing surprising about her inhumane ramblings on the "courage" of Mohammed Atta & Co., just a couple of days after the worst terrorist attack in history, or her denunciation of the "disconnect" between the American reaction to the events and their true significance.  The *real* disconnect, and the source of all of the pretentious buffoonery we've had to put up with for so long, is Sontag's own alienation from her country.  It is in times like these that we find ourselves wishing that Susan Sontag had never returned from her Parisian garret 
 The shiny chrome handle bars cannot be tightened properly. The result is a constant misalignment, and a consistent loosening of the front wheel assembly.  "Why did my bike break into two pieces, daddy?" wondered my three year old as I tried picking-up the bike by the handle bar 
 The Russian nuclear powered, missile carrying (SSBN) submarine K-219 was about 15 years old when it nearly triggered either WWIII or a 2nd Chernobyl.  In 1986, with Chernobyl still in minds of the public, and the Reagan/Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik imminent, the navies of both sides of the cold war sail SSBN's off each other's shore.  Floating platforms loaded with numerous missiles - some with multiple warheads - these subs are almost as dangerous to their crews as they are to the enemy.  In the case of K-219, the balance shifted firmly against the crew.  Poor design, construction and shipyard maintenance had prematurely aged the sub launched only a few years earlier than the first 688-class American subs.  Near Bermuda, K-219 was nearly sunk by a missile explosion caused by leaking seawater.  With one tube already deactivated because of seawater problems on a prior cruise, this was not a new problem.  In this case however, the explosion nearly sinks the then submerged boat, then floods it with toxic and corrosive gas.  Problems increase when the ships two reactors suffer a loss-of-coolant accident and nearly meltdown.  Echoing the experience of K-19, some brave crewmen sacrifice themselves to shut the reactors down.  Complications ensue when superiors in Moscow order the crew (once safely evacuated to a nearby freighter) to re-board the poisoned ship.  An American sub with a maverick commander adds to the danger when he runs his ship too near the stricken sub, apparently ordered to keep K-219 from being recovered.  Eventually, the ship will sink, and Captain Britanov will have to return home and answer to his superiors for the loss of the sub.  The loss of K-219 is a fascinating story, but unfortunately this book doesn't do it justice.  The cause of the book's numerous flaws is the author's determination to write it as if it were a novel, in which the facts, if not complete, are still single-minded.  That is, despite an extensive bibliography, there's only one version of the account.  Rather than document possible disputes over what happened, or why people act the way they did, "Hostile waters" offers a single, linear perspective, one with easily identifiable heroes and villains (the political officer is singled out for unpopularity even before he grabs the first lifeboat off K-219 - since he does nothing throughout the story he's an easy target).  This is not only a monumental cheat, but also robs the reader of critical facts - such as what really caused the ship to sink as it did; also the circumstances surrounding the apparently feckless captain of the American sub, and whether any blame should attach to Britanov for not knowing of the leaking missile tube or the painful domestic situation of the officer directly responsible for monitoring it.  "Hostile Waters" reads like a novel - a very unrealistic one 
 Truthfully, I wouldn't even give it a 1 star! This stuff ain't true about us new breed of Filipinos. This book is a bit outdated. Don't even read it!  Just for example about the opening of present issue. It may be true to some but not all of us. And so does any other country. This is not a very helpful book. 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 I'm a 33 yr old woman with a strong grip. I bought this to pick up chip wrappers and plastic bags that blow into my yard, icky stuff I just don't want to touch with my bare hands. It does work for that, but the grip is quite hard to squeeze and it is difficult to keep the jaws closed. Someone who has a weak grip would have a problem using this and managing it effectively. It is light in weight, as described,but it is not as effective as other models I have seen  
 The video certainly has potential, however as someone that has been working out for over 10 years this tape is WAAY too easy. I barely feel a burn while doing the ab workouts, and they are entirely too short. Perhaps if they were three times as long and did all four back to back it would be a worthwhile workout. But I have much better ab tapes that kick my butt with 5 minute segment(notably The Firm abs and Tamilee Webb ab tapes). If you are an advanced exerciser I say pass on this one 
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
 Gerd Ludemann writes, "historical research shows with definite clarity that Jesus was not raised from the dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax", (190). A summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support.  Three streams of thought permeate "The Resurrection of Christ": gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish, invent, or explain away; Peter and Paul experienced hallucination and "vision" experiences proceeding from self-deception; belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific. Each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions, or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter-Christian polemic.   In his chapter "Translation and analysis of the Early Christian texts on the Resurrection", Ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles "purpose and tradition reworked" (re. Gospel writers), and "historical elements". In the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic, or perhaps (he intimates) to cover up some element of embarrassment. For example, Ludemann asserts that we may conclude that Joseph of Arimathea was a member of the Jewish Council (which condemned Jesus), but that Mark (earliest gospel) "likely" invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of God and had become a disciple of Jesus. But Ludemann needs to discredit such notions, for all four gospel writers record Joseph as the rich council member that buried Jesus in his own tomb. Ludemann's case will be much weaker if Jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances. Ludemann gets carried away with himself when he, in tabloid fashion, suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to "disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial" of Jesus. This is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze. Ludemann goes so far as to accuse Matthew, Mark and Luke of being anti-Jewish! (Refer to the ridiculous Appendix 3).  Is Christianity a "history of self deception"? Ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of hallucination; for the burden is on Ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of Jesus available in the New Testament. That any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid. Ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence. 1 Corinthians 15 is the New Testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of Jesus' multiple appearances. Even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text (vs. 3-5) to the early 30's AD. The discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection, three physical events. Also, the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of Jesus eating and offering his body for examination, as well as being hugged! Ludemann though, convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above, and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions, introduces hallucination. What accounts for these hallucinations? "Peter's vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning" (165). Paul's "event had a character of light and, like the vision of John, happened in the spirit, i.e., in ecstasy" (47). But Paul does not report "I was in the Spirit" as John does (see Revelation 1). John is deliberately conveying a non-physical experience. Paul is not. When Paul does have opportunity to convey an actual "in the spirit" experience, he does so in terms appropriate to that experience (2 Corinthians 12:2). So we have record of Paul's ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual. Ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages "modern depth psychology" to explain Paul's conversion from zealous persecutor of Christians to "Apostle-in-Chief of a new program of salvation" (170-171). So, we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of Paul's subconscious state, than from the widely accepted facts of Jesus death, burial, empty tomb and appearances!   Ludemann's examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural. Historians look for the best explanation of the evidence. Yet Ludemann writes, "Who decides at what point of historical study a `theological explanation' ought to begin" (201). This is rife with misunderstanding. One need only confirm that an event occurred in history, regardless of theological implications.  Also, simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism (thus supernaturalism) is an entirely logical proposition. Yet Ludemann quotes another author, "[the disciples] believed in phantoms; ... imagined that they were surrounded by miracles; ... took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time." (175). This ignores the New Testament textual evidence that initially Jesus' disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened, and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works. Even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle!   Ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with Paul that if there is no resurrection, we should abandon Christianity. Sadly, he reaches the wrong conclusion. Self deluded by a proliferation of "one can imagine", "seems to indicate", "likely enough", and "one thus suspects" reasoning, Ludemann boasts "accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer Easter vision". (210). May the reader decide otherwise 
 This compilation is far inferior to the awesome collection in the album "Best of 007 Bond: James Bond" 40th Anniversary Edition, which on one single CD has 22 songs, including all the beloved theme songs we grew up (and old) with.  That set, also available here on Amazon, costs less than half of this POS here, which is expensive and filled with crappy songs.  Get the other album 
 I got this on an Amazon special for $34.79. For the money the features seemed very competitive. The product description says "fits 9 to 13 inch arms" My arm measures exactly 13 inches. There is a "OK" mark on arm cuff which states "Index must be in Ok range". My 13 inch arm falls 2 1/4 inches into the "Select Larger Cuff" range.

 This book kind of sucked. I was sure I was going to like it but it failed to live up to some of the comments that others have said about it. I never really got into the story and the characters weren't at all people you would want to meet let alone read about. Save your money and buy a good book 
 While this book does contain good information, it's presented in a way I couldn't get past. In an attempt to read like the owner's manual for a machine, like a car or a stereo system, the book consistently refers to the baby as "the model". It was obviously meant to be cute but in my opinion it fails in that respect. I'm very much turned off by referring to babies in the same way you would refer to your washing machine. My baby is a PERSON, not a THING. To its credit, the book does explain how each baby is unique, but it does so by pointing out that "some models do this" and "some models do that." Again, I'm turned off by referring to the baby as a "model" 
 i have read 5 graham greene books and this is by far the lamest of them. this was conceived of first as a hollywood movie, and it shows. the book is not much more that a silly, corny thriller (just what hollywood orders over and over and over). there is very little character development involved, & the the sense of place (vienna after world war ii) could have been given much greater depth, as well. this is simply a plot being rushed onto the big screen ( a half-baked, lame plot, at that) to make some cash. pass this one by. 
 Georgescu-Roegen's intentions are laudable, as are many of his proposals. The thermodynamic basis of this work, unfortunately, is unsupportable. This is a pity, as it has left his critique of capitalism open to dismissal, and has contributed to a generation of obfuscation in social and environmental theory.  The problem, simply put, is this: while it sounds convincing to most lay-people (and even many physicists, chemists and engineers) to equate thermodynamic entropy with "disorder", this is based on a meaningless misinterpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics simply states that energy tends to disperse, if it is not hindered from doing so. It says nothing about "orderliness", and nothing about availability of matter.  Entropy is an extensive property of thermodynamic systems. It is not a property of energy, and certainly not of matter. It is nonsensical to speak of "high- or low-entropy" energy. It is even more nonsensical to speak of "high- or low-entropy" matter. Better to speak of energy quality ("the sun provides us with high-quality energy, and low-quality energy is re-radiated back into space"). Entropy is used to measure the "concentration" (I use this term for illustration only) and hence the usefulness or availability to us of energy, within a given system of matter and energy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us nothing about the tendency of matter to become more or less useful or available to us. There is no thermodynamic basis for reading inevitable decay onto physical, biological or social systems.  Dr. Frank L. Lambert, Professor Emeritus (Chemistry) of Occidental College, Los Angeles, has carried out extensive work over the past few years to demythologise the popular (and, all too frequently, specialist) misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics. For anyone contemplating reading "The entropy law and the economic process", I would strongly advise that you first look at Lambert's website: http://www.entropysite.com. He goes through this in detail in multiple format aimed at a range of audiences from lay-person to scientist and engineer.  This review is not intended to be disparaging, towards either Georgescu-Roegen, or others who share the common misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics. The problem is deeply entrenched and it will be a long time before the myths around entropy and the second law are dispelled. This is a start 
 This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
 South Beach helped me the most.  The Atkins books give a tremendous amount of information.  Dr. Phil provides good insights.  Stick with any of these and you can't go wrong 
 Funny that a book about execution doesn't get it accomplish. The authors have a lot of experience and I am sure are good at leading and executing. However, the book does not get to the point. The authors ramble about their managing experience and almost 300 pages to transmit few ideas 
 I always find it humorous when I read reviews for great classics (The Lord of the Flies, The Grapes of Wrath, etc..) written by students required to read them for class, and they write a review referring to it as "the worst novel ever written", "boring", etc...  Yet I picked up and read Ironweed, a Pulitizer Prize winning novel as well as being listed on the Top 100 Books List, and this book just didn't work for me.   Where can I start: the dialogue is bad, the characters are overwrought caricatures...I kept getting the image of a Hobo Clown walking around with one shoe on and wearing a tattered checkerboard jacket. As Kennedy goes to great lengths to write about drunkeness and self-wallowing, I kept saying to myself "Let's get on with it!"       To convey a sense of greater tragedy, I felt Kennedy was manipulative, throwing out past tragedies and strange deaths of almost every person that the main character, Francis Phelan, happened to remember.      I kept having flashbacks to High School English class as I read this book...it's that pedestrian.   Think I'm being too harsh. Check out this little snippet from the book:   "He walked with an empty soul toward the north star, magnetized by an impulse to redirect his destiny."  And here's some dialogue:  "It'd choke me." "It won't choke you. You'll be glad for it." "I'm not a phony." "I'm not a phony either." "You're not, et?"            I actually have to agree with some of the reviewers who wrote "I learned nothing and came away with nothing."  When I read On the Road by Kerouac I kept thinking "I should have read this when I was 18" but I never felt the book was poorly written.    For a novel describing the same time period and written in the same vein, yet a hundred time more effective, read The Postman Always Rings Twice by Cain.  
 I hated her column in Shape but I was having a fat moment and decided to read her book anyway and man, oh, man, it blew. What a whiny drama queen!  All she does is blame and refuse to take any responsibility for the fact that her weight loss project sh^t the bed becasue she has no control over her eating. Wah. Po' Coutney. Have another Jumbo muffin 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 How would you feel if you invested in Google and they decided to dedicate 1% of their resources(employees, capital, assets, and time) to the community?  You'd be pissed.  Their stock price would probably drop at least 1% every year due to wasting resources on activities that are outside their core competencies.  This is why the government pays 100.00 for a hammer - they don't know how to make them themselves.  Imagine 4,989 google employees spending 3 days (1% of their yearly effort at work) driving corn oil fueled buses to New Orleans to pull people out of dwellings that been flooded with toxic waste.  Even better lets send them to Irag to count votes.  Maybe a few will get decapitated for their kindness.  In either case their healthcare costs would rise sending the stock price down a little more.  By the way which community should we help first?  Do we take a poll?  Is it based on demographics, need, or should we pick a community out of a hat.  And what about the employees?  Maybe they don't want to help anybody?  Is this in their job description?  Adam Smith and Alexander Hamilton would have to have a duel just to figure out who gets to kick the authors ass first.  
 Let me say at the start, I'm a big fan of Jayne Ann Krentz. I read all her books, under all her pseudonyms, and love 99.9% of her work.  From Krentz, I usually expect quirky heroines and endearing heros. Though they may spar at first, it's usually a fair give and take between the two, and a genuine affection quickly builds. It would seem the characters bring out the best in each other, and we love it when they're together. I usually smile a lot when I read a Krentz book, and I miss the characters when I finish.  Sweet Fortune must have been written by Krentz's evil twin. There is nothing endearing about "Hatch", our business-driven hero with no sense of humor and no warmth. And there are no witty verbal exchanges between the two. Our heroine, "Jessie", endures put-down after put-down without ever coming out on top, and seems to apologize on nearly every page. Hatch's character is always right, and unpleasantly smug. When Jessie inquires about his previous marriage, Hatch "puts up" with her questioning in a terribly condescending manner, because, we're led to believe, she is out-of-line in asking. And -- oh no! -- she apologizes for bringing it up. These are two people sleeping together, contemplating engagement, and he's behaving as if it's rude for her to ask if he had been married before. This is not a dark, brooding Duke from the Regency period that you might love to hate in the first few chapters. No, this is just a 20th/21st century know-it-all jerk that anyone with a shred of self-respect and an ounce of self-esteem would avoid.  I love a good dominant male in a romance novel... but the relationship in Sweet Fortune made me cringe. It was actually physically unpleasant to read this book.  Pick another Krentz book, that's my suggestion 
 Before reviewing the latest Paul Auster novel, I'd like to point out a few things: I am a huge Auster fan. First, I saw Smoke, the movie, and even though I hate cigarretes, I found it simply beautiful. After that, I read The New York Trilogy and The music of chance. It's hard to  describe these novels. While reading them, I felt like they were burning my hands, but I couldn't stop reading them. Late at night, when I could barely see, I kept telling to myself, one more chapter, another chapter, just a few more pages. Then I realized that the end was close, so finished them in less then two days. The music of chance was so hypnotic, that even if I had to walk some where, I would read while I was walking. That's the spell that these two novels pulled on me.   Now, I few years later, I went full circle. I read every single novel Auster wrote, so you can consider me a PaulAusterologist. Although I read a lot, Auster is the only author, prolific author (more than 7 novels) of which I read his whole work (novels) What did I found in this journey? He is very reiterative, very very. Most of his characters are some how in the writing business, if not writers. As he is. They went to Columbia. As he did. They speak french. As he does. They are avid readers. As he is. Of course that this happens with many writers, but this is maybe too much. Also, you always find the idea that little events, little decisions we make, can reshape our life in a blink. Last but not least, his characters are always commited to major tasks. Things that only they understand, but some how will be very important. Things that for unknown reasons, they must do. This is Paul Auster's world. And he is running out of ideas.  What about Travels in the scriptorium? Well, basically Auster is being visited by his characters. They are angry, yet they care for him. The question is, after he did so many things to them, sent them to so many dangerous places, made them do so many twisted things, what do they feel about him, what would they do to him if they have a chance? That's a question many writers ask themselves, but turning it in to a novel? I don't know... looks lazy to me, specially after producing so many similar pieces lately.  Finally, Auster is human as we are. That means that he is obsessed and haunted by certain questions just as we are. These questions will be after us our whole life, yes, but if you are a writer, you must try to write something new and not the same novel over and over.   A few years ago, I saw a García Márquez interview. He said that after One hundred years of solitude, that kind of writing, the themes, the structure, the universe and the type of characters, were so deep in him, that he could have written the same book, slightly changed, over and over for many years. But he didn't. Instead, he stopped writing. He took a break. He took many years. And then, only then, when he finally got rid of the One hundred years of solitude universe, he produced a different book, completely fresh. I think that Auster should do the same 
 On avrage, I read fast.  I read a copy of the edition that was 264 pages.  Normanly that would take me 2 days.  This boring book took me about a week.  From the begining, this book was dull and hard to understand.  I would NOT recomend this book to anyone who doesn't history fiction.  It had some crude parts, as well 
 Half paean to old-time radio, half murder mystery, this overly melodramatic WWII-era set novel lurches along for far too long before petering out, exhausted with itself. I've enjoyed Dunning's "Bookman" series, and I like historically set mysteries, so picking this up seemed like a no-brainer. But Dunning overextends himself with this one. The story revolves around Jack Dulaney, a down-and-out racetrack horse-walker who gets in a fight that lands him in jail. His buddy helps to spring him from a work gang, but is then killed. This is the catalyst for Jack's incredibly complicated search for the killer and reason behind the murder. The trail leads him to a New Jersey beach town and the radio station where his buddy used to work as an actor. There, further disappearances and deaths are revealed, including that of Carnahan, the father of the woman he pined for years before. As it happens, the woman is also in town, working as a nightclub singer under an assumed name. Jack manages to get work at the station as a writer, allowing him to poke around and try to get to the bottom of everything (not to mention rekindle his old flame).   Here is where the book starts to have real problems. Namely, all the detail about old-time radio production is far more fascinating than the murders. I'm not particularly (nor are most readers likely to be) interested in how dramatic radio shows were put together back in the '30s and '40s, but Dunning makes the station come alive and does a fascinating job of detailing the inner workings. From the scripting, to the management, the actors, the sound effects, it's all very well dramatized. So much so, in fact, that it's hard for the reader to care very much about the deaths of some characters met only very briefly or in flashbacks. The station's attempt to create original dramatic programming that pushed the limits of what was considered acceptable material--such as a scripted serial about black Americans, an anti-war prison camp series, and soforth--ends up being much more interesting. Unfortunately, the story eventually leaves the radio setting (via a lame piece of misdirection lifted from Hamlet) to dive into the world of German spies in America, the Irish Republic Army, and all manner of melodrama.  The melodrama is enhanced by a certain thinness to the characters. The protagonist is an especially poorly drawn hero figure with altogether too keen a resemblance to the hero of Dunning's "Bookman" series. He's one of those all-purpose strong, capable men. Street-fighting? No problem. Writing a critically well-received Steinbeck/Dos Passosesque novel? No problem. Escaping a work gang? No problem. Master writing radio drama overnight? No problem. Expert tracking through the woods? No problem. When the hero of a story turns out to be exceptional at everything, the whole story is diluted. Beyond Jack, the cast of characters is so large that Dunning doesn't really have the time or space to develop any of them in any meaningful way. It's not generally a good thing when the villain in a mystery is a character you can barely remember being in the story. This is a pity, because there are a number of characters with potential, and the old-time radio setting is certainly well done. As a historical novel about a small group of people striving in a creative field, it works fairly well--in no small part due to the subsequent total demise of the world depicted in the book. Just don't expect to pick this up and find yourself immersed in a thriller. 
 This book is falsified and exaggerated.  The press attempted to frighten the public at the time this was published.  The Voodoo's also were trying to scare "outsiders" who criticized them away with wild, false stories.  Don't believe everything you read in this book.  It's a hoax 
 I was very disappointed in this movie ~ it was a definite "sleeper" 
 As I waded through page after page after page, I began to think of a group of Hollywood scriptwriters sitting around a table.  Each is trying to top the other by dreaming up more outlandish and depressing situations for his/her characters.    "A Fine Balance" is totally depressing, one tragedy after another all the way to the last page (601).  By the end of the book, I was convinced I was reading the screenwriters' list crammed into a novel. 
 I got this book in hopes that it would tell me something about diet and arthritis.  It is mostly about eliminating things from your diet, in order to isolate food alergies.  In general, I was unimpressed with this book.  Other than advising that you be conscious of food alergies, it is little more than advice on healthy diet.  You can get that anywhere without paying $20.  "Eat your fruits and veggies."  There.  You've read the book 
 This is a good book, but most are under the impression that Einstein actually CREATED the content of the book.  Einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest German and Italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory.  For instance, e=mc^2 was not created by Einstein, as so many people people. An Italian physicist came up with it. If you don't believe me check any encyclopedia.  Einstein suceeded in taking everyone's work and compiling it. This was helpful to the world of physics.  Unfortunately, this stuff is outdated, and Autodynamics has disproven many things that Einstein says in this book. When it came out it was already outdated. This was published in the 60s. Autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s (45 I believe). If this was published in the 20s or even the 30s, it would have been a good book 
 I attempted to use this cable with the Griffin iMic to connect my turntable directly to my G5 iMac and import some of my old vinyl LPs.  However, this setup was not able to produce anything close to satisfactory recordings, despite tweaking the settings in the Finyl Vinyl software provided with the iMic and the Mac's Sound control panel.  The recorded signal was very weak, even with input gains maxed out, and even worse there was an intolerable amount of white noise (sound like rushing air) in the recording.  The signal coming out of the turntable is simply way too weak to provide a decent signal for recording without a preamplifer in the setup.  I connected the turntable to my old stereo receiver, and plugged the iMic into one of the receiver's tape recorder outputs,  and voila--lots of signal strength and very clean recordings, no white noise whatsover.  Direct connection of the turntable to the computer would have been more convenient, but the results are not satisfactory to even a casual listener, (such as myself).  I'm 30 bucks poorer, but wiser for the experience 
 The author wrote a book on sexuality, while considerably lacking knowledge about women and female sexuality 
 I would love to read a neutral book on Barry Bonds, I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate one-sided ones as well. The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge (whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).  The book covers a wide variety of topics, some are puzzeling. While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an exotic dancer. I was pretty upset to read that, I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that.  This book came out right after (or because of) Game of Shadows. This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information, guess that backfired Pearlman. In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well.  The book uses many annoymous sources (there is a reference sheet in the back, most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources), so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay.  The book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people, they like to find good stories. That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it. Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now. Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that.  So once again, the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground. This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires, ran into the stands to attack people, slept with hookers, drank all the time, was mean to Lou Gherig, etc.  While that may be true it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste, just like this 
 In the past, I used to distance myself from certain rock genres because of a bad first experience. I'd be introduced to band, not like it, and claim the entire genre as being 'not for me'. The Forecast, however, has changed how I feel. I, personally, love a heartfelt emo record just as much as the next guy, but only because I was introduced to Jimmy Eat World and Spitalfield a couple of years back. Those bands allowed me to embrace the entire genre as a whole, and expand my emo knowledge. Imagine though, if you will, that I was new to emo. You, in theory, hand me a copy of "late night conversations" and tell me to listen. Of course, I hate it, and lose any interest I may have had in the genre. To make a long story short, the only good that came out of 'late night conversations' (an underproduced, generic, stale piece of s**t) was the revelation that came post-listen. Never judge an entire genre by the first or second band you're introduced to (from said entire genre). Not every metal band is Iron Maden. Not every punk-pop band is blink 182. Not every nu-metal band is linkin park. Not every 'emo' band is jimmy eat world. Every aspect of music has it's ups and downs, and the forecast is clearly one of the downs.  Now that I've bored you with an entire rant about nothing, I'd like you to PASS on 'late night conversations'. With your help, the forecast won't sell another record, and, in turn, leave the scene forever. Not recommended, duh 
 After reading the reviews, I rushed and bought the book. Now I'm planning to sell my copy, two days later. The book's content was inappropriate for my girls (4 and 7)  In the supernatural section, the pictures of evil spirits "boo hags" and ghosts are very frightening to young children. Also the endings of some of the stories are too sad and unresolved.  Children like to see the the "good guy" win or overcome at the end of a fairy tale. In some of these stories however, the good characters are shot and killed and nothing happens to the killer.......it's just ends like that. My oldest daughter looked sad and confused when the "cinderella" type character in the story "Mary Belle and The Mermaid" dies at the end of the story to join her dead mother.   If you have younger children (3-10) and are looking for nice books about African American girls, with a nice moral and ending try Talking Eggs by Souci, Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters by Steptoe or Flossie the Fox by McKissack instead.  For animal tales with morals try, The Lion Storyteller Book Of Animal Tales by Bob Hartman.   If your dead set on owning "Her Stories" by Hamilton, make sure you read it at the library first before purchasing.   
 What a waste of time.  This collection is mired in typical Jacobs'School academic-speak.  The language throughout is just like I remember it at IU grad school...people using big words to make themselves seem more important. Don't buy it. 1 star 
 I just finished reading this from my local library.  As much as I love Mind over Matter and Robert Klein, this really isn't a funny book.  Maybe he didn't intend it to be, but with a title like that I thought it would be a lot more entertaining instead of blandly anecdotal.  It's really just one tale after another about women he slept with, in too much detail, or girls he fantasized about- again, too much information.  And the book ends abruptly before covering any of his success in the 70's, his political comedy, etc 
 I 1st heard the single Pac's Life on the radio.  Actually, I only heard part of the song.When Ashanti is singing the hook "Pac's Life".  Then I discovered the song featured T.I..  I have nothing against these current hip-hop stars, BUT WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT PAC'S LIFE?  They have no understanding or comprehension what THUG LIFE is or means.  Dont get it twisted, i am a huge pac fan and believe he is the illest MC to bless to mic.  But this album just does not do justice for how lyrically skilled 2pac was.  If you want to buy a pac CD, make sure its no more recent than Loyal 2 Tha Game.  Thank you and i know all the real pac fans feel me out there 
 Robin Hobb knows how to write well and proved it with Assassin's Apprentice. Unfortunately, she seems to be in love with her descriptive prose and forgets mundane items such as plot, action, and likable (or at least interesting) characters. Ship of Magic suffers from an excess of flowery prose adorning a dull, meandering story containing uninteresting and mostly unlikable characters. I read a quarter of the book and stopped. Some of the (mostly glowing) reviews claim that the book gets better, but my patience dwindled to naught.  Specific things I disliked:  1. Another Hobb book in which magic but inanimate objects (the wood of the liveship) come to life only after multiple people (three generations of ship owners, in this book) die while touching the object. Can't her magic creatures have lives and personalities of their own?  2. Teens and young adults rarely learn from mistakes and repeatedly act stupid. (Maybe they are all budding politicians.)  3. The interwoven story of sea serpents from some other plane of existence is distracting because of lack of context. It probably will make sense later, but it adds nothing but confusion in the early chapters. Hobb should have started the book at the middle or near-end of the story (so we would know the importance of the serpents and the liveships) and then gone back in time.  4. The members of the main family are mostly unlikable. The only likable one has unrealistic lines: the 13-year-old acolyte talks like a 50-year-old philosopher 
 Regardless of the new extras and restored scenes, this dvd has a terrible video transfer. Horizontal edges have more edge enhancement than even the infamously bad SWEP1 Phantom Menace dvd. The overall picture is reduced to near vhs quality from the excessive ringing.  Absolutely avoid this Z-grade transfer unless you have a 13" tv or don't care at all about video quality 
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 [A] review is in essence factually devoid of temporal limits. Like eXistenZ, a review is a continuing line extending ad infinitum into eternity.    i) This book does not possess much philosophy; thus not suited      for philosophy.   ii) This book does not possess much ontology; thus not suited      for ontology.  iii) Ergo, this book is philosophically and ontologically a      muddle of asymmetries and nomologics.   iv) Moreover, as a result of this, this asymmetrical,      nomological muddle is as well mirrored in prior reviews 
 The writer used to many big words making the book very hard to understand. The book was very hard to read and impossible to understand. This book was not written for the average reader.  
 Won't the Seventies ever come to an end? Haven't women broke the glass ceiling already? The so-called engendering of modernity is an entrapped woman that can't authorize her reality blaming women that have authorized theirs. Move on already... 
 Poorly written, numerous typos, and the content wasn't much better. Most of it was irrelevant to today's military spouse. Written solely from the perspective of an insulated navy spouse, who has not had to deal with a deployment. Advice was out of date at best, and downright wrong more often than not. Seemed like a blatant advertisement for her website.  Do not buy this book, there are many many much better resources out there for the new military spouse 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
  I am really confused this book or booklet was like a bad version of a Guidepost. It wasn't all that witty and  the tales weren't that good. I bought this book figuring--It would charming and funny like the book "Marley and me".It was lame, dull, religious and preachy.I feel like I should charge Amazon a fee for wasting my time money and energies! What a RIP OFF! Below 1 star if that is viable 
  This was a very slow read.  Most members that started reading it found that it was hard to get "hooked" from the beginning.  The storyline seemed to slowly pick up towards the end of the book.  It could possibly help if "Babylon Sisters" is read first.  This is a book to check out from your local library, not for purchase 
 This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and "highly dubious" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a "massive intelligence failure" 
 I am a huge fan of Umberto Eco, and his novels (Rose and Foucault's Pendulum) and I had high hopes for this collection of essays. Eco is very satirical in these essays, sometimes too much so; the satirical and exaggerating style that is combined with very unusual translation style (ancient words that do not reach the nice rhythm of Eco's otherwise great storytellin in his other works) just got me tired of reading this book. These stories just do not entertain me this time.  Here and there I was able to find a nice story but only few. Language just doesn't get to its pace, and I also have say that majority of the stories are dated for readers in 2006. Stories about telefaxes, etc. are not relevant anymore. But also the general problem of satirical essays is that they are very much tied to the present day when they're written.  Overall, not a bad collection but nowhere near to my expectations 
 After readind this book to my son, only once, I felt very sad about what happened. Maybe because my son is only 4, his reaction to this book was a lot of sadness, rather than liking the story, or learning about Baseball. I had to spend quite a bit of time explaining to him we (mom and dad) will not die and go to heaven just yet. He was so concerned we would not be around, and started asking so many questions about DEATH. My whole purpose of buying this book was to teach him about the sport, since he is getting so interested in it, and the experience was not even close to it. It is a good book to have and read about Lou Gehrig's history, but not for a 4 year old who just wants to understand and learn more about Baseball 
 Maybe it was more like buyer beware, I was really disapointed in how superficial and extrapolated the content of the subject was. I don't consider this a an essential piece for any serious u2 fan, it  leaves you with way too much ambuguity 
 It's rare that I do not finish a book, but I had to put this one down. It was nothing like I expected it to be. The writing just was not captivating enough to make me force myself to finish it. I feel a book is only good if you can care about the characters in one way or another, and this book made me think, "So what?"  I wouldn't waste my money. Well, actually, I did. But if I was you and I hadn't bought the book yet, I wouldn't waste my money 
 I saw India Hicks on Larry King, so I got this book. Unfortunately, her decorating and style sense is a lot more dull than her personal life as a member of England's royal family.  The island mood comes through in this book but the photos could have been taken ten or twenty years ago. I assumed the book would feature something newer 
 This is obviously an unauthorised film. A couple of English people with a handycam with nothing new to say 
 Even if you want to believe it to be an accident, you can do better than this book. Cristol created this book based on his doctoral dissertation, which was manufactured after (and some estimate to obfuscate and diffuse) Dr. John Borne's initial doctoral dissertation on the Liberty assault which came to the conclusion Israel knew it was a US ship before they attacked.   You don't even need to open the book to know what's inside!...let's take a look at the front cover photo... The photo, claimed in the book to be provided to Cristol by the Israeli Air Force, as a gun camera photo, shows the USS Liberty flying no flag as it is attacked, with even a large splash of munition next to it. This of course reinforces Israel's claim there was no flag flying during the attack, which would then debunk the survivors' claim they had an American flag flying(and put up an even larger US flag after the first was shot down!). -It turns out, according to a photo analysis done for the Liberty survivors' website, this "is in fact a doctored view of the ship just as she tied up at the pier at Little Creek, Virginia, in July, 1967, upon her return from repairs in Malta." The photo evidence is too much to list but here is some of it:  All the vectors and even people on the ship correspond to the Little Creek dock photo. The smoke was apparently falsified - there is no smoke or fire damage in corresponding areas of the ship, in photos taken immediately after the attack. The displacement(how deep in the water the ship sets due to weight) of the Liberty during the actual attack was much greater than the Cristol image depicted, but corresponded perfectly with the Little Creek photo (after the ship was offloaded). The munition splash apparently was added to cover a tug boat that occluded a small part of the front side of the Liberty. A photo of a real wake created by the Liberty does not correspond to what was apparently a post photo wake added to the photo of the stationary Liberty. Etcetera, etcetera. Of course, the fact that there is no flag in Cristol's cover picture corresponds to the fact it is customary to take down the flag once you get into port, as the real Little Creek photo shows. So there you have it, no need to even open this book.  Sorry to say, the photo was presented as evidence in a Thames television presentation before a proper analysis and debunking was done.  This is the second book(the other is the unrelated "Hitler's Pope" by Cornwell) I've reviewed where a photo was presented as evidence, but was apparently otherwise.  If you are an Israeli apologist and want to give a better try than Cristol's book, it's not hard. But you should at least go to the survivors' website and get firsthand information so you don't look as foolish as Cristol. Now that Cristol is being dismissed, Michael Oren is the next big hope for Israeli apologists concerning Liberty. This assault is so dangerous to Israel's reputation that apologists consistently offer terminology that attempts to stop discussion on the subject rather than address concerns, such as the title of Michael Oren's writing's "USS Liberty: Case Closed". The process is consistent, first the apologist (Oren/Cristol/whoever) offers what they claim is a thorough discussion-ending report(in Oren's case even titling it as such), then the apologist goes on with a typical limited and contextually false account, then right on queue, the apologist is soon after applauded for such a "conclusive", "thorough", "definitive" account. Then eventually the apologist is dismissed by those on the other side as false after having his material reviewed, such as Cristol eventually was. Then another apologist takes over the reigns as 'lead USS Liberty reference' for the apologists, conveniently forgetting they were just supporting the last guy who who offered false claims. To some, it might seem strange Oren was given the top prize at the LA book fair for what was a rehashing the 1967 Israeli six day war in his book "Six Days of War". What Oren did conveniently offer in his newly awarded book, just as Crystol conveniently offered, was, once again, "new evidence" that the attack on the Liberty was accidental.  Of course, "Body of Secrets" author James Bamford eventually took great exception to Oren's selective Liberty account, and offers insight into Oren's personal history and his close working connections to those who apparently were connected to Israeli war crimes that the Liberty would have monitored, and that, as Bamford suggests, would have been reason to snuff out the Liberty's surveillance.  The real story, and the amazing and intriguing evidence that is now coming out is mostly coming from NSA sources. The Anti-Defamation League primarily references Cristol and NSA transcripts released in 1999 of helicopter pilots sent to the Liberty after the attack. Of course, the ADL pointing to the helicopter transmissions is misleading, as the unreleased plane and boat transmissions(those taking part in the attacks) are the relevant ones. Of course the ADL doesn't address Cristol's basic problems, such as that silly cover photo passed off as an Israeli gun camera photo.  Some amazing admissions have occured just recently(after 2000). There is still apparently a key NSA record of the attack, taken from a an NSA spyplane in the area of the attack, that is being withheld.   "Of four former NSA/CIA seniors with inside knowledge, none was aware of any agency official who dissented from the position that the attack was deliberate." - Naval Institute Proceedings  "That the attack was deliberate "just wasn't a disputed issue" within the National Security Agency" - former NSA director William Odom, 3 March 2003 interview for Naval Institute Proceedings  "...the board of inquiry (concluded) that the Israelis knew exactly what they were doing in attacking the Liberty."           -- CIA Director Richard Helms  "I can tell you for an absolute certainty (from intercepted communications) that the Israelis knew they were attacking an American ship."-- NSA Deputy Director Oliver Kirby  Write a letter to your Congressman and sign the Liberty petition, if you want the NSA record released!! 
 I really expected to enjoy this - I love Dams' Dorothy Martin series.   I usually read the first two books before making up my mind about a series, but this was so bad that I didn't have the heart to read the next.   The best part of the book is the evocation of time and place: turn-of-the century Indiana from the perspective of a young Swedish immigrant working as a maid for the Studebakers. Hilda is one of the four Johansson children sent to America to find themselves a place and then earn passage for the rest of the family.   The overall story is rather flimsy. Hilda is deeply concerned that an immigrant, almost any immigrant, will be blamed when a member of a prominent family is murdered. When she learns that the police have left in a patrol wagon to question a Chinese guest of Notre Dame, a Mr. Kee, Hilda decides that she and only she can save him. She arrives at Notre Dame after an exhausting walk to learn what the lazy and less righteous of us would have guessed for ourselves: 1. The police have been and gone (they had a head start and they were riding in a wagon, for pete's sake!) and 2. The priests of Notre Dame could do more for the him than she could, i.e. provide an alibi. But in a very contrived sub-plot, Mr. Kee flees before the police arrive so that Hilda can save him later.   Her duties as a maid don't leave her much opportunity for investigation.  The servants' gossip network was supposed to be Hilda's advantage, but she finds the killer by dumb, as in stupid, luck, during an unnecessary piece of folly.     The killer's actions are a little hard to credit: I don't want to spoil the story, but means and opportunity are as important as motive. I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how the killer managed to pull off the crimes. Why would the killer be so stupid as to confront Hilda under disadvantageous circumstances? My guess is that Dams had some scenes in her head and then connected them as best she could with often awkward seques.   My last problem with the book is the Hilda's attitudes toward the US. The miserable experience of immigrants is a major theme in this book, and I don't doubt that a lot of immigrants had a hard lot, but why, having experienced hellish American life, are she and her siblings trying to bring the rest of the family here? Wouldn't you think they'd be saving to get back to Sweden? I don't expect a fairy-tale, but the portrayal of Hilda seems incomplete. 
 As a biologist by education and interest I had such high hopes. I must disclose, however, that I only made it halfway thru this fairy tale, as I had little hope of not throwing more good time after bad. Nonsense! 
 See the rare spectacle of Sean Connery covered in mud (or chocolate pudding) while maintaining a straight face! Hear Brian Keith's contrived Russian accent! Experience some of the worst special effects in film history! "Meteor" gives new meaning to the term "disaster movie." Unfortunately, a better-than-necessary cast is trapped in the wreckage -- including Henry Fonda as the President of the United States. Good for a few unintentional laughs 
 It was awful! The reproduction of the music was grainy, scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to 
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
 This guy is the biggest joke in hip hop today.All of the songs on this album sound ridiculous and boring.The beats could of been made by a second grader and as well as the lyrics.All of the songs are about bling bling,cars,champaigne and how he's the richest guy on the block.He is a prime example of the very sad state that hip hop is in today.Anybody with half a brain will avoid this album at all costs.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!! 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 This was  thrilling book. I laughed, i cried and when I got frustrated with the book I sometimes wanted to close the book and never open it again. What really made me cry was in this book Amy looses her best horse to cancer and scince she was a little child she new him. I recommend this book to anyone who is an animla freak like me and i absolutely can't wait to read the rest of the series of Heartland books. 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 Brannagh's film version of Hamlet blows away every other version, as well as every other Shakespeare based film. It's an easy 5 stars.  Now the DVD is a different matter.  Been hearing about and waiting for this for ages! Every lame-oh shlock film holywood cranks out shows up on DVD and usually big projects like this are milked for every $ they can get with fancy packaging and special editions.    I was part of the project through which a small determined group of fans was able to bring the one season wonder "My So-Called Life" to DVD and there must be close to as large an audience for this.  WHERE IS IT 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 Don't waste your time or money on this book.  It was about as interesting as watching paint dry!  Maybe Danielle Steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out 
 I hated this book.  This family has two girls, Racie and Jaynell.  Rachie is a girly-girl and Jaynell is a tomboy.  It seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  Her parents are just plain crazy.  Mama repedily whipped Racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to "tear up" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  Once Jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. Then Jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on Racie.  Her parents are just crazy.  Then grandpa dies.  Dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  I understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  Children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  Racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  Jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  These people were crazy.  This book is crazy 
 NO KANYE, NO CODY CHESSNUT, NO FUGEES, NO C.S.U. MARCHING BAND...these were the highlights of the film!  Don't get me wrong--they put some good performances on this CD, but come on...would you buy PE's "It Takes a Nation of Millions" if it had no "Bring the Noise," "Prophets of Rage" or "Rebel Without a Pause?"  Just put the movie on in another room and listen to it...it's better than this chopped-up soundtrack.  It doesn't capture ANY of the raw energy, The power or the impromptu jamming (except for "You Got me"). The sound quality is better on the movie, too.  Great film, bad soundtrack 
 In studying this time period, my three children and I have read MANY books.  I found this book to be somewhat boring in comparison to several of the books we've read so far.  I felt that from what we have learned about this time period, this story was not realistic, and perhaps a little "whitewashed".  The situations and humor seemed contrived, and the plot was simplistic.  And I did think that it was preachy.  We do have strong values, but we have read several books that have incorporated these values believably into realistic and exciting plots. This book was disappointing 
 What is the major barriers to effective comunication.  as an manager or supervisor,how to eliminate or reduce these barriers 
 This is my second time to purchase this terrific reference book.  I have loaned it out so many times that I can remember where my original copy is!!  The rotary cutting directions are clear and accurate.  
 I took a chance on this book and - wow - it's awful. I'm going to be returning it to Amazon.   The "flip chart" design is a real pain! And - because of the weird design - a lot of the recipes have no picture.  I'm still looking for the perfect "cupcake" book. This is not it!  Save yourself the hassle of having to send it back and try to look at this one at a bookstore first 
 A positive, uplifting, encouraging look at the world of international sports and its impact on the human spirit 
 This book reads like a text book or graduate thesis.  Those with short attention spans need not pick up this book.  While it did make some enlightening points on the pervasiveness and necessity of metaphors in our thought process, the book then trudges on for about another 100 needless pages.  The basic point of the authors is that; "...we define our reality in terms of metaphors and then proceed to act on the basis of metaphors."  In the process they get quite wordy and go through lengthy explanations including one long discourse on why we understand a sentence to be true.  It tests your self-discipline to keep reading.  The last 40% of the book then dives into a lenghty debate of objectivism vs. subjectivism and the presentation of their experientialist alternative.  The authors present and then continue to rehash their arguments in a debate against a nameless opponent: the evil objectivist.  There is some lip service paid to the less evil subjectivist.  I did gain a new understanding of the importance of metaphors in our language and thought, but not much else that I wanted to learn. The information that I found useful could have been presented in a much shorter form, perhaps a white paper 
 I have been reading the Anita books and loved it ever since Guilty Pleasures. That is why I'm thoroughly disappointed with this book. I'm halfway through the book already and still there's not even a hint of a big bad. After the scene at the club, it's like 200 pages of repetative sex scene nonsense. I found myself glossing through paragraphs just to get to the end of the chapter. It feels like LKH ran out of things to write and stretched a scene into 5 chapters. I mean the curing Gregory part was just wayyyyyy tooooooo loooonnngggg... If the remaining books are like this, I think I'm going to pass it. AND Anita is getting to be so annoying. Whatever happened to her raising the dead or her police work or hell does she even works at her office anymore 
 I liked the idea of replacing social security, medicare, and medicaid with a $10,000 a year grant. Then I ran some numbers in my head.  US GDP runs at about 12 trillion. There are 300 million people in the United States. 300 Million times $10,000 = 3 Trillion (Yes, I know that not all people in the population get the grant, but bear with me.)  US govenement revenue in 2005 was on the order of $2.5 trillion. The book claims that the $10,000 will eventually be cheaper than payments to these things.  I suppose it may be, but I would see that as an indicator that we are going to be doomed to spend less on these programs in the future than we are now. Not that we can replace them with something that will already cost more that all of government does already.  Another sticking point -- Murray is supposed to be a libertarian (with at least a lower case l) Yet he advocates replacing existing government socialized medicine systems by requiring insurance companies to insure everyone regardless of pre-exisiting conditions, and then requiring everyone to buy insurance. This strikes me as being an awful lot like socialized medicine. Murray at least commits a mild offense by seeming to suggest that one can plan a market.  Murray's chapters on the social implications of the plan versus the existing system are rife with pure speculation. Murray blames all of the social ills -- real and imaginary -- on the welfare state. Does he really believe that the welfare state has caused there to be more extramarital sex, and that the invention of the birth control pill has nothing to do with it? It seems like if it rains on Murray's birthday, it's to be blamed on the welfare state.   I do like the idea of replacing some of these social programs with a grant as Murray describes. I do believe that there will be some positive effects (mostly in the removal of government inefficiencies) of doing so. But the numbers will have to be toned down to provide any sort of realistic numbers for the future. 
 I would've loved to have this information more succinct & to the point, it would have made a good article...unfortunately the author obviously attempted to stretch it out & pad it, which, in my opinion makes for a frustrating read.  I give it 2 stars because it does contain some useful information, if you can tolerate & get past the author's overstated & condescending writing style 
 Not only does this stupid POS adore Atreyu, Slipknot, D4L, and G-Unit; he says Slayer and Kreator are jokes.  Virushan, you're a poser with a horrid taste in music, stop playing with Corey Taylor's trouser snake and get a life.  Now to this, this is one of the worst rap albums from one of the worst rap groups of all time.  Just think 50 Cent multiplied by four, thats how bad this is.  Want good rap?  Go for Public Enemy, Ice T, KRS-One, and the Beastie Boys.  Virushan is a stupid mallcore kid with no life or friends.  Whoever shot Fitty', try again...with an AK-47 loaded with hollow points. 
 Though this book was written much better than Foundation's Fear, I wasn't very impressed. You know how movie studios always do re-makes of old movies? Well this here is a re-write, basically of the first chapter of Asimov's classic original Foundation book. What a waste of paper. If you already read the original, then you already know what will happen at the end 
 Ah ha!! Just to catch your attention, This novel is a ***** stars. A mind opener for every artist and surrealism fan out there, based on realistic social behavior and man made complex conditions upon himself overfed into detailed nightmarish perspectives from the subconscious. **** 
 I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!     
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 This book is horribly disapointing. I bought it before spending two semesters studying in Austria and instead of reading something that would in some way prepare me for what I was to experience, I found a biased, xenophobic, uneducated critique of a, contrary to what the authors have to say, wonderful country. The only part that was good was the section concerning food, but you needn't bother, menus in Austria are also written in English 
 I don't understand how anyone thinks this is a good movie.  The story, dialog/acting, and effects were all completely unbelievable and mostly utterly ridiculous.  Especially stretching the bounds of incredulity was the email scene that others commented on, but there were many others.  One scene shows Steve Guttenberg and beautiful companion trying to make their way to the ballrom just after leaving the room.  He steps on something which seriously cut his foot.  That's right, he hadn't put his shoes on.  Talk about lame! It is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  This movie is beyond pathetic, and I wouldn't have given it any stars given the opportunity.  If I were to say anything positive about this film, it would be that in spite of how bad it is, it held my attention nonetheless, but only because I kept hoping the movie might turn around for the better somewhere.  Unfortunately it never did.  You've been warned!  Save your time and money 
 This book was difficult to get through.  The writing felt very, well, written.  Imagine an FBI agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy.  Imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as "this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent" and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe, and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is.  Baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough "zingers" on every page.  He has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances, so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results.  I personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion.    Add to this the idiocy of the main character--acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist, and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages, and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work.  I shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes--when Sydney has met with a "deadly" [Baldacci's thesaurus apparently has only two words: deadly and murderous] intruder in her home, Sydney has a weapon trained on him at near-point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch!  "Milliseconds" before she can fire, he launches himself behind the couch.    Is this "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?"  No, just Baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint 
 My boys have really enjoyed playing with this toy, however in order to lower the bucket it requires a lot of wrist strength and most of 2-4 year olds that have tried to play with it are not able to make it function on their own. It's even a little difficult for me to get it to lower.  The only other comment I would add regarding this excavator is that if the children are not able to operate the arm that makes the bucket lower they tend to lean forward on the toy, causing the toy to tip and occassionally the child will fall face forward into the arm of the excavator.  This toy requires a lot of parental supervision 
 ...if you're truly interested in the subject of public intellectualism.  This is the man who, in "Breaking the Deadlock," excused the conduct of the Bush king-makers in the Florida executive branch (Katharine Harris and Jeb Bush foremost among them), and argued that the Supremes were justifiable in their disregard for the common law tradition.  He is someone whose mouth is securely fixed to the public teat, and having "affirmed" what he sees as just conduct in the 2000 election - which brought to power the most anti-intellectual, anti-democratic administration in the nation's history - his opinions in any discussion of public discourse are highly suspect 
 The Spanish Prisoner had a great storyline but the acting was terrible. Not to mention the lightening in the film made it seem like a Lifetime movie (no offense). Rent at best, but not worth buying 
 Raye has written a book filled to the brim with product placements that after only a few pages grated on my nerves.  Her main character, Lil,  while having some appealing qualities is entirely too materialist and acts like a child at the age of 500.  It would be more believable if she was in her double-digits and just starting out on her own.  The best things about this book are the support characters and the male protagonist.  Ty is a wonderful example of an alpha-male, down to the  way he smells.  Her friends, clients and secretary all add in a positive way to the landscape.  Also, the mystery is a nice one that has a good twist in the end.  It is the main reason I continued to read this book.  This book is chick-lit paranormal style.  I don't particularly like chick-lit, so that was a strike against it from the beginning.  Particularly the over-use of brand names and the materialism showed by the main character make what could've been a 3.5 star rating and turn it into a 2-2.5 star one instead 
 This book came from a recommendation from my orthopedic.. he informed me there was pretty much nothing I could do about my low back except for "Quit with the running and high impact exercises".  This book basically tells you to sit up straight, but a back support under your lower back, and lie several times a day on your stomach, and push yourself up on your arms and hold that position to reinstate the arch in your lower back.. well, duh..  If you are in decent shape this one is not for you.  I could see where it may help if you are old, overweight, out of shape, and don't know what else to do.. 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 Although an avid fantasy and science fiction fan, this is the first De Lint book I have read, and will probably be the last I will read.  The book takes place in the city of Newford, an imaginary city that is a frequent setting for De Lint stories, and draws on a pool of characters some of whom I understand to be recurring in other novels.  Drawing on folklore elements from different cultures, and switching frequently between primary characters, the book tells the story of a diverse group of young people caught up in a conflict between Gaelic spirits that seek to displace North American spirits.  The book had problems of every sort:  * Wooden dialogue, and just plain bad dialogue.  Apparently bilingual people think everything twice, once in one language and then again in the other language.  This gets very tired, very fast. Ce peut te faire fatigue, tres rapidement. * Cliches.  "And, Ellie? . . . Be careful." * Unconvincing characters.  This is essentially a plot driven book, so we don't look for great character depth, but even still . . .  * A profound lack of subtlety.  How many dozens of times must various characters remark upon "Aunt Nancy's" giant spider shadow?  Did the author think we didn't get it the first time?  Did the author think he was the only one who had ever read West African fables?  If he was the only one who had heard of Anansi, what is the point of having this exclaimed upon dozens of times?  What would it mean to us? * Great reliance on ad hockery and deus ex machina.  Given that this is a plot-driven book, the plot needs to be tight, engaging and convincing.  But the author violates one of the cardinal rules of fantasy writing, which is to set up a framework of operation for the story and then take it seriously and abide by it.  You can't have a story about wizards in which Superman suddenly appears.  Here, however, a new and important fact about the central conflict is invented every 30 seconds -- didn't I tell you that we could transform the monster by putting a mask on it?  Even the characters seem a little surprised and unable to explain the internal logic.  It reads as if it were a bed time story for a small child made up over the course of several months.  I understand De Lint has a large fan base.  I must believe he has written something better than this to deserve it.    
 It couldn't be worse. I mean that literally. That's not to say there isn't humor to be found here. In fact, my point is that this is, in fact, an occasionally amusing title. With this cast (Atkinson, Richardson, Laurie, Fry, McInnerny & Robinson) it can't help but have SOME laughs. But it could have been so much more. It's obvious that by the time they came to slap together this little 'help save the Millenium Dome' project, writers Richard Curtis and Ben Elton had simply lost touch with the Blackadder of old. The characters don't quite ring true (even ones they had played before) and the situations seem very un-Blackadderish (to invent a word). We never have time to really get to know these incarnations of the Blackadder crew. If this were a stand alone film, I don't see how anyone could have found these jokes even remotely funny without a knowledge of Blackadder beforehand? One of the great things about the old Blackadders is that, even if you'd never seen one before, every episode was funny in its own right. You didn't need to know that Baldrick's pants were a constant source of humor to find the jokes amusing. But here everything is referring to running gags of the old shows, without a solid base to the jokes themselves. Nothing stands on its own. I don't think you could ring six good episodes out of these characters if you tried. There's nothing to them, they are just shadows of their predecessors. Just like this show 
 This book had many of the same recipes as the first Betty Crocker Slow Cooker cookbook--even the same pictures! The recipes are OK, but many are dull and made with prepackaged items. I'd rather know what's in my food, thank you. Not impressed. The new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook was a million times better 
 The publisher deserves credit for putting together an attractive little book.  The short quotes sprinkled through out are pithy and to the point, while the decorative illustrations are pretty.  Those illustrations, however are the flowery type you find in Asian poetry books and have little to do with Wabi Sabi.  Gold's exposition on the subject is simplistic to the point of being juvenile. Wabi Sabi is a complex topic and requires more depth.  While new to the subject, I have already found two better books.  Lennox Tierney includes photographs of items which actually illustrate the principles of Wabi Sabi in Wabi Sabi A New Look at Japanese Design. Wabi  Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers by Leonard Koren Porvides a better foundation for understanding than Gold's book 
 I bought a Casio PX-110 as a Christmas present for my 15 year old grandson who was learing to play the piano. After 10 months of careful use a single key stopped functioning correctly. I had the credit card receipt for the purchase, but not the original sales receipt. I sent Casio the paperwork I had plus a notarized letter on the circumstances of the purchase, per their request. Casio says they didn't receive the documents and would not repair it under warranty. They wanted to charge me $257.00 to repair one key, which I declined to do, fearing another key would break, and bought a Yamaha keyboard instead. I feel that it is a serious quality problem when a keyboard breaks in less than a year, and a design problem when it costs over $250 to reair a simple problem. 
 I thought this book was about the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. This is not the book I was thinking about. It was a book written by Benjamin Franklin but which is written after he wrote his famous autobiography. The book did not contain the contents of his autobiography but contains his writings that were written during his last years that was not included in his widely read autobiography.  The book title says it is 'compleated' autobiography. The book's title should be 'Last memoirs of Benjamin Frankilin 
 Unfortunately this little book tells almost nothing about how to actually do covered call writing. It is filled with hype about what covered call writing can do for you, but that's where it stops. The whole subject deserves far better treatment, as it can be a very lucrative technique. I returned this book and got my money back 
 Despite the hyperbolic praise on the back cover--best war novel of the twentieth century!!!--I found this Ballard offering so tedious and unpleasant that I gave up on it just thirty or so pages before the end. My main problem was with Jim; he's basically the only character and he's so unlikable that after a while you just don't feel like spending any more time with him. In Jim you also see the germ of the fascist leanings so evident in the main characters of the truly execrable--but at least readable--Ballard novels __Cocaine Nights__ and __Super-Cannes__.  In my opinion, if you want to read the semi-autobiographical adventures of a boy in an occupied country, you're better off with __The Painted Bird__. If you prefer books about life in prison camps, try __If This Is a Man__ or __The Truce__ by Primo Levi. You'll find in his books the humanity so glaringly absent in Ballard's 
 This book is pretty pathetic. The instruction is minimal and the art is just so average it's not even funny. You would at least hope that someone telling you "how to" could do it themselves. Get drawing the marvel way it's not perfect but it beats this hands down 
 In the Long Ago Far Away, I remember reading some of the Anita Blake series, but being no fan of mysteries or detectives I let the series fall by the wayside.  If a writer is truly great, then I can stay rivited even if the subject isn't one of my favorites.  I adore Faeries, to the point of practicing a post-modern version of Faerie Faith with no rules and no boundaries (and hence no obsessive traditionalism).  Ms. Hamilton now has fairies with no rules and no boundaries.  None.  Zip.  Nada.  Yet somehow, this is the inverse of liberating.  Oh, I am not surprised.  I have something of a fetish for well-written negative reviews, and reading some of the erudite, articulate attacks on Ms. Hamilton's writing have been illuminating.  I am fully aware of the direction taken by Anita Blake and I knew to expect it with Meredith Gentry.  So essentially, mixed blood fairy girl (1/2 Unseelie, 1/4 Seelie Brownie, 1/4 mortal - or some approximation of that mess) without the immortality gene runs away to escape torture at the hands of the Queen of the Unseelie Court, her Aunt Andais.  She becomes a private investigator in Los Angeles.  Auntie sends a few of her bodyguards to retrieve the wayward Princess Meredith and bring her back to the Court, where the Queen will make Merry an Offer She Can't Refuse.  Part and parcel with this offer comes the requirement to have sex with the Queen's Guards until she conceives, because a child will guarantee Merry the Throne.  Merry's competing with her cousin, Cel, who is under the same orders to produce a child.  And that's about it.  From some of the reviews here, I expected a lot more sex.  There are a few near misses and a few actual sex scenes, but they're nothing special.  The kink quotient is quite mild, comparatively speaking.  Even the scene that involves tentacles peters out to nothing.  It seems that, if the character is unattractive or undersirable in any way, Meredith will be spared sex with this fiend at the last minute, in the most contrived way possible.  Merry, apparently, doesn't take any for the team.  The most diffecult thing about reading Laurell Hamilton is the way she writes.  Her vocabulary seems very limited and the writing is quite repetitious.  Whenever someone bites/something stabs Meredith, the pain is described as "sharp and immediate."    "Burning and instantaneous" "Terrible and abrupt" "Stinging and urgent"  I'm not even trying.  Along with this limited vocabulary, Ms. Hamilton writes very much in passive voice.  Is, was, were, has, had, be, been, etc.  Dialogue is also stilted and awkward, with normal diction sometimes ignored to give a character an opportunity to say something "witty."  Characterization isn't a strong suit either.  Meredith is a little dull, but most heroines are.  Her sex partners all have nearly identical personalities, and I wish there had been some variety in the way Ms. Hamilton chose to describe them, rather than a run-down of features and attributes.  So why did I read it?  If I knew all this in advance, why did I even drop a dime on it?    I enjoy erotica, and, as previously mentioned, I'm a faerie fan.  I expected the writing to be terrible, but bearable enough for a few moments of shallow enjoyment.  Then I expected to come here, slap down a single star, and go on my merry way.  If at all possible, I am even more offended by the fact the most of Ms. Hamilton's ideas were good, but she blew it by not following through, or by failing to explore character emotion, or by making the plot secondary to the sex.  To have ideas that are actually interesting and then to drop the ball is even worse than having no good ideas at all (Anne Rice's "Beauty" series, *cough*cough).  But I can't give Ms. Hamilton one star, because the ideas were there, shining just below the surface.  The idea of fairies as celebrities in the mortal world . . . the concept of a fairie exodus to the United States . . . old gods becoming fairies . . . etc, etc . . .  So the book gets two stars, and it could have garnered more if Ms. Hamilton had her priorities straight.  1. Ms. Hamilton, you are a grown woman.  Mention the business parts of the male chracters by name please.  Obscuring gential terms with "him" and "himself" makes you look sqeamish and unsure of yourself.  If you want to write something with a little heat and intensity, clarify the act, please.  2. Thesaurus.  3. If you want all the sex, make the non-sexual parts longer so that they represent a plot.  4. Why is everyone so rampantly heterosexual, and horrified at the idea of homosexuality?  These are fairies, not humans.  Why would they possess our prejudices?  5. Let Meredith sleep with unattractive characters now and again.  Refusing to do so makes her seem like an elitist snob.  Enough complaining.   Look at the reviews and see if this is a mess you want to wade into.  I've started the second book, but after the first "sharp and immediate" there, I've set it aside until my annoyance ends.  If you want a modern fairy tale, try "Tithe."  It's considered YA, but it's far more satisfying than Merry Gentry's world. 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 I started reading the book anticipating a great mystery/detective novel, However, it first took me some time to get into it(about half way) and I still found it to be a dry read. I was expecting a page turning, exciting and mysterious book, but instead I found that the parts of the book that were meant to be exciting and mysterious, would be boring and found myself dosing off. A good book makes you stay up, regardless of how tired you actually are. I will give Mr. Kellerman the benefit of the doubt and will read another book by him, but I definately cannot say I loved this book. It was a very dry read.. 
 We read this text from cover to cover for our pre-doc endo course at NSU. To say the least, the text was wordy and often got distracted with details that are insignificant to the general practitioner and unnecessary for the pre-doc student. The faculty at nova have promised to review other texts in preparation for next year's class. Trust me, this book will force you to wade through a sea of useless information to find the clinically pertinant information. Don't waste your time unless you are obsessed with details. I hope this was helpful 
 Pls. Rick Nielsen, "Tell Me Everything"! Why did  you guys get a sorry Producer like Ted Templeman  to Produce what could have been a great comeback  LP? If you Trick fans wanna be in 'My Gang' then  you gotta spread the news to pray for better ef- forts than this in the future if the Tricksters  are gonna stay employed!  'You're All I Wanna Do' and the title track, with it's "Mommy and Daddy" chorus, is kinda  cool and retro for 'Surrender' - now the mar- riage is on the rocks! Like Cheap Trick's ca- reer after this disgrace! It's enough to make  you 'Cry Baby'...Pls. bring back Brant! 
 then our distinguished author should advocate the next logical steps: do away with the NAACP, Affirmative Action, and The United Negro College Fund.  He should also reject his own area of expertise, African American Studies.    I suspect our author knows that the races of man are as real as night and day.  Since he is a "biologist" he should also know that the classification system used in the plant and animal world applies to man as well.    Ever notice that these "no such thing as race" types only squawk about race in reference to human beings?  It's ok to talk about different breeds of [...], but man - oi vey!       The fact that diffuse boundaries exist between groups or identifiable phenonmina does not mean they don't exist.  Should we deny the existance of climate, since areas of hot and cold, arid and humid, overlap and change over time?  This is utter nonsense written by a man who obviously has an inferiority complex.  It's just more leftist swill promoted by subversive publishers, and lauded by muddle-headed liberals, both of whom would deny the Earth revolves around the sun if it suited their agenda.       
 You really don't need this book.  Yes, there may be a few interesting ideas here and there but perhaps, it would be suffice to have a list of 50 to get you started thinking how to pamper yourself and then you can think of better ways yourself.  Okay, if you need some excuses (like "oh, the book said it will be good if I pamper myself this way"), go get the book.  Otherwise, save the money and buy yourself a real treat 
 I tried to buy this opener for my mother for Christmas but they were sold out everywhere so I bought her a good manual one instead, and was I glad I did after recieving one ourself for Christmas, this product is nothing short of junk, I bought the best batteries you can buy~the first can it opened just labored to no end, the second can it got stuck half way through and had to struggle to get it off the can. I then checked the batteries and they were real good, I cannot recommend this product, I agree with the other reviews ~its a Over Rated piece of JUNK !!! In the Garbage it go' 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 Just so you know, this is the old version. The new version came out in 2006. Don't buy this book unless you need to because it costs less than the new version 
 This is a very boring and poorly written book intended to discredit current popular researchers and their ideas about ancient Egypt.  It is difficult to place much credence in this material, given that the authors have so poorly researched their subject that they refer throughout the book to the earliest of Egyptian times as "Tep Zepi".  As anyone who has ever read anything about ancient Egypt knows, the Egyptian "first time" was known as "ZEP TEPI".  Such shoddy research and editing is inexcusable, particularly since the aim of the authors is to discredit other researchers who clearly have a better knowledge and understanding of ancient Egypt than Pinkett and Prince.    The tone throughout this book is consistently dismissive and supercilious, in spite of the fact that the authors present little hard evidence that a cabal exists to brainwash humanity into believing that extraterrestrial Egyptian "gods" are about to return.  The fact that the book has no index tells you all you need to know about "The Stargate Conspiracy".  This is not intended for the thoughtful reader who might want to reconsider or research some of the material presented in the book.  It's more like a tabloid article that will not end.  Don't waste your money.  I'll gladly give my copy to anyone who wants it.  
 Was very disappointed in this comforter. While it is heavy like I had anticipated, it is not soft in any way shape or form, it is like newspaper, it crackles on the bed and makes noise all night long 
 Even though there is an OUTRAGEOUS hidden charge of $7.99 for a $4.99 item...the price is still about a third of the equivalent item offered by Apple.    Edited Aug 17, 2005  Does what it claims to do.  Convenient and easy to use...change my rating to 4 star 
 Don't bother buying this item.  I wish I would have read everyones reviews before we picked this up while shopping one weekend.  After about 2 weeks, you can't tune past 92.5.  Given that it starts at 88.9 everytime you start it on, that doesn't give you many options.  Sometimes it even tunes itself.  
 "The Well-Ordered Office" is about techniques that can be used to reduce stress in your office.  Author Kathleen Kendall-Tackett gives 50 techniques to get things under control.  I'll be honest... I didn't like this book.  The title suggested to me that this book would be about specific office organization techniques like filing and equipment.  However the author only gives a brief overview and ends up offering no help whatsoever.  A good example is the chapter on good programs for your PDA where she only offers categories of programs and no specific programs whatsoever.  Sure.... list management software could be helpful but only if you have a good program!  Which one is the best!?!?!  The book also contains several "filler" chapter that I have no idea why they are in this book.  Chapters such as "Travel safely and in style" and "Balancing work with the rest of your life" are completely unrelated to the title.  If I want travel advice, I will get a book on traveling.  If I want advice on how to balance my life, I'll get a book that deals with that topic, not a book that spends 2 pages on such a broad topic.  In summary, don't waste you time or money on this book.  It isn't worth it.  While there are 1 or 2 pieces on advice in this book, I would recommend "Getting Things Done" by David Allen instead.  2 out of 5 stars 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 This will be less of a formal review and more of a personal take, more or less. Due to the fact I've read several intro books, as well as the primary source material, i have a well-informed frame of reference in the judgment of this book's merits.  Not long ago I said the following: Russell's A History of Western Philosophy? Patooey! The all time worst intro book i've ever read!  Granted, HWP is witty, no doubt. This is probably the book's only redeeming value, meriting it a star. Scattered throughout are gems like: "I would rather be reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than a friend innocent of philosophy."   On the other hand.... HWP is overrated, underwhelming, and embarrassingly inept for many reasons.  Overrated? The inadequacy and shallowness of most interpretations of the other philosophers' works is the biggest factor. Worst of all, the flippant comments are amusing, which provide entertainment in a conversation, but are utterly out of place when introducing a serious work. However, Russell's take on Leibniz is reliable, because he did his homework, occasionally.  Underwhelming? Russell, like a well trained 'whiggish', kneels deeply before the altar of John Locke, supposedly the champion of the 'modern liberal republican.' Despite admitting that Locke is an inferior philosopher to Spinoza, the godfather gets more press. Instead of philosophy in the HWP, we get self-serving propaganda.  Inept? Not once does Russell ever truly take a problem seriously. IThe complete failure to understand Kant, the philosopher of the enlightenment, as well as Schopenhauer (skipping the World as Will and Representation is not a good idea, Bertie) is a huge let-down. Predictably, he reads Nietzsche as a fascist (exposes his shoddy scholarship by linking him to Nazi socialism), whiffs on Dewey's brand of pragmatism, and for reasons unknown, devotes a chapter on Byron. More bizarre is the excessive attention paid to Catholic philosophy. I don't think the biographer Ray Monk even figured this out, either. Contemporaries like G.E. Moore gets a single mention and Wittgenstein, who he greatly respected, none.  Quite telling, Russell was shocked at the book's success - he produced it casually, intended it as a potboiler, compiled from the notes for the adult education classes he taught in the United States.  Conclusion: The shallowness, due to its intent to amuse, the odd bulk of space devoted to Christian philosophy, all combine to account for world-wide success for The History of Western Philosophy. It might be a good starter, but it also contributes to the sense that philosophy is not worth bothering with.   Alternatives: Copleston's series is lengthy, but thorough, and far superior. You can't go wrong with Durant's Story of Philosophy, although it is a bit dated. Luckily, Durant writes as well as any writer in English, making that book much more accessible to most. T. Z. Lavine's From Socrates to Sartre concentrates on much fewer big-names, but has a lively narrative that sensationalizes the content.  After you've read any one of these, then try Bryan Magee's books: Great Philosophers and Talking Philosophy where both consists of interviews with scholars. As for a contemporary account, Delacampagne's A History of Philosophy in the 20th century is a delicious read 
 Honestly, I found this textbook to be hard to follow, difficult to understand, and many of the recipes and formulas did not work. Also, there were not many photos, and the diagrams were confusing. This certainly is not for the home chef, and I hesitate to recommend this to professional students either. 
 The problem is the central character, who appears to be a capricious supernatural monster with unchecked power to tyrannize and confuse all of the supporting mortal characters. The standard of morality portrayed in this book, especially the first half, would shock the Marquis de Sade, the Comte de Lautreamont, William Burroughs, or Henry Miller. Child abuse, polygamy, disfunctional familial deceit, jealousy, revenge, ethnic cleansing, racial chauvinism... you name it, all described without any hint of moral repugnance. The second or newer half also revels in anti-family rhetoric; the principal character repeatedly demands that his colleagues abandon wives and children in order to serve his purposes 
 The good first. There is a lot of good. I enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal.   My husband and I have a great marriage. He knows I have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me. He is certainly not ever wanting more sex, just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes. (In jest I'm sure.)I say that to show, that not coming from a prude, the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it's normal. I am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice. It was dealt with like, it's a fact so get used to it.  Your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look, or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night. The men give accounts of this, like, oh well, doesn't mean I don't love my wife.  In my opinion, just b/c they aren't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts, doesn't mean it's ok.   I found the book to be very very discouraging. That a bunch of married Christian men would unapologetically (key word here)see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less (we're not talking lingerie here) and think about what she's like in bed or what her nipples look like. There's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart. Or maybe they should not do this. It really threw me for a loop! I guess I didn't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are. Not that I think they don't want a lot of it. But I found it discouraging for Christian wives to think that their husbands can't go to work without picturing everyone naked.  I found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it's "normal" and women just need to get used to the idea 
 There are some very valuable points to ponder brought up by the Medveds.  Unfortunately they are over-the-top in sharing their own lives in a nauseating self-congratulatory way.  Dr. Garbarino's "The Lost  Boys" was a much better read, and I am optimistic that some sort of  primer incorporating his and the Medved's points will be made available to  the general public 
 Stories are well crafted, but the subject matter didn't interest me. Not bad, but I wouldn't buy it again 
 repetative, dull, poorly written, and really dumb. As other reviewers note, it is tough to find anything in here that you don't already know...probably even if you have never owned a cat. And if you think that you will learn Cat Speak, whatever that is, don't hold your breath, the entire section is less than a chapter, and the chapters aren't much. . My sister gave this to me, thinking that it would help us with our two cats. Use it for litter. 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 As an agnostic, I eagerly approached Surprised by Joy expecting to have my beliefs (or lack thereof) challenged by someone sympathetic to my point of view. After all, I thought, Lewis was once an atheist.  Surely, he'll gently guide me to the Christian path that he himself followed.  In this I was greatly disappointed.  The book is neither a true autobiography nor a rigorous Christian apology and sadly, rather than using his considerable talents to persuade atheists and agnostics to his way of thinking, he frequently resorts to disrespectful, even scornful attacks on non-believers that are sure to offend and alienate them.  Moreover, his arguments are written not for a layperson but for someone well-versed in philosophy and literature.  And even with all the scholarship he brings to the table, in the end, he resorts to his gut feeling rather than rational discourse when explaining why he decided to convert.  In the beginning of the book, Lewis tells us quite a bit about his early childhood and formative experiences.  His story becomes increasingly sketchy as he ages.   Although his life was certainly filled with dramatic events, such as the death of his mother and his combat experiences during WWI, his accounts of these events are vague and seem strangely devoid of emotion. Other life experiences that most people would consider important and relevant - the death of his father, for example - are barely even mentioned and are dismissed as having no bearing on the story Lewis is telling.  One always has the sense of being held at arm's length in this book. We are invited into Lewis's mind but rarely into his heart.      What is left, then, is an extremely cerebral life story.  Lewis writes endlessly about his education, the books he's read and the influence they had on him as well as the brilliant young men (and it's nearly always men) who befriended him over the course of his life and made him re-evaluate his thoughts and beliefs.  All well and good.    But when he actually comes to his conversion, I'm afraid it's difficult to follow his train of thought.  Lewis clearly expects his reader to be as erudite and well-read as he is.  Sadly, that isn't the case for me, nor I suspect, is it true for most modern readers.  I am not a student of philosophy and I am woefully ignorant of English literature.  All his references to these topics, therefore, were entirely over my head.    Still, it's clear that an element of the irrational creeps into his arguments for rejecting old ways of thinking.  For example, when Lewis senses a certain inconsistency in his own beliefs and the tenets of realism, he's must decide whether to reject realism altogether or embrace Behavioristic theory.  He chooses the former not for any clear objective reason but because, as he writes, "I cannot force my thoughts into that shape any more than I can scratch my ear with my big toe..."  I suppose I could give the same reason for my lack of faith.  In fact, it isn't a reason at all.     Lewis would have us believe he was a very reluctant convert.  Perhaps he was.  But once converted, he clearly had very little patience for those whose views he once shared.  He explains this with a quote from Donne: "The heresies that men leave are hated most."  He goes on to add, "The things I assert most vigorously are those that I resisted long and accepted late."    To be fair, Lewis retains respect for an atheist called Kirk who played an essential role in his education.  But he doesn't extend that respect to other atheists:  "Atheism has come down in the world since those days, and mixed itself with politics and learned to dabble in dirt...I am ashamed that my old mates and (which matters much more) Kirk's old mates should have sunk to what they are now.  It was different then..."  Ah yes.  Somehow, when Lewis himself was an atheist, that particular way of thinking was far more respectable than after he converted.  I suppose he would have nothing but contempt for atheists and agnostics today.  I don't mean to sound bitter but I really expected something much better from this book.  I honestly hoped I would like it.  I didn't.  His reasoning, though bolstered by a veritable library of books, is unconvincing.  His life story, though intellectually compelling, is an emotional desert.  As I read it, I kept wondering, What of love?  And anger? And sadness?  And passion?  Doesn't he feel anything at all?  Even his description of Joy is oppressively unemotional.  Was Lewis really so unfeeling?  The Chronicles of Narnia suggest otherwise.  In short, the book was not to my taste but I suspect it was never meant to be.  Lewis seems to be preaching to the choir, not reaching out to sinners.  Those religious types out there who already adore C.S. Lewis should, no doubt, disregard my opinions on Surprised by Joy - I'm sure they, at least, will love it.  But for those non-believers out there half hoping to be converted by Lewis's words I can only say it didn 't do it for me 
 Look, Zakk rocks. I've followed his entire career, so when I say Pride and Glory is weak, I mean it. The southern rock twinge is actually pretty cool and Zakk plays some nice solos on the softer tunes on CD. But it always goes back to the same thing for every artist--SONGWRITING. It's just not good here. Too many tracks sound alike and the songs are just thrown together. Track 5 is OK. Rest is mostly filler. Nothing you will remember 5 mins. after you change the CD. Sorry Zakk, but it sounds like you threw this together in 1 drinking binge weekend. Good move to kill the Pride. Now if you want good acoustic and blues from Zakk, get BOOK OF SHADOWS. It blows away this lame effort. Pride and Glory should only be purchased from the bargin bin. ROCK ON BLS 
 Although sympathetic to many alternative ideas about the events of September 11, 2001, I cannot recommend Eric Williams' "The Puzzle of 9-11." The main problem is that it obviously is an amateur work. I commend Mr. Williams for his effort and his observations about 9/11, however to be understood by a critical audience, such a work needs serious refining to be accepted.  Throughout the entire book, small editorial problems are found, such as punctuation and grammar. His style of writing sounds more like idle coffee-shop talk or bar banter. 75% of the text sounds more like uninformed speculation than facts and hard theory. The Puzzle of 9-11 seems to be a self-published book.   Again I commend Mr. Williams as person and as an American citizen for being willing to question. However, it really is a book that many, many people could have written, and offers little in terms of expertise and specialty.  Prospective buyers should look for other, more useful and professional books about the terrorist attacks. Now that four and a half years have passed, many things have been written by experts in different fields, questioning the official story. Prospective buyers could check out Scholars for 9/11 Truth, a wide-ranging effort by many experts, including David Ray Griffin, Steven E. Jones, and James H. Fetzer. There are so many others

 I think that Palliser wrote one of the finest genre books of the latter 20th century in Quincunx. Every single page was a plot twist of sorts and will leave you breathless if you have yet to pick it up. But just as Palliser wrote such a complex book in Quincunx, 'The Unburried' is manifestly its very opposite. I really cant well describe this book because what the plot was about I really dont know. 'Unburried is so very slow and tedious the only way I could use this as a recommendation is as an insomnia remedy.  I really don' t think that the two reviewers chosen to be 'Spotlight Reviewers' actually read the book. I perused these reviews and was shocked at how different their opinions were to mine. They must have read the dust jacket and pieced together a review off of that. They are wrong in that this book is very very dull. Read 'Quincunx' and enjoy it, but leave this one be 
 These are, for the most part, slight pieces, a somewhat haphazard collection mostly lacking thematic unity. By slight, I mean that Shermer did not provide me with much new information or many new insights into old information.  There's an account of his experience impersonating a variety of psychics; an attempt at a Darwinian interpretation of the mutiny on the "Bounty" which adds nothing, really, to what's been known for years; a thirteen-page essay called "Exorcising Laplace's Demon" in which Laplace appears only in the final paragraph; a series of top-whatever lists gathered from here and there for no very clear reason. And so on.  I would have saved myself a good deal of time if I had gone straight to page 173 ("The New New Creationism") and left it at that. This piece provides a ten-point rebuttal of the Intelligent Design argument that is useful for those of us who don't know much about this latest metamorphosis of creationism.  But by then Shermer's credibility was so damaged that even this piece I approach warily. Shermer the skeptic is so error-prone that his unintended effect is to make me skeptical of everything he says. His introduction indicates that many of these pieces have been previously published. This I find astonishing. The first chapter alone contains so many serious grammar errors that had Shermer submitted it when he was a high-school senior, at least where I grew up at about the same time period, he would have forfeited his diploma.  I'm not a scientist, and so when I find a science writer telling me that malaria is transmitted by "a virus-infested mosquito" (try "parasite" and "infected"); that helicobacter pylori is also a virus; that "flagella" is singular, I have to wonder what other nonsense is getting past me. Evidently fact checkers and proof readers have gone extinct.  In general, Shermer's essays lack structure, focus, and creative insight. To be an essayist is to be a type of poet. An accomplished essayist - Oliver Sacks, for example -  takes an idea, a fact, an observation perhaps, and in elegant, graceful language explores it, expands it, teases it out until we are astonished and delighted by the insights, the connections, and by a new way of seeing our world. This is an art, and Michael Shermer, sadly, is only a fledging artist 
 Nabarz gives an interesting overview of the ancient historical origins of the early Mithra, and he is well suited to the task, given his background and knowledge of the area.  Then he takes us through history to the various peoples who worshipped Mithra(s), including the Romans. He, like most modern students, discounts earlier scholars like Franz Cumont, who saw a connection between earlier worshippers in Persia and those in Rome. This skepticism is, I believe, mistaken, and comes from a modernist view and perhaps an agenda, which is quickly revealed in later chapters.  That agenda is the "Wiccanizing" of Mithra in a so-called revivalist religion, which he details in the book. Using a dubiously-translated "liturgy" of ooos and ahs (which he tampers with, in the name of his new religion) He then introduces an ancient Female goddess, Anahita, into his non-historical pantheon. It's surprising that he doesn't call Mithras the "horned god" as other Wiccans do. The final blow is a description and photo of an "altar" which mimicks one that might be seen in any Wiccan's home.  In short, the attempt to Wiccanize Mithraism is a dubious, spurious and laughable attempt to cash in on the current Earth-centered witch craze (the book is in the "new age" section of bookstores, not in religion or history.)  A far better overview of Mithras and His origins would be the Mysteries of Mithra, by Franz Cumont, a scholar who spent his entire life studying Mithras, and one which students of the New Age have been trying to "refute" and reinterpret for a generation. However, Cumont remains the towering figure in the field of Mithraic research 
 I was not at all impressed with this CD. Boring. My husband didn't like it either 
 I'm no prude, but some of the actions described in this book go beyond crude to disgusting and repulsive.  Who needs to waste time reading about such behavior?  Don't we see enough of the depths of human depravity on the news? I would have expected a huge protest from families of middle class black people, who are portayed with every variety of perversion and obsession...the only ones who are shown as decent human beings are strange in their own ways, nonformist to the extreme. 
 I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier 
 This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story 
 Although I am entering this review to balance the five star non-review, the book really should be taken to task for diverting kinship studies.  Schneider appears to have had trouble keeping his personal biases (in broad brush terms, agin the guverment) out of the study. In a memoir published shortly before his death (Schneider on Schneider) he admits that he did not use the data he collected and wrote what he believed anyway.  This appears not to have caused any ripples, as his followers (stereotypically postmodernists) don't believe in science anyway.  There is a pretty good collection of essays on Schneider's approach - The Cultural Analysis of Kinship: The Legacy of David M. Schneider, and a no-holds-barred critique in Adam Kuper's Culture: The Anthropologist's Account 
 Can't understand what all the fuss is over this movie. It's cute but so boring. I could hardly stay awake. 
 I actually picked up this book in my church library.  While, I'm wary of christian romances, this one caught my eye.  And I loved it!  Dee Henderson's writing style is fun and her charachters are okay.  She deals much more honestly with the realities of the world then other romance novels.  Having read almost all of her books now though, I have to say that they are dangerous for young women.  Every book is a romance with God playing a distant second to the man and woman who are falling in love.  In all of them that I've read, the formula is exactly the same.  Man or Woman of God meets Woman or Man who is not a Christian with a personal battle to overcome.  Get them together through some sort of danger fall in love.  Even before the non-christian converts though, while the christian is saying that they can't date them, they still kiss and pursue each other.  This teaches young women 1. That it's good to pursue a non-christian-after all maybe you'll convert them. 2. That physical reletionships are okay with non-christians, even if you can't date them. 3. That a non-christian will inevitably fall in love with Jesus if you want them to.  I'm going to ask my church to remove it from our library.  A great alternative is Shaunti Feldhaun's two novels The Veritas Conflict, and the Lights of Tenth Street.      
 I've been using a Win 98 version of this software for years and the opportunity to upgrade to the XP version was tempting. However, it does not work at all in my portuguese XP. After searching for the misterious error code through the manufacturer's database I was informed that it does not work in non-english Win XP. All the previous versions worked fine in my PCs but this one was totally disappointing. Living in Brazil, I had to give up my money since the shipping costs were about the same value I would recover. Shame on them 
 What is the National Enquirer, you ask?  It's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time.  Avoid it like the plague 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 This looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself.  How they expect you to enjoy a movie on a screen the size of a thumbnail is beyond me.  Fun idea to be able to carry this in your pocket but not worth it 
 Michael Dirda, reviewer for the Washington Post, has called John Crowley probably the finest fantasy writer alive. Lord knows, he has written complex masterpieces, "Little, Big", the "Aegypt" series, "Engine Summer", "The Great Work of Time", etc, but some of his more recent works show a really disturbing unevenness in quality.  So why doesn't this wonderful author stop writing pot boilers like this and finish the last of the four book "Aegypt" series, arguably the finest written fantasy series ever?   Now THAT I strongly recommend 
 I was very disappointed with this book. There was insufficient instruction regarding the installation of the DirectX SDK. Most of the source code is incompatible with the included compiler. After manually entering the source code into the Visual C++ IDE, most of the programs would not compile. Thinking I may have made some typographical errors or overlooked some of the code, I then copied the source code directly from the included CD and became even more frustrated that this code would not compile either. Don't waste your money on this book. 
 I don't have much experience with O'reilly books. All I reffered was Prog C# which I found good. I have a friend who has this book. And fortunately, I got a good advice to not to buy this book. A better approach, I was told and have used, would be to download Ant and read the Documentation. Another would be to go for some other publisher( I heard Wrox has a good title on this, but I dont know the name)(I got this feedback from at least 3 People).Please spare us such duds in the future 
 I bought this book for a readings class this semester.  I don't have a suitable vocabulary to describe how poor it is.  The text is inconsistent and full of errors.  The author blathers on without concluding much.  He references his previous work and that of PhD theses (which I can only assume are his own students).  I question the underlying assumptions of his theory but it is never fleshed out in sufficient detail to be understood and examined.  Some examples:  Page 8, the author discusses history, "there were no exceptions or counterexamples (to Newton's laws) until Einstein advanced the theory of relativity".  Really?  How about Maxwell's equations, the Michelson-Morley experiments, the theory of the ether, Mercury's orbit around the Sun?  Page 18, The author uses matrix algebra notation and operations on nonlinear equations. Superposition does not apply to nonlinear equations.  Example 1-13, consists of a redesign problem where one constraint is "no increase in cost", and the solution to the example problem is to add a component to the existing design.  And that component is free?  Title of one section: "Reduction of uncertainty: Conversion of a design with time-dependent combinatorial complexity to a design with time-dependent periodic complexity".    It goes on.  I made it about 100 pages into it 
 i've read close to 100 outlines on bible prophecy. 'watcher's a sincere but sadly poor guide. the information's winded. sorry marilyn hickey 
 I bought the Lapinator as a gift for both my mom and my dad.  They both use their laptops while they watch TV all the time, so I thought it would be a great gift idea.  When I opened the box, I was very dissapointed at the product I was looking at.  It is pretty much a piece of cardboard sitting on top of some foam padding.  I would have been better off taking an old pillow and gluing a piece of an old box to the top of it.  The picture makes it look slick, but it's lame.  I returned both of them immediately 
 While visiting some family in Utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid-summer weather.  We ended up renting "Analyze That" and boy, what a mistake that was!  We were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999's "Analyze This."  The potential was there, it's not as if writers (of course it's never a good sign to see numerous writers) Peter Tolan, Peter Steinfeld, and Harold Ramis didn't have decent material to work with; Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy.  However, this being Hollywood and all, another sequel was botched.  It's because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation.    Despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding DeNiro and some "fish out of water" situations, the movie seemed to go downhill soon after.  The jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over-the-top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as "Crossroads."  Now either they ran out of jokes, they didn't have enough time to invest in an actual story, or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already ("The Sopranos", "The Whole 9 Yards", "Mickey Blue Eyes", etc. etc.), that there was simply nothing left to write about 
 this was terrible...first they had the control box wired into the box it came in, so we literally had to RIP it out of the box to get it out... it will not tell you that you are warm or close unless you are about 1-2 inches from the bear...do not buy! 
 i have not seen this movie, nor do i EVER want to. i've only seen the previews on tv and read about it in previews. why do i think it's probably one of the stupidest, pointless movies on the face of the earth?, because i bet just about every guy who's had trouble getting girls watched it, took notes, and believed each and every single thing that was in this movie, and believed every sentence that was in this movie where you got to hear the woman thinking out loud in the movie. i bet many guys took this movie way too seriously.  well, i bet some of the stuff said in there where it has the woman thinking out loud was garbage. not all women are the same, and not all men are the same... you can't believe every thing a woman says. not all women want what that one individual woman wants and some women lie. but hey, nobody's perfect. every guy had individual tastes too, and guys lie sometimes to.  i for one, as far what i finad sexually appealing with a woman's appearance, like women who are a tad bigger. i like'em to weigh about 140 to 160 lbs. if they're around 5'5" to 5'7". yet there are guys who like petite women(i personlly don't know why).  there shouldn't be a movie that tries to help guys get girls. the movie title "what women want" was just wrong. i bet many guys thought of it as the gateway to seriously improving their game if they're looking for a date.   i personally think guys put way too much emphasis on trying to find out what women want. i don't think that should be necessary. i think it's ridiculous. i think the guy should be himself like the girl is practially all the time and just feel good about himself. not every girl is going to be into every guy... i think self-confidence is probably the most important thing for a guy to have when trying to get women.  i'm a guy and that's my opinion... 
 Blech!  I really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute.  WRONG!  It was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were.  The only redeeming actor was Justin Long.  The rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells 
 This poorly-written superficial book reveals more about the art of disinformation than it does about 9/11/01.  It trots out all the standard hoaxes -- like pod-planes and no-jetliner theories.  But it has some good parts thanks to its plagiarising 911Research.  For example, Revealed's description of NIST's investigation is copied almost verbatim from 911Research, which it doesn't credit anywhere. Compare these excerpts from the book to excerpts from 911Research's NIST page in late 2004, which you can verify using the web archive:  [9/11Revealed] FEMA eventually allocated a mere $600,000  to fund the only investigation of the building collapses that functioned before the site had been mopped up.  [911Research] This contrasts with the $600,000 allocated by FEMA  to fund the only investigation of the building collapses that functioned before the site had been mopped up.   [9/11Revealed] Although it was funded with a budget of $30 million it worked on the premise of the official story, namely, that the collapses of the Twin Towers and WTC 7 resulted from the impacts of scheduled airliners.  [911Research] NIST's investigation ... was funded with a budget of $30 million. ... its investigation is being conducted strictly within the confines of the official story -- that the collapses of the Twin Towers and Building 7 resulted from the jetliner impacts.   [9/11Revealed] In its 7 May 2003 news release on the progress of its investigation, it seemed clear  that the agency had been hampered in its investigation by a lack of access to evidence.  [911Research] In its May 7, 2003 News Release on the progress of its investigation, there is clear evidence  that the agency has been hampered in its investigation by a lack of access to evidence.   Of course Revealed avoids what 911Research is most known for: its overwhealming case for the controlled demolition of the Towers 
 Note: This review was done after only reading the first 20 pages of the book. Please keep that in mind when evaluating the reasonableness of my review.  I bought this book as an impulse purchase after hearing the authors on Al Franken's show on Air America Radio on 11/15/05 because I wanted to get an understanding of, and solutions to, the health care problem.  I stopped reading for two reasons. First: the authors immediately expressed an assumption in the book's introduction that I felt would unhelpfully bias their presentation and recommendations. Second: the writing was so wordy that I felt the author's were trying to add weight to a simple message that was buried so deep in the book that it wasn't worth my effort to dig it out.  In support of my first reason regarding the authors' bias, consider the following sentences in the second paragraph on page 4: "We deplore the wide disparities not only in health care but in income, education, housing, and other important factors that affect well-being and opportunity . . . We seek a system in which the financing and distribution of health services reflect our image of a just society, a society in which economic arrangements reflect a moral dimension."  Now I agree that there are very poor and very rich people in America. I also agree that there are very sick and very healthy people. But the existence of extremes doesn't negate the fact that most people in America are generally satisfied with their lives because they are relatively healthy and are meeting their daily needs. When I bought the book, I was hoping the authors' would answer the question "What is equitable health care?" Is it equitable for the government to pay for medications that control blood pressure, insulin response, and bone density when all of these could be managed by diet and exercise? Americans have a problem giving welfare to those who can work. Why give "healthfare" to those who can diet and exercise?  In support of my second reason regarding the authors' wordiness, consider these sentences in the second paragraph on page 20: "It would have been easy to conclude that all that was needed [regarding medical education] was a marginal adjustment here and a bit of tweaking there. Such a conclusion would have been valid if medicine and medical education could have stood apart from the society in which they were embedded. But, of course, they could not do so. They necessarily were influenced by the world outside of medicine, and that world, that external environment and its influences, was changing."  Now couldn't the authors' have assumed their readers already knew, 1) medicine and medical education are influenced by the world in which they operate, 2) the world refers to the external environment, and 3) the external environment is always changing? It was wordiness like this that forced me to put the book down rather than continue my struggle to find what new truths the authors' had to offer on the topic of health care and public policy.  Since I still want to understand the health care mess and how we can get out of it, I ordered Paul Starr's Pulitzer Prize-winning book "The Social Transformation of American Medicine." I found the book by scrolling down the product page for "The Health Care Mess" and seeing what "Customers who bought this book also bought." I clicked on the link "One Nation Uninsured: Why The U.S. Has No National Health Insurance by Jill Quadagno." I then read the Washington Post's Book World review on that product's page, which referred to Paul Starr's book.  This is what I love about shopping for books and other products on Amazon. I would have never found Paul Starr's book unless Amazon had provided those links and reviews. If you are also shopping for a book to understand the health care mess, read the reviews, the table of contents, and the excerpts for Paul Starr's book in Amazon. Notice that this information is not available for "The Health Care Mess". I googled "The Health Care Mess" and the only reviews available are those on the book's back cover, which are from prestigious individuals who no doubt didn't take the time to read the book.  The truth is out there. Seek and ye shall find 
 This magazine took a radical change in direction earlier this year, meaning most reviews prior to April 2006 are essentially reviewing a different magazine.  I was a subscriber since the early 90's and have recently cancelled.  This magazine had a mid (end of life?) crisis and now wants to cover just about anything that uses electricity.  And cars!  Why would I pick up PC Magazine to read a car review?  Their "improved" layout uses cartoonish hand drawn arrows and "cool" sayings to replace actual review content.  What is their market here?  12 year old geeks with an extra $80k laying around to drop on an SUV?  Get real.  Until this magazine makes another radical change in direction to get back on topic, it is best avoided 
 When you are arguing whether or not Christ really existed (In the words of Stuart Briscoe and possibly others):  If a man believes in Christ and lives his life accordingly, and he is wrong, then he has lost nothing.  If a man doesn't believe in Christ and lives his life accordingly, he has lost everything.. 
 Dr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures.  However, I was appalled by her bias against Western cultural heritage and Christianity.  Her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women.  As a Catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded, compassionate religious sisters, I felt offended by her slur against nuns.  I am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing, but I would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research.  
 I've been had is all I can say, after reading other reviews I really thought this would be an interesting, exciting movie. Instead, the story is lame, the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so NOT scary or at least gripping. I watched the whole thing as I thought maybe I am missing something, but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end. Sorry guys, but this is nowhere near, Audition, Tale of two Sisters or even Whispering Corridors 
 Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha.   Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.  The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.  For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making. 
 I've recently discovered Krentz at a local library. I've read most of her works by now, and her formula is a little worn from being used so often. I keep reading her mostly because there are flashes of brilliance in her  works that promise to be something more, but all of them then get lost.  Grand Passion is the worst of the lot -- I figured out the mystery of the  paintings by the second or third chapter, and the suspense and romance was  so unrealistic I was skimming every other sentence just to have the relief  of getting to the end 
 Not worth reading.  I'm on page 59 of this 184 page book and it's horrible.  I have been forcing myself to read it in hopes that it will get better.  But now that I see the other reviews, I can safely say it won't.  
 This toy would be great if it would stay together and not fall apart everytime my kids play with it.  We have two of these!!  The microphones broke within a month of getting them.  I would NOT recommend buying this toy 
 The good:  the massage function works fine, no problems with the performance, and the battery holds a good charge.  The bad:  how much money is saved in construction by using the  cheapest foam padding imaginable?   The ugly: the 'pebbled vinyl' material on the arms is already separating after six months.  Maybe a cheaper material could have been found...but I doubt it.  Overall good in theory, but very poor in execution.  If some real quality were put into the product, it would rate potentially 5 stars.  'Til then,you've been warned.... 
 The poses are too advanced for younger children. The book cannot be used to read to children, since it is boring reading instructions 
 I have read some of their fathers and mothers books, and he is just as boring as them. I find it difficult to even finish the book, In fact I have not 
 A subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball "nuts" who grew up in New York.   We idolized the terribly tarnished CCNY "Wonder Five" who set an unbreakable record by winning both the NIT and NCAA titles in 1950 (it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled). This book is a fictional addendum to Rosen's non-fiction treatment of the original basketball "scandals", as he outlines in his NPR interview. Unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors -- Broadway and 43rd Street cannot be on the east side of Manhattan; Madison Square Garden has been on 23rd Street, and is now above Penn Station; in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues.  These errors are particularly galling in a book by a New Yorker who played at Hunter College, and they undermine the author's credibility and care in writing. Since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence, the game of who is this really is inescapable.  Hence it is most unfortunate that Rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers, and "a couple are in the Hall of Fame."  This tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as Bob Cousy (Holy Cross, '49), Dick McGuire (St. Johns, '48), Bobby Wanzer (Seton Hall, '46), and Frank McGuire, the legendary coach at St. John's, North Carolina and South Carolina 
 Bought this set at Target 3 years ago for $200, and during the first few months was seriously impressed by them.  They're heavy, cooked things well, and the stainless handles are strong and stay cool.  Never once put them in the dishwasher or put any utensil (metal, etc) in them that didn't belong in them.  Took care when washing, didn't burn things in them, etc.  Somehow the finish still flaked off of both skillets starting at 6 months, and the pots have now also been showing the early signs of retirement. Because I didn't want to pay return shipping or get a replacement set, and the flaking finish was too dangerous for donating, they had to go straight to the trash.  Very upsetting that such gorgeous pots and pans had such a short life, with high care and high cost.  The 2nd star is because they are beautiful and I cooked every day with these - if you rarely cook and plan to take care of these, they might work for you.  For me, stainless steel and cast iron is the way to go.  I wouldn't even try another "non-stick finish" 
 This wonderful insighfull Dad mentioned women in Afghanastan progressing,well actually in the future they will probably  progress way beyond American women since they aren't held down  with the all too common American strerotypes of girls being  mathematically and mechanically inept.Gurian's restraint of  women goes far beyond burkas and delves into the dangerous  area of a limited intellect.The girls in this country will grow up with burkas on the brain,which will destroy their spirit to achieve and fully grow as beings.After reading this horrible  book I can only think Gurian has fear of women getting anywhere in society beyond a second class citizen.Gurian has obviously none his damage already since so many people already believe  every word he writes as though it came down from the sky  engraved in a gold tablet.I found myself furious with him after I read the book.I only hope people wake up to see what a  manipulative sexist monster he is 
 I'm new to making espresso and lattes, so lots of trial and error was required.  Out of the box, the machine performed well and true to other feedback, the frother worked extremely well.  The steam control knob was required to throttle steam flow to achieve micro-froth.  After using every day for 2 months, it now takes 20 minutes to make a latte and there is barely enough steam to froth.  If you're serious about making espresso, pay a little more and get a more robust unit 
 I bought this waffle iron new and have had horrible results. I varied the temperature setting and recipe numerous times, but every waffle stuck to the iron and was a disaster. I hate this model and would not recommend it. Mine is on its way to the trash can 
 For one, this is a picture book with captions allegedly written by Ted Williams but certainly ghostwritten.  Two, although there are a few new Williams photos that appear to come from his own private collection, Williams himself has stated that he lost almost everything of this nature in a hurricane years ago - most of the photos in this book have appeared in one or more of the illustrated Williams books that have already appeared.  Three, the reprint quality of many of the pictures is sub-par; better versions appear in other books. Four, given Williams' recent debilitating illness, there is something a little weird about bringing out a book like this at this time.  That being said, if you absolutely have to have everything that has Ted Williams' name on it, get this book,but only if you already have everything else.  Otherwise, start your collection elsewhere 
 I was halfway through this book and wanted to throw it against the wall,  it was that bad.  I have read her works before, and they were very good --  but not this one.  It was not scary at all.  The heroine was very  unlikeable--in fact everyone was.  I was definitely very disappointed in  this book 
 Shermer's book is an attempt to classify various lines of research into science, nonscience, and `borderlands' science, but he follows no rigorous methodology.  Instead, he subjectively classifies various theories, practices, and lines of research into his three categories, based upon how popular certain theories are among mainstream scientists, and how much the theories, practices, and lines of research appeal to his narrow scientific fundamentalism.   There really is no need for this book.  The celebrated philosopher Karl Popper brilliantly solved the problem of the demarcation between science, and philosophy, ideology and nonsense decades ago, and his work has been endorsed by scientists from Einstein to Hawkings. The criterion is testability.  Scientific theories are theories that are capable of being tested by experiment or observation. Our theories can never be proven correct, although a single counter-instance can prove them wrong.    One can sum up Popper's famous demarcation between science and non-science by saying that the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability.   Accordingly, theories that are not falsifiable in principle cannot claim to be scientific, and so belong to metaphysics, ideology, or pseudo-science.   Popper's criterion of testability provides a clear, logical way of separating science from ideology and philosophy.  Hence, string theory is not science but philosophy, as it currently makes no predictions capable of being tested.  Popper argued that Marxism started out as a scientific theory: it predicted that capitalism would lead to increasing misery among the masses, and then be overthrown by revolution and replaced by socialism; it also predicted that this would occur first in the most technically developed countries.  When the so-called worker's revolution first occurred in then-backward and agrarian Russia, supporters of the theory did not accept this as a refutation: the theory was simply modified so that it became immune to falsification.  In other words, Marxism was transformed into an ideology.  The universal property of scientific theories cannot be stressed enough.  A scientific theory cannot be merely speculation about a particular fact or an isolated event, because nothing new and non-trivial can be predicted from such a speculation.  This point has to be stressed, because it has caused a great deal of confusion among philosophers and historians of science.  For example, Shermer writes in the book:   "Popper's attempt to solve the problem of demarcation ... between science and nonscience begins to break down in the borderlands of knowledge.  Consider the theory that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos.  If we find out by making radio contact through the SETI program then the theory will have been proven absolutely ... But how could this theory ever be falsified?"    Shermer's mistake is his categorization of the statement `extraterrestrial intelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos' as a scientific theory.  It is no such thing.  It is merely speculation about a specific fact, from which no non-trivial predictions follow.  (For instance, it does not follow from this that such life would want to contact us, would share our values, would be friendly toward us, and so forth.)  It is no more a scientific theory than the statement `there are white swans somewhere on the lake.'  Such statements about specific factual matters can indeed be confirmed, even proven `beyond all reasonable doubt.'  But this is only because they are not universal statements.  Scientific theories are universal statements about how facts fit together, and from such universal statements follow predictions about specific facts.  So, from the universal statement `all swans are white' follows the prediction that `the next swans we will see on the lake will be white.'  The former is a (simple) scientific theory; the latter a prediction about a specific fact that follows from the theory, and that may used to test the theory.  Note that Shermer would have formulated his idea as a scientific theory if he had stated it in a universal, testable form, such as: "life arises quickly wherever there is water and an average temperature above freezing, and given a few billion years, some of this life will become recognizably intelligent."  This is a universal statement that relates specific facts to each other, can be used to make predictions about how much intelligent life exists elsewhere in our galaxy, and can be tested (at least in principle) by sending probes to planets in which conditions for life appear to have been appropriate for a few billion years.  If intelligent life is not found, then the theory is refuted, and must either be abandoned or modified.  It is precisely at the "borderlands of science" that Popper's criterion works so well.  Parapsychology for instance, most certainly is a science to the extent that it makes predictions capable of being tested.  But Shermer gives little attention to this field, as it conflicts with his ideology of materialism.  Shermer is not a scientist, but an historian.  And as an historian he has no excuse for being woefully ignorant of the history of science.  At one time reports that rocks sometimes fall from the sky (what we know call meteorites) were dismissed by most scientists as superstitious fantasies.  The idea that the continents could drift was ridiculed for decades.  Even X-rays were considered an elaborate hoax.  Those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them, and Shermer has simply not learned that popularity of ideas cannot be used as a guide to separate science from nonsense.    But Shermer is an intellectual lightweight who is simply out of his league when discussing the philosophy of science.  If you want to read something really magnificent on the subject, I recommend "Replies to my Critics", in The Philosophy of Karl Popper, Part II, edited by Paul Arthur Schilpp.    
 Many fish oil products have Mercury contamination and are NOT filtered out.  This product does not state that it is Mercury free.  So far the only product that was certified Mercury free was only available from my medical doctor 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 This book is mostly hype. The writing is not that great. Japan must be really dying out if the country of some of the world's great literary giants can award such a prize for such weak work. However the book has erotic energy and is fresh in that way. If you are a serious reader skip this book. 
 I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every  genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice 
 This tricycle is simply way too big.  While the seat position is adjustable, even when adjusted, this thing is simply huge!  I imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster.  By then, he'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike, so I just don't get the point of this.  Why in the world would someone build a trike so big?  I did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires, and was fairly sturdy (at least in terms of construction).  I suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike, maybe this monster would be OK. I did have a few issues with design and/or build quality though: First, the grips are fairly fragile plastic and I imagine will break after just a tumble or two.  Second, the way the seat "adjustment" works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar.  This would be OK, but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar, so I had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place.      Overall, I'm just not very impressed.     
 This is a basic PM book with little insight towards growth of your PM skills.  Too much is not covered like SOWs, Activity Charts and such and very little is really touched in depth. Another downside is the Brad story is so simplistic as to be boring.  Pass by 
 This movie is a disaster. There is not one single memorable performance by the cast of "stars". If you want to see a little boy happily running to school, get hit by a car, walk home injured and die, have at it.  There is a reason that this movie is deeply discounted by Amazon. Criterion is probably losing money on this release and they desire it. They should be is ashame 
 Hundreds of writers have waded into the Arthurian waters and some have come away with great books. This isn't one of those times. The Guinivere in Dragon Queen is so perfect she's just a card board figure. The ruin of Merlin's character isn't even worth talking about. I bought it at 8:15 AM read it, didn't like and by 4 PM I got my money back 
 a better title for this book might be, strange signposts in an otherwise interesting world.  He became a devout Catholic while the rest of us were questioning its relevance. C. Pierce's psychologic discovery or insight does not seem especially significant.  This MD does not provide the right presciption for our times 
 The book do cover interesting topics, but most of the really useful things on it are as homeworks assignments. Therefore to get something out of it you got to work (cough** suffer) with it's exercises. It would be nice to see the solutions manual of it to get 100% of its material understood.  Books like these i score them with 1 point. If an author writes a book he should put everything on it, not holding back information. 
 This book is now 11 years old. Lot of informations are missing now 
 Nothing new here.  Seems to be a re-write of the ideas in Cicely Berry's books on speaking Shakespeare.  Was looking for some new insights.  Did not find any 
 Wow!  I was expecting that this book would discuss propaganda from a scientific and factual perspective, unfortunately, the authors use this book and write under the guise of "experts" to further their own political agenda.    The authors need to learn the difference between fact and fiction.  They make a great deal of bold assertions, yet fail to cite the sources of these assertions.  Additionally, the book makes sharp attacks to those on the political right with no real rhyme or reason.  Its the Michael Moore approach to writing, but worse, as Michael Moore at least does not try and pass off his books as a text on the subjects he is writing about.    This book is nothing more than a poorly written outlet for the authors to attack Republicans.  For shame! 
 I bought this book to have a better insight on her life and story. The first part of the book is about Mary M. if she lived today. It was a good story, but that is not what I bought the book for. The second part of the book is nothing but the writers view of religion and not about the life of Mary M. Oh well, you can't have it all 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 That chemistry does not make up for Tim Allens selfish profomance and the plot sucked. I hated  the part when the kid crawls on top of the statue of liberty. That would not fly to day, The police and the govnment would think he is a terroist and kill him. I thought the humor was bland and it is a stupid crapy movie and I hate it 
 It's not difficult to imagine the type of person who would still want this book, but one would prefer not to. Unfortunately it's still all too relevant. One wishes that Henry Ford's idea of history as "bunk" was more convincing!  The resurgence of opposition to the phoney "War on Christmas" should remind readers of earlier efforts to attack American Jews.   Hendrik Hertzberg, in a New Yorker article about the ongoing war on Christmas, made a direct connection to this book. He wrote:    ... Christmas itself, in something like its recognizably modern  ...  form, with gifts and cards and elves, dates from the early  ...  nineteenth century. The War on Christmas seems to have come  ...  along around a hundred years later, with the publication of  ...  "The International Jew," by Henry Ford, the automobile  ...  magnate, whom fate later punished by arranging to have his  ...  fortune diverted to the sappy, do-gooder Ford Foundation.  ...  "It is not religious tolerance in the midst of religious  ...  difference, but religious attack that they"-the  ...  Jews-"preach and practice," he wrote. "The whole record of  ...  the Jewish opposition to Christmas, Easter and certain  ...  patriotic songs shows that." Ford's anti-Semitism has not  ...  aged well, thanks to the later excesses of its European  ...  adherents, but by drawing a connection between  ...  Christmasbashing and patriotism-scorning he pointed the way  ...  for future Christmas warriors.         --- From "Bah Humbug" www.newyorker.com, posted 2005-12-1 
 I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime 
 Even as a joke, this would be horrible; however, I think this band take it seriously - and it blows!  I picked up this CD because I heard A.R.E. were like a combination of suicide, front 242, and iron maiden: Interesting.  NO!!  A.R.E. are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down Liars at best.  The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse.   Example: "Hey World" begins with how much it sucks to be 13.    When I saw Pelican in concert, they were opening (?!?!?) for A.R.E., so I decided to give them a second chance.  The sound guy must not have liked what he heard, because the bar chatter was louder.  "Louder" I yelled, so that I might find something redeeming in their music.  "Yeah, SUCK louder!" Someone else yelled - I had to agree & give him a high-five.  Maybe I would have liked this when I was 12 and didn't know any better.  ZERO STARS 
 This teacup has a beautiful design, but I was very disappointed when I received it.  The cup and saucer were much thicker than I would have expected for a china teacup!  It also had a problem with the scalloped design for the foot of the cup as this caused the cup to rock as it sat on the saucer.  I sent it back as I could not imagine trying to drink tea from this cup 
 I give James Bradley much credit for making this important, though unpalatable, story better known.  We need to realize that as human beings, Americans are not significantly better or worse than most others, especially when tested by the extremes of war.  However, Bradley's basic writing skills, as evidenced in this book, are not appropriate to an important historical volume.  He jumps back and forth between between ordinary colloquialisms and formal historical style.  He uses the first names of historical figures ("Curtis" for LeMay).  Some of his descriptions of firestorm effects are much overdrawn and unrealistic. There are internal contradictions.  He frequently uses sarcasm, which is completely inappropriate for a serious work of history.  It is most unfortunate that his poor writing has much diminished the contribution that this book could have made.  Further, a great annoyance is the word "Flyboys".  I lived through WWII, and my older brothers were in the Pacific theater throughout. One was a naval air crewman, who flew many missions over Japan.  In those days, I do not recall ever hearing the word "flyboys" used to describe any of our own or the enemy's air personnel.  I find the word sarcastic and derogatory 
 The Pros:   -You can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it's adhesive.  -It allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well.  -Doesn't prohibit any functions of the ipod (i.e. sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on)  The Cons:  -Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. I've carefully applied and re-applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways, and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime, especially on the screen.   -If the screen is not lit up, all you can see is bubbles on the screen.   -It doesn't do the ipod justice, because it looks so cheap when applied.  -After 2 days with this product I'm already looking to replace it.  
 Maybe it's the teacher, perhaps it's the book. But this is one of the most difficult classes I've had in my life. All I feel like doing is pulling out my hair. This book is so unclear. If you're trying to learn math, this isn't the book for you. If you want to be confused, I highly recommend it 
 I bought this book based on the reviews here and the fact that it had an introduction by Lon Milo Duquette--I just finished reading his wonderful "My Life With the Spirits." But if this book's content reflects the new hermetics, then the new hermetics is a superficial mishmash.  First, the system is a rehash of Golden Dawn with NLP and Leary painfully grafted on. The first thing I wanted to know was why this combination is particularly worthwhile, but the argument for this combination seems to rest on the author's claims that NLP and Leary are "cutting edge." Well, they aren't cutting edge, but even if they were, why would what is cutting edge be especially helpful in hermetics, new or otherwise? Just because something is new does not make it good. This assumption, though, permeates the book.  There is not much depth. For instance, certain parts of the book contain large crude illustrations of well known GD rituals like the Middle Pillar, apparently to take up space. Whole tables that reiterate widely available GD information are reproduced.  But worse are the numerous sweeping statements that are completely incorrect, such as "Your brain does not differentiate between thoughts and things, because thoughts are things." Or how about "Eastern thought tends to be transcendental, ephemeral, and often insubstantial." One wonders if the author even knows what these words mean or just used them because they sounded important (which would fit with the superficiality here). Or the author's statements that alchemy is an exclusively Western practice or that Satanists can't exist without evangelical Christians, etc., etc. Every page offers a selection of truly ignorant remarks.  This book is a good example of the kind of superficial familiarity with belief systems, breezy arrogance, and just plain laziness that is frequently passed off as knowledge in the occult world, and that is why I titled this little review "Embarassing."  The book is founded on the mistaken notion that there is in fact a free lunch.   This is one of the few books I've read that I would like to get my money back for. The only reason I did not give it one star is because they caught most of the typos and it has a nice cover 
 Not as much fun as I remember. Maybe better if they had a better selection of games (One on One, Hardball, etc. 
 i hate to sh*t on underground rap but funcrusher plus is the only good thing el ps ever done. his flow isnt catchy, i cant understand him, his beats are non melodic. someone will say im too dumb to appreciate him. whatever. there are plenty better mcs in the underground than this:mf doom, murs, c rayz walz, dilated, beatnuts, non phixion, necro and pretty much everyone makes better music than ginger boy. hes a geek with a ginger mustache and he sips ammoni 
 The Eastern Front was a giant massacre. The Eastern Front story is about cold-blooded Nazi Killers, commanders who sacrificed all their human instinct to the Gods of War, ordinary soldiers who became flesh-eating beasts in pursuit of conquest.  Hitler wanted the annihilation of Russian Jews, Bolsheviks, as well as the  destruction and subjugation of the whole Slavic "race" (see Germany in the Second World War, Institute for Military History; World at Arms, Gerhand Weinberg; Hitler, Ian Kershaw).  Nazi intention were not kept secret from rank and file soldiers. On the contrary, these intentions were constantly drummed into German Soldiers like Biderman (Hitler's Army, Bartov; Ordinary Men, Browning; The Wehrmacht, Wette and Lucas-Schneider)  Maybe we ought to keep Nazi war aims in mind when praising German soldier's heroism on the Eastern Front in Forgotten Soldier; Guy Sajer; Hitler moves East Paul Carrell, or Lost Victories; Von Manstein.   Biderman portrays himself as a humble, introverted, pragmatic young soldier.  He was obedient.  He saluted and he did what his superiors told him to do.  He was proud, brave, and devoted to his men, ......etc.  He didn't think about anything more complicated than his Pak gun.  He wasn't involved in  politics,  etc. Coming from German soldiers, Biderman's portrayal of himself is similar to most of the German first-person writers. He's more believable than Manstein because Biderman was not responsible for any important decisions in the 132nd division.  Its easy to view the document as sneaky self-justification.   After all, the text was supposedly written for 132nd division survivors -- men who need to validate their service to the Nazi State, who need to rehabilitate their personal character.    Awful events took place in Russia during  Biderman's  War.  Millions of Russian soldiers killed and wounded. Millions of innocent civilians killed.  Jews were murdered in the millions by Commandos and order police. Apparently Biderman did not understand any of it. Unlike Voss, writing in Black Edelweiss, Biderman refuses to engage any of these implications. According to Biderman he was the last barrier against Bolshevism in Europe.       What did Biderman really do out there in the Crimea and Leningrad? Can we believe him when he writes that he treated civilians correctly? After all, he requisitioned their houses and liberated their hidden food, burned their towns, killed their sons. Did Biderman really rescue the lost cow for the old couple?  Is it true that Biderman never had to shoot even one unruly civilian or a guerilla?  He didn't kill even one commissar?   He never saw any Germans kill captured Ivans -- even though Ivan was constantly massacring captured Germans? Was the 132nd division really the best-behaved division in the German Army? Surely Biderman kicked a prisoner, at least once.  In a larger sense, does Biderman realize that the 132nd division perpetrated one of the biggest crimes in History by tearing up Russia? No. Biderman dodges these questions in his sanitized version of Russia.  He has not admitted to his sins and he has not been forgiven. He ought to return to the Crimea and apologize to the civilians 
 Mike Patton has proven himself to be one of the most prolific and unpredictable musicians in show business in his post Faith No More/Mr. Bungle career.  Although I don't even begin to attempt to collect everything he puts out I do like to take a listen to what he's up to now and then.   SUSPENDED ANIMATION is packed with hundreds of ideas, of varying degrees of success.  Some days have better moments than others, like the spooky intro for "04/11/05 Monday" that sounds like a room full of gurgling ghosts, or "04/27/05 Wednesday" 's sleigh-ride in outer space.  Most of the other intriguing moments on this CD involve some manipulation of found sounds or electronic toys.   Patton's former band, Mr. Bungle, was also a band renowned for it's musical spontaneity, but whereas Bungle's songs worked through it's own inner logic and fluidness, making it easier to digest, the disparate elements of SUSPENDED ANIMATION doesn't hang together nearly as well as the best of Bungle work.  It's progression is more akin to rapid-fire channel-surfing than an epic motion picture.   Despite the low rating I'm assigning this release, I must admit that  I'm not sorry I bought it.  I rarely reach for this CD to play, and when I do it's just to seek out a handful of random tracks, just enough to satisfy a need to hear something wild and chaotic.   Perhaps the calendar concept of the song titles was meant to be followed literally, to listen to one track each day.  Compressing an entire "month" in 43 minutes is too demanding a listening experience. 
 The unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes Dan Brown look like Borges in comparison. Naming characters "Guard One" just shows you don't even try to care. The plot is so hair-brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache -- I just learned, to my horror, that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times. I'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise, but it's been ruined forever by... this. Somewhere, Baby Jesus is crying 
 I ordered this gun because it was such a great deal. When it arrived, i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked (a big crack), nothing a little gorrila glue can't fix though. Also the accuracy isn't consistent, it is always about 4 or 5 inches off from about 20-30 feet. I had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate, otherwise it was 3 feet high. The pellet also starts to curve after 15 feet or so too. So this gun was a good deal but isn't the best quality gun i've had. You have to load it from the top of the gun, which means taking off the laser, putting in the bbs, and putting on the laser again. The magazine doesn't even come off! It still has decent speed, and isn't crap (it's just bad). It was worth 15 bucks though 
 I was very disapointed with this book - give it to my college son and he and roommates tried many and thought they were awful.  Of course, what can you expect of ramen noodles?  My fault for the cholce I guess 
 There are 25 volumes of "America Votes" and this silly ad doesn't say which volume is being sold 
 This book doesn't teach you, it just tells you. I bought this book thinking I would learn something. All I learned was some of things Javascript can do. Also, another negative note, she adds a lot of unnecessary (unappreciated; for that matter) blah! Not recommended 
 Shame on me!  I should have read the reviews before I purchased this piece of garbage.  I had the same experience as others--cumbersome to fill, trouble attaching to the window, then the whole thing crashes to the deck.  An atractive price until you find you're charged more than half the price of the item to have it shipped, not to mention the poor quality design. Couldn't give me another one of these ... 
 I can't post any review about this item cause, although I ordered it on NOVEMBER 5th, 2005  I haven't received it until now, FEBRUARY 14th, 2006 
 yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that "tub thumping" is okay, even if it "gets old after awhile". that song is CRAP!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. EVER! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.  that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song) makes the strongest argument AGAINST ANARCHY that i've ever heard. proves that people who can't agree on anything can't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme.  gotta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel 
 The book does not give any practical view on the subject. The theories are vaguely narrated but not explained. Overall structure totally misses the point of teaching - the concepts and methodoligies are used within the text and elaborated later. Sections explaining various mathemathical models I consider being incomprehensible 
 Being influenced by this book at an early age robbed me of being distinctly feminine.  Boys and girls are different and to deny that is ignorant 
 Absolutely the WORST book I've ever read. There's nothing like hearing a man worth over 100 million whine and sulk like a little tottler. I'm serious, don't waste the 7 dollars on it. Poorly written, obviously the work of a very uneducated "author". The whole "book" consists of him childishly berating other players for their lack of "street" skills, and whining about being let go from the Taco Bell commercials. Unless you are doing a research paper on what is wrong with todays NBA players, don't make the same mistake I did 
 a waste of my time------and i won't even waste more of my time letting "you" know why 
 I had to buy this book for class and I tried to give it a shot and read it, but it was really annoying.  A lot of what we needed to find a job, was discussed in my portfolio class and was common sense.  The book did go over things to do, and if you could get past all the personal mumbo jumbo blah blah that the author felt he had to assault you with, it might be okay.  I just couldn't get past all the preaching he kept doing.  It was extremely annoying 
 The best word I could come up with to describe this book is...blah. There are so many loose pieces that are never tied together.  I would not recommend bothering with this book.  
 Do you believe:  a) Conservatives are either angry, repressed morons; or angry, repressed -- but cunning -- elites whose sole ambition is to strip you of your rights, put down women and them uppity minorities, and play everyone else for chumps, ideally at some obscene profit to themselves?  b) Conservatives are misguided but well-intentioned Americans who simply have different ideas as to the best way the "good life" might be secured for everyone?  If you are (a), you will like this book. The author will use lots of big words and scholarly rhetoric to vindicate your pre-existing views, explain to you how and why radical, religious conservatives keep you under their bootheels, and offer a few ideas for how you and your fellow misunderstood freedom lovers can cast off their oppressive chains.  If you are (b), don't bother reading. This book will insult your intelligence and waste your time. Why would you bother reading a book solely dedicated to arguing against something that doesn't really exist?  Most people, when they hit about age 30, grow up and realize it's not about "good guys" and "bad guys." I don't know which is a worse indictment: That Lakoff doesn't realize this, or that he DOES, but pretends otherwise to sell books to the people who answered (a) 
 I agree totally with Yau in the previous review. Mr. Winchester is more interested in sharing the British (yawn) history of China, not giving us much else about the culture and beauty of the Yangtze and its people. I have been to China 2&1/2 wks and also taken a cruise (5 days) of the Yangtze and for him to make it all so boring is more than annoying, it is almost criminal. Perhaps his ego supersedes him. I would not buy this book, in fact I was uanble to even read more than a couple chapters, it was that boring and dry. The one by Mr. Hessler is an absolute winner.  I read it once a year at least to refresh my amazing memories of China 
 both lipsticks were on back order.  i never received either one. please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received 
 One of my single girlfriends and I (I'm married, 6 years this month) paged through this book at the bookstore the other day. If you want a laugh, it's great. If you're looking for sound advice, get another book.  The one thing people need to understand about John Molloy is that his so called "scientific studies" are bogus. He uses insanely small sample sizes, anecdotal information, and non-scientifically-selected subjects to come up with his conclusions. In a country of 360 MILLION people, I imagine you could come up with a few hundred people who married their spouse because they shared a love of online fantasy games and green chile enchiladas. Compared to the general population, his sample sizes are smaller than miniscule and therefore, the sweeping conclusions he makes are basically worthless. Anyone who's ever taken Statistics 101 can figure that out. You know that saying that there are three types of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics? That statement is never more true than when applied to this book.  Secondly, the conclusions he comes to "scientifically" are completely ridiculous. If you want to get married, be thin, make a good first impression and make marriage a priority. WOW! What a revelation! My single friend said "if only it was that simple." She is thin, beautiful and accomplished, and after a failed marriage 7 years ago has had no luck getting married since. She makes a great first impression and makes her living off that as a salesperson. According to Molloy, she should be beating men away with a stick and fending off marriage proposals daily. But sadly, that's not the case. Whereas I am a loud, brassy, overweight woman who probably comes across as outre when people first meet me, and I've been happily married for six years.   If you really, REALLY want to get married, here is my advice. I am giving it out FREE here on Amazon so people don't give John Molloy any more money for his silly books. Are you ready? Here it is: - Don't sit at home. Get out and meet people. If you live in a city of any size, there will be groups of people who assemble to participate in activities you would enjoy - everything from stargazing through telescopes to needlepoint. If you don't feel comfortable joining mixed-sex groups, join women's groups. Other women have friends, brothers, sons, etc. who you may like very much. The bottom line is GET OUT THERE. Sitting at home will NOT enable you to meet anyone you'd be interested in. - Make a list of the things you want in a partner, and then a list of your deal-breakers. Then go back over the list of your deal-breakers and really examine it. If it's more than 7-10 items long, you are probably being too picky. Just because someone is bald, or likes sci-fi, or hates Indian food does not mean they are not a wonderful person who would be a caring partner. When I met my husband, he smoked. I HATE smoking. He also had a few other habits that drove me crazy. But I could see past those to the wonderful, fabulous person he is. I could see he was great husband material (and believe me, you should evaluate people as potential spouses EARLY - don't feel shallow for doing so). I stuck with him, and just a couple of years into the relationship, he quit smoking. He is the most wonderful man I have ever met and I could not ask for a more loyal, faithful, caring, funny and intelligent man to be my husband. I am not talking about ignoring personality traits like "he beats me" or "he's drunk all the time." I'm talking about trying to look past the "Seinfeld" or "Sex and the City" criteria for dating. "I can't keep dating him, he has long nose hairs." So what? If he's a caring, stable person, he can clip his nose hairs. But a shiftless, abusive guy with good grooming can't change his personality.  - Here's the most important one. Love yourself. Invest in yourself. Even if you weigh 300 lbs, you should be getting your hair done, buying flattering clothes that fit you, and walking around with your head held high. I have been chunky all my life but I dated plenty in high school and college, because I decided early on that I felt good about myself and I was going to have a personality that attracted people to me, even if my looks didn't. My husband wasn't even the first guy who wanted to marry me, and believe me, I don't meet any of Molloy's "criteria." It's not because I am dazzlingly beautiful or I have a compliant personality. I am funny and smart, and I love to laugh and have a good time. That's attractive to anyone. (I also have a healthy self-esteem, if you couldn't tell. :) Don't let one or two jerks, or this book, tell you your marriage prospects are hopeless if you're overweight or not traditionally beautiful or you care about your career. You are a great person and you deserve love. Now go out and get it 
 This book is like a long mailing list of online publications.  The idea is that you are getting access to markets and contact names that you ordinarily wouldn't be able to.  The problem is this: many of the entries are outdated--email addresses to nowhere, email addresses for queries that no one reads, names of editors that have moved on from the publication.  You're really better off just finding the publications on the web that you'd like to write for and calling them to find out who you should query.  That's all these authors have done here 
 I think if you're an old hippie (like me) you know everything in this book already..Now if you can justttt remember it!!! LOL I think it is written for young people who want to discover the art of being a hippie, and adopt that lifestyle, more than for old heads or the people who have "been there, done that" For the old heads, I would recommend a book I've had since it first came out in the 60's (i think) Living on the Earth by Alicia Bay Laurel. Or Carla Emery's book The Encyclopedia of Country Lore, these people lived the life and walked the walk, and the information is 'right on'.  Namaste 
 Sir, not only have I knowledge of Scotland, I am Scottish, have lived there for 4 decades and I have a great deal of insight into the machinations of societies within the conurbations that create the cities of Scotland. These are not kernals of truth in my review - but factually accurate statements reflecting a book. Go check the pages yourself and you will see that no where have I made this up! I challenge to tell us all, have you even BEEN to Scotland yourself? If indeed you knew Scotsmen, you would have a full and complete undertanding of my review!! Apparantly you do not!! And therefore you are in no position to discuss the factual relevence of my review 
 Rise of the Vulcans contains some useful information.  However, Mr. Mann is on a respected historian's PNAC list of 320 members, signatories, and authors. This  would, from my perspective as a published researcher, disqualify him as an "excellent source."  Far better to read Gary Dorrien's impartial  "Imperial Designs."  Mr. Dorrien is not a member of the PNAC lobby.  
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 Dio just doesnt have what it takes in this one. The whole band is not in tune with each other.  I was very disappointed in this concert. By the third  song I was ready to turn it off. If I could, I would try and get my money back. Sorry Dio,  And I'm a big fan too 
 I'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face (same would go if I were reviewing The Fear of Flying or A Room of One's Own, both of which are far superior to this outing, although of different genres), but I'll go ahead and write one anyways. Nafisi's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in Tehran didn't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work. Nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students. I know I may get lambasted for saying so, but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion. Instead, we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general. The layers of interpretation for a character such as Humbert is simplified to either he's a villian or a misunderstood villian, neither of which deals with many of the nuances Nabakov has included. You would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students. The strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the West who comes back to Iran to teach. I think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context, yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave English professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country. On a more stylistic level, I was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text, as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them, actually become a massive blob without much indivuality. I had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another. Her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else, even though he does play an important role, although a subtle one in many scenes. I think I expected a lot from this novel that I couldn't get from picking up a newspaper and I didn't get much beyond that. 
 I have never read such bull**** in my life.  As an educator with her recent Masters in Education, I debunk Greene's theories.  I suggest reading actual research done by Phd's and educators such as: A.R. Sadovnik; H. Kohl; R.P. McDermott; J. Bettie, M.A. Gibson; M. Polluck; Fine, Weis, & Powell; R. Rist; J. O'Neil .....to name a few.    When Jay Greene has read from all of the experts above, spent a few years in schools doing the work of an innovative, caring, open-minded teacher, and interviewed students from underpriviledged back grounds, then he can write a book about schools. Our students are not sick patients and our schools are not hospitals, yet Greene sticks to this metaphor in order to make his reader's think that education is something as simple as a broken toy.  In fact, education is about teaching our children to become critical thinkers: something Greene does not want his readers to do.   
 This is a great read that will have you lol and thinking at the same time. The writer is talented and gifted and can turn a phrase as fast as you want to turn the page. Perspective, compassion and curiosity are operative words in this outstanding work. I can only imagine one of the Wilson brothers playing the writer in the flick. Don't let the title scare you off as once you get into it you will have made a deposit that will reap you interest 
 The Alex Cross series by James Patterson started out incredibly strong with a couple of excellent novels to the start the series in "Along Came a Spider" and "Kiss the Girls."  These novels were truly exceptional when it came to being edge of the seat thrillers, page turners, and plot twisters.  They were a standard by which I and many others judged other novels in this genre.  As the Cross series continued, the quality of the novels began to decline.  For one, Cross is supposed to be a detective.  However, as this series has progressed, he has done less and less detective work.  He usually just follows leads until he happens upon the villain, and then Cross is praised as a major hero.  Second, the plot twists, for which this series use to be famous for, have become very contrived.  Instead of that "I can't believe I didn't see that coming feeling," or "man, was I fooled" sensation, the plot twists frequently leave me saying, "that was absolutely ridiculous."  Many of these very flaws have found their way into "Londond Bridges."  This novel picks up where "Big Bad Wolf" left off.  Some sort of Russian mad man has created a criminal empire, is capable of unspeakable cruelty, and has more criminal plans to execute.  Cross, formerly of the Washington P.D. and now with the FBI, has been tasked with tracking down the Wolf.  This novel, like the others in the series, switches back from first to third person story telling.  When the chapters focus on Cross, they frequently are told in first person from Cross's point of view.  When other characters are central to the storytelling, then the narrative switches to third person.    This is not necessarily a bad thing, but in the later chapters, the third person omniscient narrator lies to the reader!  To be clear, the narrarator doesn't provide clues and lets the reader jump to their own conclusion.  The narrator deliberately tells the reader something that isn't so.  Then, the narrator attempts to turn this into a plot twist a few pages later.  This is extremely aggravating.  Many, if not most, of the plot twists in this novel just come off flat.  To a certain degeree, you are left asking "who cares?" or thinking to yourself "he couldn't possibly thought he got him this time."  The redeeming quality of this book is that Patterson doesn't pull punches.  Several monuments, buildings, and bridges throughout the world are targetted by the Wolf.  Don't expect last second rescues.  In addition, Cross's personal life has more and more problems thrown at it.  The resolution of those problems doesn't happen easily, but at least Pattrson doesn't let Cross off easily.  My opinion is that perhaps Patterson has spread himself a little too thin across all his projects.  He just posted in his blog that he has five, and maybe six, novels to come out next year.  It appears the focus needed to make a great Cross novel is lacking.  I've heard good things about "Mary, Mary," the next novel in the series, so I suspect I will pick that one up.  However, it is potentially my last Cross, if not Patterson, novel.  Overall:  2.5 star 
 I would have.  I have never read Danielle Steel, and once I went to pick up a book of hers and saw that it was priced above the normal amount for a paperback.  I put it down, assuming she must be really good, but as I hadn't read anything by her, I wasn't willing to pay extra to do so.  Well, I got Safe Harbor from my local library on audiobook and figured I'd give her a try.    As I listened to this novel, I got very tired of the amateur lack of descriptiveness, and of the redundancy.  I noticed that a few things were said over and over again throughout the novel, like the fact that she had so much to do before the tragedy, and now... afterward she had too much free time, and even though things were hard before, she'd rather have the "business" of a mentally ill son and a husband that didn't care about her.  As if the readers wouldn't remember, or as if we didn't get her point the first 3 times. Many things were repeated like that, and I felt like I was listening to a fifth grade creative writing assignment where the student had to meet a word requirement and didn't have enough content.     Ophelie is weak, simple, and boring, as is Matt.  They have no personality.  The version I am listening to is the unabridged verson, so I can't possibly be just missing something.  I understand that this is supposedly a novel of triumph and the will to survive, but she didn't even care for her child, and it had been a year.  Perhaps these things do happen in real life, but I'd much rather read about women with some semblance of a spine. It should have been one or the other, Ophelie's husband should have been worth mourning so thoroughly.   I assumed this must have been one of her very first novels for it to be so blah, but I checked the publication date... and I'm in shock.    Perhaps Danielle Steel feels she is above having to deliver a quality novel with her fame, I can't begin to understand how such a reknown author could release something so terrible. 
 Ok, I like this series, buy honestly, it did not need four recap episodes in a row.  The naration doesn't give any new insightsor reveal anything about the plot.  If I had known that I would have bought this disk last, if at all 
 I bought this thing to stick on the underside of the hutch over my desk. I was very disappointed in the dimness of the light. If there was another light on in the room, it was hard to tell that this one was on at all.   The adhesive patches didn't stick for very long. Unfortunately, they decided to fail while my laptop screen was under the light. The falling light put a small permanent dent in my screen.   I don't recommend this thing to anyone 
 This book is very disappointing! Very few recipes and a lot of pages wasted on things such as warning the reader to be careful while cooking. Is it really necessary to include a recipe on how to make steamed rice? This book also claimed to include vegetarian recipes, but very few were provided. Some of recipes look promissing, but really not worth buying because there are too few recipes and too many page fillers 
 Magical Child does have its moments but these are few and far between.  One has to wade through overwrought hyperbole and constant repetition to get at the few insights Mr. Pearce does have.  His comments on childbirth  are poignant and do illustrate just how far we have allowed technology and  modern medical practice to distort what should be a joyous and natural  process.   This book is laced with annoying terminology and proffers claims  of clairvoyant capabilities that would shame a supermarket tabloid.  Had  the author concentrated more on child development and less on developing a  polemic, a more insightful and useful book would have been the resul 
 Worth no more than a glance.  Which I actually regret to say, considering the amount of time, attention and determination to explain every single damn frame of this fascinating movie the good Professor obviously devoted to his project.  Nonetheless, any serious attempt to make sense of his every profundity is absolutely guaranteed to turn off all but the most tiresomely nerdish cineaste.  It took me two years to build up the desire to make it all the way through - and I am a fanatic about Psycho.    Thus the scholars continue their age-old campaign to ruin enjoyment of art. Enough of this sort of psuedo-intellectual compulsive-obsessive navel gazing is certain to result in blinding students to an honest appreciation of film just as successfully as a few decades of it has soured most of us on reading literature for pleasure.   They say that those who cannot do,teach.  But what exactly is it that they do try to teach? (And just wait until the PhDs get around to videogames!)  Anyway, what is saddening and maddening about Mr. Durgnat's effort is that there are indeed numerous excellent and fascinating insights about Psycho to be discovered amidst its many pages of self congratulation.  Had these pages been briskly edited down into a concise and readable essay - say one quarter the book's length - I am certain that it would have earned and deserved a much wider and truly appreciative audience.     Unfortunately, as it stands, an honest admirer of this marvelous and historic film can only be obligated to shout out - in true horror-mode fashion - to the curious reader thinking of taking a peek deep down inside: Don't go in there!  Or, if you must, just borrow a copy for a quick "diegetic" browse. Or read Mr. Rebello's excellent "The Making of Psycho" instead 
 I haven't read many of her newer books but I saw this one in paperback and grabbed it.  So disappointing!! The plot was formulaic and the continual, random introduction of a new character without explaining fully their significance was extremely annoying and confusing.  I forced myself to read this book thinking that eventually it would hook me; it never did.  I usually inhale good books (read in a couple days, a week max) but this one took me three weeks to read. The ending "twist " seemed forcibly abrupt and unbelievable.  MHC is/was a great author, but I'd recommend sticking with her older books 
 Although there are some great recipes in the book, too many of them do not give the English names for the ingredients and you'd have to be in Mexico, or close to the border, to be able to find many of them 
 Do not waist your time buying this book.  Even the most casual fan of the Patriots will know of or has heard every anecdote Felger draws upon. In fact, all the research needed for this book could have been extracted from the newspaper archieves from the Globe or Herald. No need to quote the likes of Pat Sullivan or Gino. Felger would have been better asking Art Donovan for old Colt stories and making them up as Pats stories.  Rather than be cutting edge, by discussing problems such as drugs, alcohol, gambling, domestic violence or the real cut throat antics of professional football (something the Pats are famous for), Felger sold out to the team he covers daily.  SAVE YOUR MONEY. And one final note; FIRE THE PROOF READER!!!  I have never read a book with more typo's i.e., Den Dreith??       
 The End of the Hamptons is less than meets the eye. The author has done little serious research and conflates gossiip with his superficial and dated Marxism. Indeed, to suggest that the secessionist movement to create Peconic County was Marxist inspired, as he does, borders on the psychotic.   Harold Wit and I founded the Group for America's South Fork, yet the author spoke to neither of us.  He gives enormous credit to one individual, Hal Ross, who played only a minor role in the environmental movement that arose from a passion to protect the farms.  As the author of the Suffolk County Farmland Preservation Act, I  find this incredible. There is a real need for a serious study of what happened on the South Fork politically and socially, but this is not it.  Ian Marceau, who was the first director of the Group for America's South Fork, and who is lauded as a kind of saviour by the author, told everyone that he would work for the developers if they paid him more than the environmental group did. But don't look for this or any other truth in this slight and useless tract. The author's hatred of the Hamptons has its origins in the politics of resentment, which is utterly tiresome.

 I was left wanting a little more after getting this book.  You would think a Vogue book would have up to date styles.  I found a lot of the patterns dated and even kind of ugly.  I wouldn't spend my valuable time knitting something that I wouldn't want to wear myself 
 We have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where I work, but he isn't nearly as menacing as this sucker! In fact's he's kinda friendly. This guy's a beast...blood red eyes, sharp claws, looks like he'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom. No ordinary broom neccesary here, friends, no, what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick. Buy this guy, set him in the windows of a dark room, and call the cops. God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games. Would get more stars, but he's damn expensive 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 Despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century, Byatt, in all her annoyingly feminist glory, has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet. Each and every character is lacking in charisma, humour and, in fact, any other attractive facet about their personality, offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy, thus leaving no hero, so necessary to such a story.    Then there's the sub-plot literature which was all, unfortunately, written by the woman herself. To interlink the text with poetry and letters is, admittedly a good idea, but the quality is dire. Could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most? And chapter 10...just too long. So unneccessary.    This is, without a doubt, the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read, and would recommend it to no-body other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea 
 Well, this CD is okay but unfortunately the two tunes that they released on the radio are probably the best on the CD 
 I am wondering WHEN this plague will be over.... and WHEN we'll be set free to listen to real music... We all are so tired of her  
 First and foremost, I think that the idea that the Avengers were something that needed to be 'fixed' is a given: In an era where the continuity and consistancy, for what it was, of the Marvel Universe is largely ignored, this series fits. Too many people wanted the 'X-men' to be the model of the Avengers, and simply put, it could never happen. 'Avengers Disassembled' did indeed generate interest, did indeed act to launch 'the New Avengers' and 'Young Avengers', and did propel BMB forward as the main writer for too many Marvel titles...    But it is piss poor as a comic.  Brian Michael Bendis is not a bad writer. Simply put, his other work such as 'Powers' is decent. The problem here is that the strength of the Marvel Universe has always been both exciting storytelling, but the continuity and interconnected nature of the MU. The Avengers represented that strength, perhaps better than any other group. What Bendis did was simply pander to both the 'newer' reader, and in some ways became overzealous in the desire to make a 'different, all-new' Avengers, by completely destroying the 'Old Avengers'.  The problem is, 'Avengers Disassembled' is schlock. It's not even good writing. It has many issues that were simply ignored for the sake of shock. Continuity, pacing, characterization, and importantly the resolution, leaves the reader with a bad taste in their mouth, and more importantly, sets a trend that fractures and destroys the house that Stan and Jack built. The Scarlet Witch? Come on.....that is reaching....why couldn't it be Loki, the villain who 'Created' the Avengers? Why does it have to be the continually over-used 'Enemy Within' story? This was simply sub-par work from a writer who has better talent and skill. I think personally BMB couldn't wait to start 'New Avengers', and forgot that there were Avenger fans out there.   To me, A:D could have been so much more, something that really defined the next generation of Marvel writers and fans, but instead acted to alienate the older and dedicated fans in lieu of appealing to the younger generation. A:D could and *SHOULD* have been the pentultimate chapter in the Avengers, but instead all it is known for is the launch of the next series, the 'death' of Hawkeye, and the inability to really bridge the gap between the 'old Avengers' and 'New Avengers'.   I expected more, I got less. 
 In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of "how much do they have in common beides ABC?"  After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love.  While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place.  As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way).  I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever.  
 I found htis book disgusting and it literally made me physically ill with all of the sexual remrks, this book is built on sex and nthing else and i found the parts with Leyna Shaw particulary disturbing, also the fact that roger was a sexually starved pathetic hman, after he had intercourse for the first time he was only excited about the fact that he had found another way to stimulate himself!  I found this gross and completely inapropriate the only way to make this book better would be to burn it 
 I really did love his collaboration with Deepak on Living Beyond Miracles, but I am beginning to grow tired of hearing the same stuff. If you want original and someone who is a gifted writer and humble man, Deepak is so much more of a deep thinker. I get really tired of hearing Wayne regurgitate other people's work. It is as if he doesn't have an original thought without quoting someone else's work.  And when he told the audience thank you for him being able to buy a house on Maui, I was actually a little bit offended in that I felt sorry for the audience. (I saw this on PBS) At first, they laughed and then they actually looked sad after he said it. I have heard him do this in every single audio work I have listened to in some way or another, and it is truly full of the ego he tells us to get away from.  I know we're all human, but there always seems to be a sting in his work that shows how big his head really is. Too bad! Without it, he could change so many more people's lives 
 I regret this purchase. This clock has a very, very low projection beam that barely makes it to my ceiling from my bedside table. It's definitely not readable if you have diminished eyesight and aren't wearing glasses, as is the case with better models.  Even more troubling, the atomic clock part seems to set itself to random times in the middle of the night.  On the positive side, the temperature reads accurate and it's nice to have both inside and outside temps in a cheaper model 
 A triumph of crass commercial misinformation and hyperbolic dilettantism over actual learning. Bragg and his handlers, in their rush to make a quick buck, seem barely to have skimmed a few shady amateur websites for their facts. Those readers with any education will find their eyebrows rising with incredulity to read that the Indo-European languages stem originally from India; that English is a rarity among languages for not being controlled by a French-style scholarly academy; that Shakespeare, apparently in need of even more credit, invented no fewer than 2,000 new English words; and that Bede apparently had a time machine, since his quotation of the then 300-year-old letter to Aetius is related as if Bede were the author. Beyond the unblinking confusion over basic facts, the story-telling style ham-handedly anthropomorphizes English itself, alternately "wanting all the space it could claim" or growing "confident enough to take on newcomers", as a "battle-hardened" hero with mysteriously unique qualities, smacking of manifest destiny, that could only be perceived by an author who has never read the history of any other language or heard of the concept of sampling bias. For example, English is characterized as having an almost superhumanly unique "capacity to absorb other" languages, in a breathless description requiring the support of no fewer than three sinister adjectives - "cunning", "subtle", and "ruthless" - just in one sentence. Telling, then, that the guileless five-star reviewers' praise emphasizes such qualities as "easy to read". The less undiscerning will balk at hunting out the residue of actual knowledge from among Bragg's galloping storytelling, unless as a parlor game, and will find far more profit with any of a large number of excellent, slightly less easy alternatives. And by the way, the English translations from Frisian omit entire clauses 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 One of the worst examples of Physics text books.  Explanations are poor.  Very limited number of examples.  And the examples are not clearly explained.  By making it too simple the author has sacrificed rigor and has ended up confusing students.  I would not recommend this text book as an introductory text book on physics to juniors and seniors in high school.  I am yet to find a better book than Giancoli's for a non-calculus based introductory physics text book 
 The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect.  However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry!  It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending.  To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel!  Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS!  It is absolutely unnerving!  This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know.  But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst 
 God, what a hack! She really should give up writing and devote herself to sewing patches on Tucker's Toughskins 
 Is Ms. London a native speaker of English?  If so, her editor should clue her in on the use of colloquial language.  Some of the dialogue between Leah and Michael is so stilted as to not be believed, viz., "I do not think I can do this."  "I am sure that you can."  Et cetera.  Real people just don't talk like that.  And how many times can a reader take watching the silly break-ups between two supposedly adult people? Sorry to be so negative, but this author needs to take a creative writing course or something.  I think I'll pass on any of her other titles 
 When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies.  Now that twenty years have passed, all I can say is that it is so lame and corny that it's kind of embarrassing admitting that I used to like it so much.  Sure I still get a kick out of state-of-the-art (back then, at least) aircraft steaking all over the place, engaged in dogfights and all that... but that's about it.  The whole story is really half-baked, and not much good can be said about the acting.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, trust me, you haven't missing much and I'd recommend not wasting your time on it 
 Gwen's (well, not that she invented these methods but she does emphasize them in the book) basic principals of eating when hungry and stopping when satisfied are very effective. Obviously, if you need to lose weight you need to quit eating so much.   BUT anyone reading this book should be very careful. Gwen feels that overeating means that you're being disobedient to God. And being disobedient to God will block your entrance into Heaven. Thus overeating will cause you to be rejected by God (you will not be accepted into the Kingdom of Heaven).   One must also be careful as this book is part of a full program, WeighDown Workshop, which is basically a tool for recruitment into Remnant Fellowship, Gwen's church (that's pretty much a cult).   However, if you follow the basic principles you will lose weight for sure. I did lose weight but I also picked up some really bad habits (like I stopped exercising and started starving myself instead (I was so weak I had to take a nap everyday for atleast 2 hours) to lose the extra weight). But if you speak to the people who lost a lot of weight and they are truly honest with you, they will admit that they eventually turned to starving themselves. Gwen suggests that you shouldn't exercise because then you are "helping" God take the weight off of you and you're not being totally obedient by fully relying on God. So by not exercising one has to eventually just start starving themself in order to lose the extra weight. By the way, Gwen sees carrying extra weight as sinful (this means you're being disobedient).  Bottom line, I would probably try some of the other spiritually focused books that talk about the same principles (eating when hungry, stopping when full). I do think the spiritual aspect is very important as that gives you the extra support you need to accomplish such a hard task as losing weight.   I have not read it but it's been suggested to me by ex-WeighDown members to try ThinWithin (same principles but with God's SUPPORT not God's VENGEANCE). It's on it's way in the mail now so we'll see!   If you're a Christian, pray before ordering anything and He'll let you know what you need to do. Then listen and DO IT!  : 
 If you are not educated in mythology and the like, skip this book. I thought it would describe the history of the Inca Empire and mention mythology while doing so, but this book is MAINLY about the mythology itself. Only for experts in the field if you ask me, not for the general public. Written in a boring style 
 This book is one of the most obnoxious partisan screeds I have come across in a long history of reading about this region. The authors conveniently ignore the entire political context, that of Isreal's belligerent military occupation of Palestinian territories, which is what the people they have written about are fighting against.  Such decontextualized, depoliticizing representations lead readers to interpret the subjects of this book as simply deranged individuals, rather than politically motivated people who are shaped by and reacting to their history and social context. In addition, the authors either misunderstand or deliberately misrepresent the range of complex meanings associated with martyrdom in Palestinian society, which in fact go well beyond the issue of suicide bombers. Drawing on the most cliched set of Orientalist caricatures, the authors portray their subjects as alternately murderous, backwards, bizarrely exotic, sadistic, or simply crazy. This is not a book for anyone who actually wants to learn about the social, political and religious situation in Palestine and their relationship to martyrdom and suicide bombers

 After reading his book NIGHT and being moved by Wiesel's holocaust experiences in the setting of a Nazi Concentration camp, I decided to read TWILIGHT when I saw it sitting next to NIGHT in a bookstore.  TWILIGHT turned out to be a very weird novel whose purpose I never could surmise.  I took it back to the bookstore for a refund.  I highly recommend reading Wiesel's NIGHT, but suggest avoiding TWILIGHT which is bizarre and perplexing 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 The author's method of "revealing...deeper organizational characteristics" is to arbitrarily circle arbitrary sets of notes, assign them meaningless names like "4-17", and make trivial assertions about the integers from zero to eleven 
 According to this book, the way to have a "Priceless Wedding for under $5000" is to rope your friends and family into footing much of the bill by providing to you, free of charge, catering services, music, photography, ceremony and reception locations, flowers... and so on.  In the price breakdowns in the book, huge ticket items are not even counted as costs if someone other than the bride or groom writes the check or does the work.  Oh, and items bartered for are also counted as a "free" items.  Also, the rings, the honeymoon, "pre-wedding" stuff, such as the rehersal dinner, are not counted in the cost. Finally, some of the figures in the sample budgets are totally unrealistic.  For example, in at least one incident, under stationary (for 100+) the total would not even pay for the postage (invitation, RSVP, thank-you notes) let alone the stationary itself.. 
 I am getting into Benchrest Shooting and gunsmithing match quality rifles.  I was hoping that this book would give me some good info and teach me some new techniques.  Unfortunately the book is pretty dated and is more suited to hunting rifles and actions.  The illustrations are sometimes blurry and all are in black & white.  There is some good information but there are a lot better books out there in my opinion.  For benchrest precision, I just got a book from John Hinnant titled "Complete illustrated guide to precision rifle barrel fitting", it is a lot better.  YMM 
 Let it first be said that everyone who considers themselves a serious student of film should see "Blue Velvet" on principle alone-- this review is intended for people who have seen it, and thus contains SPOILERS.  David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" is that rare breed of film: an  unquestioned modern masterpiece, upheld by imdb geeks and  Entertainment Weekly-pop culture hounds as something truly  special. Everybody seems to like it, and everybody's got  their own reason. Some see it as allegory, some simply as a  living nightmare, some as genuinely effective drama, some as  a coming-of-age story.  I've seen "Blue Velvet" three times now. The first time, I  admit a prejudicial point of view-- I wanted to prove Roger  Ebert right in his criticism of it, because Ebert was my  hero at the time. I was unimpressed. Later, I returned to it  after a number of critics upheld it as  the genuine article. I'd seen Mulholland Drive and Lost  Highway, and loved both of them-- perhaps I was more  prepared for Lynchian weirdness this time around. Nope. I  was still unimpressed, although I was entranced by the  visual look of the film.  Recently, I found myself picking it up again, after  seeing Mulholland Drive with an artsy group of friends who  were convinced that they could explain everything that  happened in it to me, and pretty much did (except for the  blue box and the scene with the huge dude who knocks out the  director's wife). With an increased appreciation of Lynch, I  returned to what most consider his masterpiece, ironically  enough, prejudiced IN ITS FAVOR this time around.   Well, I'm still not impressed. "Blue Velvet" thinks it's so  damn cool and subversive. It thinks it's turning Americana  on its head by depicting sexual perversion behind white  picket fences. I don't think it's doing anything at all.  Granted, for forty minutes or so, "Blue Velvet" is compelling. From the opening scene to the discovery of the ear all the way up to  Dennis Hopper's unforgettable apperance and including the dream sequence afterwards, Lynch had me hooked. He seemed at that point to be ready to go for broke, to show us unimaginable horrors, to penetrate through to the  darkest aspects of human nature.  Yet something odd happens after the forty minute mark-- the story that we thought was gradually unfolding into something complex and sinister stops unfolding altogether. After forty minutes, we have all the plot we're going to get. We have a woman held in sexual slavery by a drug dealer who has kidnapped her husband and son, we have the naive college kid who tries to help her out, we have the sweet high school girl he's falling in love with, and that's all we have. Those expecting "Blue Velvet" to "go somewhere" from this point will be sorely disappointed.   In the end, "Blue Velvet" goes down an entirely conventional path towards its conclusion. Instead of exploring the Hopper character, Lynch makes him into a campy villain. Instead of exploring the Rosellini character, Lynch makes her into a conventional damsel in distress, longing after her husband and son. Instead of exploring Jeffrey, Lynch turns him into an uninteresting do-gooder. The latterchoice is particularly odd, given that Lynch has set him up to have his whole world turned upside-down-- yet he heroically takes everything in stride and saves the day.  Most egregious of all is the resolution of the plot, which  I've got to assume is intended as a joke on the viewer.  After all of Lynch's pretensions about inverting Americana,  he gives us a reaffirmation of it, in the form of a  conventional ending in which a simple act of violence  restores the natural order of things, the robins make  everything better, and, gee, everything's just great! Even  though I'm sure this is intended as ironic, I found myself frustrated anyway. If Lynch isn't going to take his art seriously, why should the viewer?  I don't want to seem like I'm making an attack on Lynch, although it may seem that way, as I'm criticizing his most canonized work. Lynch has proven that he is capable of taking himself seriously, and developing stories that go places-- even if they work with a logic that conventional films do not. "Blue Velvet," by contrast, goes nowhere and does nothing truly unusual or interesting in the process. I've endeavored to work my way around to enjoying it, but I can't. It simply is not interesting, as a dramatic work, or even as an abstract collection of images.   I would direct those who want to see Lynch at his best to "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me," "Lost Highway" (my personal favorite), and "Mulholland Drive." These are virtuoso films that see the director exploiting the most fearsome resources of cinema to lead his viewers on journeys that begin and end, with point and purpose. They are masterpieces, and no matter what anyone tells you, they make sense if you are willing to do the intellectual heavy-lifting.   Compared to these later works, "Blue Velvet" is positively forgettable. 
 I hope it's live because if it's memorex, it's crap!  that's my latest opinion after using this product.  I have a LiteOn SOHW-802S and it hates Memorex.  I rarely get a decent burn.  More often than not I'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it.  My movies will skip, stutter, or stop all together.  So disappointing!  Unfortunately I found out too late that Memorex uses CMC media, which only has a 0-50% success rate!  [... 
 A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company.  Really only suitable for watching in private 
 While Mr. Jacobs has some technical knowledge, there is a lack of everyday, practical techniques.To win a concours, you must also have an in depth knowledge of the judging for your class and how to knowledge of  paints and polishing.As a winner of several concours, I would recommend  this book only as a primer, but not the "secrets revealed" book I  had hoped for 
 I have to agree with other reviewers who call this the weakest link in the trilogy. Its tone is very different from "Out of the Silent Planet" and "Perelandra". Those stories were magical, this one was... bewildering. I think the key is that the other two books were timeless, and still work today; but this one is too focused on a time and place (British society and universities in the 1940s) for most of today's readers to be able to connect to. If you want to finish the trilogy, this is worth reading once; but be prepared for something totally different from the first two books 
 I must admit. I am not Kings biggest fan. I like the way he writes characters, but for years, I haven't been able to put my finger on why I don't like his books. After reading The Colorado Kid, I realized what it was. King is a lazy writer. He can tell a good story, but he doesn't follow through. His typical way out of a jamb is to make some inanimate object talk. Bleh. You can tell when he is done with a story. It just ends.  This book is no exception. The story rambles through the mouth of a clichï¿½d old time reporter teaching a young'un the ropes. King tells the story, he doesn't show it. I kept waiting for the narrative to stop and for the action to begin, but it never did.  And the ending! Someone, his editor, agent, family or friends, tell Mr. King that mysteries are supposed to be resolved. He doesn't resolve this mystery. That was the only reason, other than the fact that I had a 7 hour flight and nothing else to do, that kept me reading. I got to the end and I swear I almost tossed the book while on the plane. There is an after word trying to justify his ending. I didn't get past the first sentence. Authors don't write justifications for their books unless they know they are guilty of something.  If I could take away all the stars on this book, I would. Even one star is one too many. 
 Mark Bittman's "How to Cook Everything" is a treasure trove of vegeterian recipes, including tons of recipes for cooking legumes, grains, and vegetables. Unfortunately, those sections are all missing from "The Minimalist Cooks Dinner," which is essentially about cooking meat, poultry, and fish. Vegeterian Bittman fans would be better off sticking with "How to Cook Everything" and/or trying out "The Minimalist Cooks Vegetarian.&quot 
 This poorly researched book of straight up fabrications and quotes taken out of context has one thing right, some radical 60's leftists are trying to take over America, namely David Horowitz (former left-wing radical and Black Panther) and his band of 'former' socialists turned neos.  David doesn't even write this dribble, he just puts his name on it and hits the television machine and air waves.  If you've heard David talk about his book then you've heard all the best parts.  Media Matters ripped this book apart for its butchering of quotes by the likes of George Soros to state an arguement that could not exist without pure editorial manipulation.  It's been over a month and David has promised a 'full-blown' rebuttal to Media Matters findings but so far he's been unable to stretch the truth any further.    Wake up sheeple, David and Poe are coming for your children 
 DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!  Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't).  Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan 
 Based on the prior reviews, I fully expected to like these. Unfortunately, I don't, and won't buy more. They don't stay up. I don't have particularly large or small calves, and don't have that issue with my other athletic socks. Oh, well, buy and learn.  I bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing 
 I watched the movie DRIVING MRS DASIE with my mother and it had cooler cars than the ones in this movie.  It looked like the drivers stole these cars from the parking lot of the BINGO CLUB or a senior citizens house or something.  I didnt see a single tank of nitrous in the whole thing.  No subwoofers, no cop chases no anything a couple 25 ft long drag races that my mom probably could have one.  This is the worst video ever.  Anyone that gives it more than the worst rating possible only did it because they were either in the movie or because get some of the profit if it sells.  I cant believe I spent any money on this piece of junk.  DO NOT BUY IT, SPEND A COUPLE MORE BUCKS AND GET THE MOVIE MISCHIEF 3000. It has cars in it worth racing and it has police chases and hot frickin chicks. 
 Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed 
 This is not a book, but a rambling memoir filled with too many personal comments of little substance.  Do not expect an objective analysis as to the causes or the events surrounding the Kosovo conflict.  Nor expect a CLEAR or INSIGHTFUL book on how military decisions are made and executed.    Any value this book may have had in describing the decision making process between the US military and its political leadership was buried in the almost constant self complementary remarks 
 The very title for the book - "I Con" - despite its cleverness, should reveal the lack of any objectivity, or class for that matter, from the authors, Jeffrey S. Young & William L. Simon. I could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts, poor research, colored by a palpable disdain for [arguably the most interesting legend of our time] Steve Jobs.  What is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards Steve Jobs, seems 'personal'; which, in a democratic sense, may be alright i guess, [but only] UNTIL facts begin to wear thin, and the research seems doctored, leaving the rants sounding hollow, unsavory and shrill. And the facts aren't well-strung together either!  From the very opening description in the book, which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a "reformed" Steve Jobs, to Apple in 1997 (as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred), to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations, and quite often blatant slanders about Jobs, the book appears to be a collation of 'hate diaries' maintained by two wannabe authors, whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-Steve sentiment among its readers!  If you happen to be one of those people, who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering [especially Steve Jobs], then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy 
 it was the wrong book for a class i needed. Didn't even open it 
 There are several questions I have after listening to this CD.  Why are the tempos so crazy?  The opening number plods along like a funeral march, while At The Ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank.  Part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track.  Why does everything sound so thin?  These orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings.  On this CD, it's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life, sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound.  Sometimes, obviously live instruments sound like MIDI.  Usually it's the sound engineer's job to make the opposite happen!  Why are the vocals so "hot"?  In the OBC, there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra.  Now it's the vocals that tear at the balance.  Who cast this show?  I'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude, but -- oh screw it.  You deserve to know.  This Cassie is some serious vocal ugly.  I didn't once wonder along with Zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line, like I did with Ms. Donna McKechnie's fabulous triple threat.  Why not update some of the orchestrations?  I have a deep and abiding respect for Jonathan Tunick (who is among my top three favorite Broadway creative types), but it's 2006.  Wah wah pedals are out.  Overall, although this CD is good for completists, it's not going to knock the OBC recording out of it's slot as the definitive A CHORUS LINE recording.  If you don't have a Chorus Line CD and are trying to decide which one to buy, track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast.  It's vintage, but it has a raw warmth that is missing from the revival cast 
 There are three main reasons to why I did not enjoy this trilogy.  First, the story and overall flavor is a bit juvenile.  The first story in the trilogy is decent, but the latter two were simple and uninteresting.  Second, the main character of these stories is incredibly annoying.  A know-it-all, the book repeatedly showed how great the main character was in stark contrast to the rest of the characters who are portrayed as stupid, and well below the greatness of the main character.  Third, several things bothered me with the writing style of the books.  The author used a lot of words and phrases over and over again.  "Jason shuddered" must have been used at least two dozen times, trying to show how much smarter Jason was than the other characters.  Also, the second book tries to get philosophical and really does a poor job.  The author attempts to promote moral relativism, but does so in an overly obvious dialogue between two characters.  I appreciate philosophy in narrative, but it must be done well like CS Lewis and Arthur Clarke.  All this to say that the book is a disappointment, there are much better science fiction books out there to read 
 Very detailed but the author assumes you have read his books on the Celtic beliefs, jumps around between subjects quite often in an attempt to prove a vague concept, and overall made the subject quite a difficult read. On the other hand, the author is very accurate and detailed allowing for a mostly unbiased history 
 this is a horrible cd. fat boy slim has for a long time corrupted our music with his mainstream whorthless crap and ive had enough.  i sat buy idly until he remixed smells like teen spirit.  he ruined a perfect song and runed it into a worthless funk song. i think the populace should boycote his junk to purge the airways of tthis low level crap 
 Mcmurry is a colourful and over-generalized textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic. Mcmurry's style is to induce learning of 0-chem via memorizing of reaction mechanisms, and other trivial components.  The only reason you should buy this book (same reason I did) is if your o-chem course is based on this; that being, this is your prescribed text. It is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook. However this may not be the case for this edition of Mcmurry. Organic Chemistry by Wade has the same chapter format, covers essentially the same thing but treats  the fundamental principles with more depth; allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry.  One thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for IR frequencies of major functional groups, and mass spectra is barely covered. It is at best just mentioned...nothing more. Wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth...something which is essential in second year chemistry.  All in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics. When it discuses KMnO4 oxidatation, that at least should be a review of redox.   The chapters on Substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory, but it is the basics that are lacking. I would suggest for first time o-chem students to consult Wade and compare it to the writing style of Mcmurry. Albeit Mcmurry is very nice and colourful, you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry.  The book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in Australia, which suggests the severe lackings of this book. This has been inherent in it for the last three editions...Not too happy with it 
 This was one of the most boring movies on the topic. I watch lots of alternative films, foreign, offbeat, etc. And this is just not well written or developed.  There were some good scenes, but very disjointed. 
 I've had this coin purse not even 2 months now, and I've only used it about 7 times.  Unfortunately, the ZIPPER broke already! I couldn't believe it.  
 I'm glad I read this book for the subject matter, though there were so many problems with it I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. Cohen bases the book on the memories of old people, and some of their resistance efforts sound like pretty tall tales. I couldn't help but make the comparison with an 89-year-old gentleman I know who claims he sat on a purse snatcher until the police came. Some of the feats they credit themselves with accomplishing are simply unbelievable. There are also discrepancies. For example, Vitka is once called upon to bury a body in a forest in great haste, and I assume we're supposed to think she did it with her bare hands since she had no tools with her. Then much later in the story Vitka sees a dead body for the first time. Huh? Vitka, however, is the real heroine of the story, brave and selfless. Abba is an intriguing person, but my impression was that he gave the orders and took care of himself while his women did all the work. His fanaticism in later years was disturbing, though after what he lived through it is hard to judge him fairly. It's uplifting to know some Jews did fight back and that many lives were saved because of their courage, and that's the best part of the story 
 Not my cup a tea. Poor sound and average picture. Just for Excalibur freaks...?! 
 I hated this book!It was like a big lie. Nothing of what she mentioned really happened. I am Lebanese and I know all about Arab culture. This lousy book gives a very wrong impression about Arab culture, it is infact  nothing of what she mentioned.Even in war time, when Lebanon was devided  into Sharkiyyeh(Eastern part where all the Christians lived) and  Gharbiyyeh( Western part where all the Muslims lived)it was never like what  she wrote about. Even if it were to happen, it would happen to one in a  million. I wonder why she got so much attention over a lame book. To me it  was more like a lousy re-write of an American novel. Western people who  read this book PLEASE don't beleive it! Elle doit faire attention a ce  qu'elle ecrit 
 This is, by far, the worst vocal selections I've ever bought!  And I've bought a lot of bad ones!  I was in this show two years ago and had a fantastic time(I played Nicely-Nicely)!  So I didn't hesitate to order the music, but when it arrived I found the selections chopped beyond recognition!  And not only are they chopped, but they're also simplified!  This book should be marked "Easy Piano!"  If you're looking for a good rendition of this music, spend the extra $20 and buy the score 
 I would have to say that my first impression of this book was, "It's more like a 'Nancy Drew' story, just with a lot of sex." I honestly liked "Q" better than this, because it focused on a murder investigation, instead of some Byzantine financial crime that takes pages to explain and that many authors seem to be fond of anymore.   On the plus side, I'm glad that Kinsey has a new love interest, and am interested to see where that goes. On the minus side, while the senior citizens' love triangle is amusing, it adds nothing to a slow story that I had to force myself to finish. And another thing, didn't Henry's brother William (I think that's his name) give up the hypochondiacal behavior several books back?  Up through "G", these books were excellent murder mysteries. Then, starting with "H," the stories slowed down, and it seemed like the crimes were leaning more towards money laundering/pyramid schemes, than towards the formula that made this a good series.  I'd have to say that this story is for "hardcore" Kinsey fans only. It starts slow and stays that way.  Here's hoping that "S" will be better 
 I am just so sad to have this wonderful series end so badly.  I do not believe for a minute that Mrs. Braun is still writing these books and whoever is should STOP.  Polly gone, the barn burns and Qwill doesn't seem to care about either.  I will not accept the character of Barbara.  The worst thing of all is that I do not even like Qwill anymore! I will never read another and that is sad to me 
 Michael Mandel's book has laid an egg, but you can only understand why if you make the mistake of picking up this book and reading it. This same gent, who "predicted" the Internet depression (after it already happened) now seeks to burden us with the believe that all these hobgoblins out there are the "enemies of growth." But his arguments are unconvincing and poorly presented, in prose that is hackneyed and academic-dull 
 This cartrige never printed any color than red. even after cleaning many, many times! Will never buy another cartrige from them. paying twice the price for one that works is a better investment 
 Pros:  Bagless, works well at first  Cons:  Breaks down frequently, the tubes often become blocked despite emptying of the canister in a timely manner, burning rubber smell, and had to replace the belt-twice.  Right now my vacuum is sitting in the middle of the living room.  I want to vacuum, but I can't.  It is broken-again!  It isn't as if I use it all that often, so to have it break down so much is quite frustrating.  Don't waste your money on this cleaner. 
 If you, like me, have recently discovered this amazing writer recently you will be tempted to read his final words laid out in this book.  I however was a little disappointed.  The writing does not flow effortlessly.  He refers to a lot of names (politicians, artists, and writers, etc.) and places, but I'm afraid the majority of these references will only make sense to a European history buff.  In fact, much of the book will only hold the interest of a history student.  I had hoped the book would document HIS world of yesterday thoroughly--his motivations for writing particular books etc.--instead it goes into details about Europe far too much.  An OK read, but if you want to skip this one you won't be missing much.  Maybe his best work was far too good and this mediocre, long-winded good-bye pales against it 
 Maybe Mushroom head should worry less about their mask and image, and concentrate more on learning how to play a their instruments. I have never heard a metal band that was so horrid in my life. All Mushroom Head does is whine through every song with some easy power chords to go along with it. These guys are nothing that you havent heard a million times before, and they are just plain bad. How anyone can like this is beyond me, even if you love Nu Metal, there are so many bands from that genere that blow these guys out of the water. If you are aching for some good Nu Metal, then try Machinehead, Mudvayne, (older) Slipknot, or DevilDriver 
 It seemed like there were 2 articles & 80 pages of advertisements 
 I feel really bad for those poor students of Mr. Pearce who don't drop out of his class the first week.  This is the first book on public speaking that I've read where I honestly haven't taken anything from this book, and I've read about five.  He talks about all of the mechanics of public speaking, but something big is missing from this book.  Also, leadership via public speaking, which seems to be the titular topic of this book, is missing from the pages.  Mr. Pearce reminds me of one of my statistics professors.  This professor, which I'll call Mr. Banal, was a very smart person, had studied a lot, was up on the current statistics methodologies, and was a nice person.  However, Mr. Banal's lecture consisted almost entirely of an analysis of what he thought of the textbook.  Mr. Banal always had some new "insight"--which usually amounted to a very minor disagreement that he had with the author of the text.  He talked about this minor disagreement for the entire lecture hour.  I think that doing this allowed him to feel good about himself, because he was proving to the students that he was smarter than the author of the text.  This was really confusing to me.  Who should I believe, Mr. Banal or the author of the statistics text?  The author seemed a lot more interesting (which is funny considering the subject), but Mr. Banal was the one who ultimately would be testing me.  This is what Mr. Pearce does in his book.  He is constantly rewriting speeches of others into a "better speech."  A really funny example of this occurs during the end of the book, where he's quoting Anita Roddick, managing director of The Body Shop International.  Roddick is an excellent public speaker, and he quotes often from one of her speeches, which is probably the most interesting part of the book.  Toward the end, Mr. Pearce cherry picks a paragraph from her speech and reworks it.  The initial paragraph wasn't all that bad, but Mr. Pearce's "improved" version of it was terrible.  This is the same kind of difference between a sports commentator and an avid fan.  The sports commentator will describe the athlete, what the athlete did during the performance, and trace the effects of the athlete's performance.  This is very complex and requires a lot of skill.  The avid fan will say things like, "I would have done this...I would have done that."  This requires very little skill at all.  Mr. Pearce is the avid fan, telling us what he would have done, rather than actually doing anything himself.  It kind of seems like Mr. Pearce was writing this book for the dean of UC-Berkeley, rather than for the public 
 If you are familiar with the usual "messie" terms, I would say Ms. Barnes is "born organized". She talks about how she helped her mother from early on keeping up the house and a business. She  apparently was never at a "total mess". If you are completely  disorganized and don't know where to start, this book probably will not  help you. There are some sections on closets and the kitchen that give you  directions on organization 
 My mother got me this book as a gift...and it is a truly interesting idea for a book. This book lacks the charm of the "soup" books...most  of the stories are drawn out from the one sentence in which they could be  summarized. It seems as though Ford, in trying to solicit stories, accepted  the first 101 and did not edit or improve any submissions at all. Some of  the stories, granted, are interesting, engaging, and even a bit spooky.  Unfortunately, the majority seem contrived and more the fare of late-night  campfire chats or urban legends than genuinely inspiring stories of the  "other side". In future editions of this book (which I am sure  there will be), Ford could, should, and for her own integrity as a writer,  must be more selective in choosing her stories. And.. just *perhaps* she  could make the parody title a tiny, tiny bit less obvious 
 The book is about leading a company, not about the law of attraction. Although it may be a fine book for entrepreneurs, it is not a book on philosophy 
 This thing is a beast! It's difficult to read - the space between lines is so short, you feel like you're reading the same line over and over. The material repeats itself quite often - so much that the book could use some editing. I guess the authors get paid by the word. As a nursing student in an ADN program with absolutely no interest in the field of Pediatric Nursing, I resented having to lug this turkey around. I'm sure it's treasured by pediatric nurses and educators world wide, but if you've got to buy it, get a used one or an older edition. No need in breaking your bank account and your back 
 This is the worst children's book I've ever read. I am a teacher and have quite a range of knowledge of children's books. There is no moral to this story. The story starts out very pleasant and then there are 3 robbers with knives and guns. As if that isn't bad enough, they even hold the gun to Pearl's head!! There are 3 different scenes with them ~ it doesn't make sense. Then a Fox comes along and leads her to an abandoned house - With beer bottles on the front lawn!! It is truly an awful book. I teach High School English 3 and discussed the book with my students, some of whom are parents ~ they even agreed that it's not a book for children! 
 This book is full of eastern religious philosophy and has little to do with reaching your highest goal.  This book was assigned as required reading for an MBA program and I was extremely disappointed.  Even if the author is a well-known Stanford professor, I believe he's a yogi first.  Buyer beware! Needs to be -5 stars 
 With the talent involved in this film, I had high hopes.  But there's a reason why this western can't be found on any "great westerns" or "classic westerns" list: it's not very good.  On the plus side, it has some excellent location work in and around Death Valley, some great photography and some striking imagery.  The first 30 minutes are very good.  But it goes downhill after that, with a story that falls into total predictability and ridiculousness.  It's hard to root for the outlaws, and we don't see any redeeming qualities in Gregory Peck until far too late in the story.  By then, it's hard to care.  There's actually a scene where he explains to Anne Baxter and her grandfather that he's actually a decent guy -- this despite the fact that he's robbed a bank, is willing to let one of his own men die of thirst, and plans to steal all of Baxter's and her grandfather's gold!  Yeah, right!  The final gunfight is poorly staged with no suspense, and the denouement is beyond ridiculous.  There are dozens of fine westerns on DVD, but this isn't one of them.  Technically, the transfer is very good.  For special features, there are some still galleries, trailers for other films, but no commentary 
 When I finished reading this book I really didn't know what to think of it.  While reading it I constantly felt like I was reading a trashy romance novel with all the explicitly sexual imagery and at other times I found myself wondering if the plot was going to go anywhere at all.  The book is described as being a coming of age story of two best friends, but I think it is just a teenage pornographic novel.  I probably won't read this book again and even though it was only two hundred pages long, I feel that my time was wasted on this unsatisfying book 
 This is probably the most detailed account of PSI research in print. The style is slanted towards the popular with many anecdotal stories dispersed in it, but is also full of detailed accounts of one scientific test after the other, all rather amazingly showing that PSI phenomena exist. Everything is proved: telepathy? check, clairvoyance? check, precognition? check, telekinesis? check, mental healing? check, field consciousness? check. Does distance diminish the PSI effect? Nope. Time? Neither. Special people required? Mostly no, everybody can do it. Sounds too good to be true? Maybe.   Now the fact is that there have been hundreds of experiments performed under fairly careful research conditions for over half a century. Most of them detected statistical evidence in favor of the hypothesis of PSI. Meta-analyses of these results, i.e. analyses that take into account the data of several similar studies, result in overwhelming evidence in favor of the reality of PSI phenomena. The frustration of the author is palpable when he recounts that even so mainstream science does not take PSI at all seriously.   So what's going on? The author's thesis of course is that PSI is real and that the scientific status quo resists recognizing this fact because it upsets the accepted wisdom. I think another perhaps more likely explanation is this: PSI does not exist, but the more experiments you make the more reason you will find that it does, and this because the tests are not symmetrical: the deck of cards is slightly stacked in favor of PSI. Therefore most experiments will tend to show some small positive evidence, and a large number of such experiments will show statistically impressive results. Here is the asymmetry:   There are three possible results an experiment can show: If the result is close to the expected random value then PSI has not been detected; if the result is larger than expected then it counts as positive evidence for PSI, but if the result is less than expected then it proves there is an error in the experimental setup. In this latter case the researchers will certainly look for and correct that error, whereas when confronted with a positive result they will not always try as hard, assuming that they are observing evidence of PSI. This asymmetry may be slight, but is always there. Another asymmetry concerns the experiments related to the paranormal transfer of information. There is no such thing as negative leakage of information; only positive leakage is possible even in well designed experiments, and this will show up as a slight PSI effect. Finally there is the human factor that cannot really be completely factored away. Suppose that after a long and arduous experimental process some evidence in favor of PSI has been gathered and then, suddenly, a significant negative measurement is made that would ruin the statistics. It's conceivable that a tired assistant will think that he must have committed some mistake somewhere and decide to simply repeat this particular round. So I think it's fair to suggest that what the meta-analyses in this book measure is not the presence of PSI but the presence of this real world experimental asymmetry.   The book demonstrates this asymmetry in several places. In one case (page 171) a researcher investigates whether the weather at the graduations at Princeton University is really better than expected as the result of many people wishing for this. So he studies the weather data over a thirty year period and finds that, contrary to PSI, the weather on graduation day was a little worse in Princeton as compared to nearby towns. So he investigates this annoying negative result and discovers that the statistic is marred by only one case: heavy rain that fell on the day of the 1962 graduation. He investigates further and happily announces that it rained only after the graduation ceremony had ended. Well, he apparently did not investigate the other years at the same detail, and he certainly would not have investigated further if the result happened to be positive to begin with.  The main reason why I found this book unconvincing is that if PSI existed it would be easy to demonstrate. No meta-analysis of a huge number of studies is needed; one good experiment suffices. The test I found most impressive is also the simplest one: to have subjects mentally affect the result of random number generators. This experiment is easy and cheap to set up, is so simple that errors can easily be removed, and is easy to reproduce (the book claims that all subjects were successful in nudging the RNG outside of its operational parameters). If it works it would prove that PSI is real. The fact that PSI believers instead of concentrating on one simple experiment are instead all over the place describing results of disparate, old, and complex studies is a bad sign.  Another way to easily prove the existence of PSI would by using casino statistics. If there is one place where PSI should be present it is there. The author got some daily data about the money dropped and money won at different games such as roulette. If he had only gotten data about the number of roulette plays he could have easily demonstrated that the money won was more than expected thus demonstrating PSI. In the book he claims that casinos are reluctant to share such data, but I wonder why. If PSI were demonstrated it would a huge boon for the casino business. In fact casinos themselves could easily demonstrate PSI using their own people. Why hasn't any one casino ever done so? The only reasonable answer is because no PSI effect is to be found in their data.   So in conclusion, even this book did educate me about the arguments in favor of PSI and made me wonder and think about this issue, the net effect has been to strengthen my belief that PSI does not exist.  
 I read The New Money Masters after the Market Wizards and the New Market Wizards. When I saw "winning investment strategies of: Soros, Lynch, Rogers, etc etc on the front cover, I immediately bought it. Like any trader who jumps into the market without a plan or thorough study, I lost this trade. Train tried to portrait what's in those masters' minds but he failed. Even worse, his writing skill had been too bad for me to finish reading the whole book. Well, how am I supposed to expect something great from a 379 page book that carries 147 pages of appendix 
 As a fan of N. Farmer after reading The House of The Scorpions, I had grasped this book with enthusiasm.  Sadly, I now question my admiration towards the author.  This book, set in early saxon era, gives overly descriptive and frank and straight forward counts of the Norse people's heinous actions, without consideration of the ages of her readers:  page 105 - "The sad eyed woman collapsed.  She hadn't been strong to begin with.  Olaf dragged her up, and with a swift movement that made Jack cry out, he cut her throat and threw her over the side."  And, that's just a tip of the iceberg.  Try a search on "cut" within this book and you will find dozens of more of these decadent actions that I truly do not believe that a young person should be reading.    	In regards the characters, I have to agree with other one-star givers, that there are no character buildings within the story.  I did not see any special ability nor courage in Jack, who was chosen to the bard's apprentice.  His sister, Lucy, is a retard - thinking the Norsemen who captured them are some king's men who came to take her back to be a princess.  Thorgil, who is one of the "shield maiden" is absurdly defiant - how she still survived the odyssey, is outrageous.  And, of course, Olaf - whose suicidal downfall was inevitable in a battle with an invincible opponent called a troll-bear.    	Only good part I see in this book is how the author tried to weave and bestows the knowledge of Norse mythology upon the readers.  The book is crammed with trolls, Asgard, Jotuns, Freya and etcetera.  It is filled with good knowledge.  Yet, the storytelling is very hectic.  Surroundings and atmospheres are left undescribed.  The novel bounds along with hiatus leaving to wonder as if this book should have been a trilogy where many sections seem detracted to fulfill the publisher's encumbrances rather than the author's artistry to shorten a potentially a greater novel to a mere kiddies' read.  	To fulfill the knowledge of Norse mythology, I would recommend "D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths"  
  It was probably brave to make any sort of a film out of Rudi van Danzig's book. Doubtless the controversial part of the subject matter of this film, an 11/12 year old boy part-willingly seduced by a 19 year-old soldier, was the reason that it was awarded the Best Film and Audience Prize at Turin in 1993. It cannot have been for any artistic merit or general craft competence. When Jeroen and his mother emerge from their flat we are expected to believe that this is Amsterdam after more than 4 years of Nazi occupation and deprivation. The flats and street are in immaculately good condition. The children being packed off to Friesland so that rest of their families shan't starve are pictures of good health. Was the budget for this film so pathetically low that the producers could not drive around The Netherlands coastline to find a village for the arrival of the Canadian liberators where there weren't bollards on the footpaths to stop people parking cars there? Doubtless McDonald's was just around the corner. I laughed. I thought of Monty Python.  As to the main topic of the film, the relationship between the soldier and the boy, do not expect this to remain totally from the child's perspective as it is in the book; there are trite lines of self-explanation from the soldier. The book quite believably develops the relationship between the child and the man, the film doesn't. Since the film is only 92 minutes long perhaps the answer is a censor's sharp scissors, not an example of the film-makers' overall artistic failure. Or perhaps they just hadn't got enough money for enough scenes.  The small, redeeeming part of the film is the depiction of the devoutly Protestant people of this ultra-provincial part of The Netherlands; I believed this representation. In this the film shares it's small success with another poor film set in an extreme end of a maritime country, which relies on sex to get people to watch it, "Breaking The Waves".  Do not expect this film to bear more than a passing resemblance to van Dantzig's book. Do not expect to see a work of art. Don't waste your money on this DVD; instead, if you haven't done so already, buy the book 
 The action starts in Edwardian England, and it spans from January 1901, one day after Queen Victoria's death, to the day of Edward's death in May 1910.  Everything starts with two families from different walks of life who visit their family's graves, which happen to be next to each other. The Coleman's grave is decorated with an urn, which becomes a symbol of their beliefs and modern social views, while the Waterhouses's grave is ornate with an angel representing their traditional beliefs. Their daughters of similar age, the quiet Maude Coleman and the spoiled Lavinia Waterhouse start playing together around the graveyard and meet one of the digger's son, Simon Field. Their lives are linked closer even more when the Waterhouses move next door to the Colemans.  The story revolves around the graveyard and its diggers and director, John Jackson, between the Coleman and Waterhouse families, and between traditional and modern views applied to their lives.  The girls become good friends and grow up together, but their lives revolve around the graveyard and their friendship with Simon. Society also changes little by little, with suffragetes's movement pushing for more liberties for women. Kitty Comeman, Maude's mother, after an abortion about which her family knows nothing, decides to be part of the movement and throws herself completely into it neglecting her duties to he family. Her decisions and those of Gertrude, Lavinia's mother, who wants to be different front Kitty, although she secretly admires, envies and despises her at the same time, change their family's lives irremediably during the first suffragettes public meeting.  The narrative is told from the point of view of different characters, even from that of the Colemans's maid and cook. Thus, the multiple perspectives endevour to add to the story, bring details about the characters telling the story and about how they view what is happening around them and to the others.  Expecting a "subtle" novel, I was on the watch for linguistic irony, for hidden meanings, use of symbols, etc. But I was quite disappointed. I do not know how her other novels are, but this one almost put me off from reading others bearing Tracy Chevalier's signature. 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 I prefer the book Art of Chainmail by Dylon Whyte. Available from The Art of Chainmail by Dylon Whyte website or Spider Chains website. In the book by Dylon Whyte, the illustrations are beautiful renderings from a 3D program, with great colour contrast that is easy to understand visually. The information and directions are clearly written and super easy to understand. The author is available by email and is very informative and helpful. It's probably the best book available on this subject. 
 Immature... smug... arrogant yet insecure. It's really hard to sympathize with a character who is so completely self-absorbed, bitter and judgemental. What were her redeeming qualities?   It sounds like I'm alone in this, but I found it hard to relate to her -- it really seemed that she was unloved throughout most of the story because she was ... unlovable.   
 I wanted to like "Star Trek III," but it was bogged down by a thin plot-line, weak action, a story that was too interpersonal between the principles, over-the-top humor, some scientific/technical absurdities and weaker special effects than the two previous "Trek" movies.  A story based solely on finding Spock's body and putting the spirit back into it, is just too interpersonal and small a story for the big screen.  A big screen "Trek" movie should involve a larger set of circumstances involving Starfleet and others in the galaxy.    Scotty sabotages the Excelsior's warp engines so they wouldn't be able to pursue the Enterprise when Kirk steals it from spacedock.  Once outside spacedock, the Enterprise goes to warp one (with light streak effects very inferior to those of "The Motion Picture") from an almost standing still position.  No more having to first go from warp point one to warp point nine, before you can achieve warp one, as it was in TMP.  Welcome to the subsequent "Trek" movies where even if you're standing still, just push one button and you're off to ludicrous speed in a flash.  The Excelsior pursues and tries to go to warp drive, but konks out due to Scotty's sabotage.  It then immediately comes to a complete stop (which would not happen in space), but it first makes a sound like a car breaking down.  Oh, what a knee-slapper.  Humor in Star Trek is fine, but not spoof humor.  That should be reserved for movies like "Airplane."  And the Enterprise is being operated solely by Kirk, Scotty, McCoy, Sulu and Checkov, when it normally requires a crew complement of hundreds.  Well, I guess it was all about forgetting serious sci-fi, just do whatever you can to appeal to the casual movie goer and the non-"Trek" fan.  And the action in "Search" was few and far between.  And unlike TMP, it didn't really compensate with any kind of intellectual journey or many interesting things to look at.  Well, buy if you must, but the problems with this movie all tie in to the unfortunate direction the "Trek" movies went in after TMP.  They should've stuck with real sci-fi and exploration, which is one of the main things Star Trek is supposed to be about.             
 When this book arrived after ordering it from Amazon (and being fooled by other reviews), my husband and I couldn't stop laughing--this is not an encyclopedia but a pocket sized dictionary (literally 2inches squared), with entries such as "ants"--the descriptions of anything are way too short to be of any merit, and if you really need to look up the definition of "ant" you are going to need a lot more help in your garden than this book can supply!!  The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is the shock-value I had when I received it--and a good laugh is always worth something.  In place you might consider Nancy Bubel's "Seed Starting Handbook"--lots of useful, easy-to-follow, and fairly detailed information on gardening 
 Is there anything more destructive to a movement than a sense of historical inevitability?  Just ask the Soviets, every time they screwed up they told themselves don't worry, our triumph over capitalism is inevitable, Marx said so.  I fear in this last election the Dems had a milder case of the same illness, a conviction that demographic changes would benefit them no matter what they did or said.  It didn't work out that way.  I first bought this-- in hardcover, alas-- just before the 2002 elections.  It seemed like a bad joke then, but I started reading it again just before this election, which saw the Republicans take control of the White House, both houses of Congress, a majority of governorships and everything but the Lake Tehachapi Water Authority, apparently.  It proved to be more than a bad joke-- there is a lot of good analysis here, some of which supports their trendlines for the Democratic party gaining ground demographically, but the authors are apparently blind to the fact that every three sentences they are forced to say something like: "Although Reagan did win 84% of the vote in the Democratic stronghold, that was due to the one-time effect of new processed cheese regulations, and the overall trend remains powerfully Democratic."  After a couple of chapters you've heard so many apologies and excuses that it's a bit of a joke-- the relentless upward sweep of the Republicans since 1964 is a series of flukes, while the narrow victories of Bill Clinton-- put into office twice only because Ross Perot ran to his opponent's right, splitting the majority right-- are proof of the dominance of the Democratic party.  Underneath all this there may well be some demographic truth.  But it will take some serious soul-searching on the part of the Democratic party to take advantage of it, and this book offers excuses, not a roadmap 
 THE CARS HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 1 DECENT SONG IN BYE BYE LOVE. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST PLAIN SUCK. I MEAN WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE LOUSY BANDS IN QUEEN, CARS, ACDC, BEATLES, STONES, WHO, STEVE MILLER, AND BOSTON? GOOD BANDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, GUNS N' ROSES, NIRVANA, GREEN DAY, AEROSMITH, AND JOE WALSH. DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE COMPILATION. GO GET A BETTER ALBUM FROM NIRVANA INSTED. PS THE CARS SUCK 
 This book is like walking into the Pottery Barn store, so this should be a catalogue instead of an ideas book. Lots of white. The bathrooms are comfortable looking, but not very original. I got more out of Japanese Bath book than this one 
 This book isn't really about arms and armor-- it's about weapons. If you are looking for a book that is compleatley about arms and armor, then find another book, but if you want a book that is about the history of weapons, then this is the book for you. I was looking for arms and armor, and this book didn't really have that much information on it 
 A better book in this price range is John H. Tullock's Natural Reef Aquariums, which seems to me to be based on Julian Sprung's work.  Or, spend more and get the bible of marine aquariums: The Reef Aquarium three volume set by Julian Sprung and Charles Delbeek.  The authors are well respected, their books are very detailed, and they have a more polite attitude toward the reader 
 This poetry has no redemption or beauty. It is dry, sarcastic, dismal, and plain out unhealthy to the mind. It's not worth it. Read poetry that moves you to understanding, not this 
 I was pretty excited to read this book.  I found Rosamund to be a great read .  Until You was somewhat lacking but Phillipa takes the cake.  I found it to be boring from page 1.  I just couldn't get into it.  It was also very drawn out.  Ms. Small's earlier books had more steam to them.  I don't think this is true about her later books. Hopefully the 4th one in the series will be much better 
 A couple of days ago I depressed the switch to begin toasting a piece of sliced bread, when all at once a blue flash jumped out at me, thus causing the demise of my applicance. I now realize I paid far too much for this unsafe piece of junk that lasted about two weeks short of a year 
 After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price).  
 I studied from this book for weeks and never improved on the assessment exams. With one day before test day, and in a bit of a panic, I threw the book in the waste basket and purchased the Rita Mulcahy text which had been recommended to me repeatedly. The one day I spent with the Mulcahy book was worth more than the 60 days I spent with the Heldman text for the following reasons:  1. The Heldman book does not follow the same format as the PMBOK. I at first considered this an advantage as I thought the different format would help my brain learn the material in a different way. This theory did not prove true. The Mulcahy book follows the same format as the PMBOK.  2. The chapter assessments and practice exam questions are confusing and there are bugs in the software that cut off some of the questions and answers. I assumed the format was indicative of how confusing the questions would be on the actual exam. This turned out to not be the case and in retrospect I wonder if the questions were scored correctly at all. The questions I saw on the exam were much more closely aligned with the format of the questions in the Mulcahy book.  3. The Mulcahy book includes additional exercises and "games" that will prepare you for the exam very well.   Do not buy this book 
 I just received these.  They're not flash cards.  A flash card has a question (images, etc) on one side and answer(s) on the other.  These cards just have info on both sides.  They're review cards, not flash cards 
 This book took me forever to read because it was extremely slow-paced and uneventful. The idea of poltergeist attacks sounded interesting to me but this book focused more on the sour relationships between the Democrats and Republicans in office than the acutal poltergeist attacks (which were more of a side note). I also found the character of Bishop Blackie to be rather annoying. Perhaps though, I just do not like political novels 
 Ok, I imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but I am going to say it anyway.  This little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  You need a wireless router!!  So rather than just complain, let me tell you what I want Canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution!   With CF cards in the 12GB range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (I know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16MP that shoot in JPEG & RAW on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.  WHAT I WANT is a bluetooth compact flash card. They make these so I know it is possible.  I would like Canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that I can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  Now that would make it so that when I am in the studio or shooting a wedding, I have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and I don't have to drag along a wireless router and I saved myself $700.  Get to it Canon - I am waiting!!! 
 **1/2  In "Hitch," Will Smith plays a modern-day Henry Higgins, who, for a tidy fee, will teach lessons of love to a bunch of lovelorn Eliza Doolittles - only, in this case, the Elizas are grown men who desperately need instruction on how to win the hearts and affections of the women of their dreams. Of course, the irony is that Hitch doesn't adhere to his own formula, being a confirmed bachelor with no interest in entering into a serious relationship with anyone himself. Until, that is, he meets the woman of his own dreams, Sara, a New York City gossip columnist who has no idea what it is Hitch does for a living.  It occurs to me that, when it comes to certain movie genres - action movies and romantic comedies in particular - it would be helpful if we could inflict some kind of temporary amnesia on ourselves so that we could at least think we were watching something new and fresh and not something we've already seen a hundred times before. Even the best romantic comedies can't entirely avoid paying homage to "the formula," and "Hitch" is clearly no exception. As such, the film has some mildly amusing moments, some endearingly sweet scenes, and some cute little plot complications amidst all the sentimental clichï¿½s, lowbrow slapstick and tired stereotypes we generally find in these films. (I mean, do we really need yet another romantic comedy in which one of the heroine's co-worker sidekicks is a light-in-the-loafers, preposterously effeminate gay man?). It seems like every time "Hitch" is about to win us over, it short circuits itself and loses us by going for the obvious.  Smith makes for a smooth romantic lead, but Eva Mendes doesn't always seem up to the challenge of her role, particularly when she is called upon to convey dramatic intensity. Actually, of the performers, it is Kevin James ("King of Queens"), as an overweight klutz who has hired Hitch's services to help him woo a beautiful blond heiress, who walks off with the film. Even though he's only a supporting player, it doesn't take him long to assume center stage in the film, essentially relegating the leads to second banana status.     
 While Divorcing the Dow highlights some tried and true criteria for selecting individual equity investments, e.g. to focus on leading companies that dominate vital growing sectors of the economy, it also falls prey to a "new logic" approach that can be very misleading, especially to beginning investors.  Worse, the authors don't understand a fundamental rule of financial arithmetic.  On page 162 they discuss a hypothetical investment manager that turns a portfolio worth $100,000 into $200,000 in one year, and then loses half that value the next, resulting in an end year value of $100,000.   The authors suggest that the "average return" from this is 25% (the arithmetic mean of +100% and -50%).  Clearly, if we began and ended with the same dollar value, the average annual return is 0%, which is the result calculated by the geometric mean, the correct method to use in computing growth rates.  A 25% average annual return on $100,000 would result in a portfolio value after two years of $100,000  X (1.25^2) = $156,250.   The authors and their editors should know better.  In my opinion readers would be far better served by such classics as The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel, or Contrarian Investment Strategies, by David Dremen 
 My husband and I are both college educated and can't figure this game out for the life of us.  Not only are the directions confusing but the game itself is cheap and flimsy. The only time we play it (which is very rare) is when we "make up" our own rules.  Please don't waste your money 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 I admire anybody who can put a comic together, although I'm not an avid comics reader (SIN CITY remains my favorite series). That said, recent NPR, boing-boing and Entertainment Weekly reviews have raved about this sereis, prompting me to look into it. Alas, more than halfway thru book one I am at a loss to understand the glittering praise that has been heaped on this work. The premise is intriguing (if a bit far fetched), but the writing is awful. Infantile gimmicks and coincidences abound, and horrible dialog assaults your eyes and insults your intelligence in every panel. The drawnig is generic and un-memorable, but it isn't as bad as the writing. Maybe it gets way better later, but my experience is that the odds are against it. If this is an exceptional contemporary comic, lord protect us from the rest of the lot 
 The mere fact that this album is popular is enough of an argument for letting terrorists bomb this country into oblivion.  The Black Eyed Peas have re-defined what awful music can sound like.  These guys have zero talent and zero class 
  Hard to believe it has been ten years since Load came out. Like many Metallica fans I recoiled against it, not because of the songs per say, but the whole image change, the shock of Metallica being on Lollapalloza, the disgust at seeing the arrogant attitudes displayed by Hetfild and Ulrich towrds Metallicas established fan base and the genre of heavy metal in general.It was too much for many people to take, and they rejected Load right then and there.    That said, with 10 years passing by, one can listen to Load is a clear eye(or ear). The fact is that while Load is not up to the previous standards of Metallica, it isint all that bad of an album, and despite the dramatica image change, it isint "alternative", either. What Load is more or less is Metallicas interpertation of 70s style blues based hard rock/metal. Think Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Sad Wings of Destiny era Judas Priest, Deep Purple, Budgie, UFO and Thin Lizzy. It are these influences that are most heard in Load. The mid temp, chunky riffs, the wah-wah pedal drenched solos, simple 4/4 based arrangements. Certarinly a big change from the agressive and also progressive nature of previous Metallica albums(even the Black album still had agressive and progressive influences).    The problem with why Load doesnt work per say is mainly two fold. One, at 80 minuites, there is quite a bit of filler on it. The hard rock/metal groups in the 70s worked with a 45 minuite frame work at the very most when it came to LPs, Load would have been a double LP, and the number of successful double LPs in any genre of rock can be counted on by one hand(the only one I can think of in the hard rock/metal genre is Led Zepplins Physical Graffiti). The filler material really weights the album down. The other problem is the bland, mid range production that Bob Rock gave the album that robbed the guitars of their power.    Some of the songs despite the production shortcomings have held up fairly well over the last 10 years. Songs such as King Nothing, 2X4, Bleeding Me, Aint my [...], Torn Within, the Outlaw Torn and Wasting My Hate are fiarly solid. The problem is the rest of the material is not solid, and still has the lifeless sound. Had Metallica only released one instead of two LOADS, had Metallica had better, more lively production, and had Metallica taken the better tracks off ReLoad such as Fuel, Devils Dance, Unforgiven II and Where the Wild things are, then it very well may have been a near great CD(think 4 stars or A- grade), but alas, Metallica went a different route, and the Loads are still considered a failure overall.    I do not reccomend fans of hard rock/metal purchase the entire Load CD, but the individual tracks I listed for Ipod make for decent rotation material 
 I just saw this movie and would only buy the book if 80 million dollars was at stake. I am a woman, an attractive and intelligent woman and I am completely alienated from his "vision". He portrays only the  Cathy Guisewite view of womankind and all woman should chase him down and  put wasabi on his oily, phony, grotesquely malformed testicles. I have  never been so repulsed by another human.I imagine htis review is not  suitable in that I did not suffer it in book form but I feel the need to  warn the inoccent 
 Oh, no. I can't believe I wasted my time reading this.  I want to throw up. NO, No, no.  At the beginning the storyline seemed interesting, but toward the end it just got worse and worse until I wasn't really sure what was going on. Ugh. Oh, well. 
 Bobby's voice as with all others has lost the range he used to demonstrate. This is not the worst case of a "re-do" I have had the displeasure of hearing, but it still is far short of the original offerings of Bobby during the 60's. As a courtesy to all involved, Be aware these are not all of his original recordings. Buyer Beware! 
 Though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one, the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by OBs.   At one point, the author actually defends episiotomies... she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her, and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth. It was both infuriating and saddening.  If you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little, this is cute. If you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!  
 This movie is more a curiosity than a "chef d'oeuvre" (French for masterpiece) of erotism. It hasn't aged very well either... It may have been a hit then, because it was one of the first of its kind - although I am not sure.   Coming from my fellow French men, I was expecting a more sensual and passionate love story rather this 2 hours of voyeurism and sadomasochism. I found the movie rather boring, expect maybe for a few scenes. The total exploitation of a young woman for sex and pleasure will be very disturbing to some. 
 I agree in part with the reviewer that has given 1 star to this book. I have not finished this book yet, and in fact I bought this book because of the numerous 5 stars reviews.  Many definitions appear only after they are mentioned in the text, so that perhaps you need to read and reread for this book to be useful.   
 I have just finished reading Styron's book Darkness Visible and I have to say that I was quite under whelmed. The reader is left with little insight into Styron's battle with severe depression. Maybe this is just me, but I find that writers seem capable of expressing their feelings of despair and suicide in only in the loftiest of literary terms. Their writing screams, "I'm famous, well respected and admired, therefore I cannot express myself the way that an ordinary person would. That would be too plebeian." That and the frequent name dropping made me feel alienated from the author. For this reason the reader gets no clear understanding of the nature of his depression. We get glimpses but don't feel privy to his deepest thoughts. In fact, I cannot fathom why he even wrote the book. It certainly doesn't speak to the common people - especially those of us who have spend our lives trying to get the mental health system to advocate for us. Many of us are treated more like criminals than someone with a disease that needs adequate treatment - something that is not going to be found in the state mental health institutions in which the ordinary person is held.  Styron's recovery is almost an afterthought. After spending weeks in a psychiatric hospital (I would guess McLean), he is cured. How is he cured - time. Give the illness enough time and the patient will get better. Actually, in my own experience as someone with severe depression with multiple suicide attempts, the passage of time does place a barrier between my suicidal thoughts and my recovery. But time alone does not cure - it postpones. On page 75 (soft cover) Styron states, "Save for the awfulness of certain memories, acute depression inflicts few permanent wounds." Well, bully for him. But I think that he would find most depressives in disagreement with this statement. At least for myself, my depression has left deep wounds for the past 30 years or so.  Apparently, this was Styron's only episode of depression and thoughts of suicide (unless he has relapsed since this book was published). He attributes the causes of his depression to the loss of his mother, his father's illness, abstaining from alcohol (alcohol and mental illness are not a good mix and only worsen a person's symptoms), and turning 60. It's great that he can pinpoint so precisely the origins of his illness. For many people depressed and suicidal we just can't point to the causes of our illness. As research on the brain advances, we know that chemical imbalances in the brain have a lot to do with many mental illnesses. But ask someone who attempts suicide why they wanted to hurt themselves and many times your answer will be, "I don't know - I just don't know."  On page 76 he states, "Most people in the grip of depression at its ghastliest ..... may require on the part of friends, lovers, family, admirers [!], an almost religious devotion to persuade the sufferers of life's worth, which is so often in conflict with a sense of their own worthlessness, but such a devotion has prevented countless suicides." In my experience and that of others, family and friends have no clue as to how to help a person in so much pain. They want to help and be supportive but they don't know how. And who can expect them to? Yes, having support is gratifying but in the end not as helpful as one would hope. For myself, "such devotion" has never stopped me from hurting myself or attempting suicide. When the despair is so great and the spiral down into the abyss is impossible to climb out of, thoughts of family, friends, loved ones are completely absent from my mind. They're gone - insignificant. The only hope is that someone or something can grab my hand and pull me out of that bottomless hole.  Also lacking insight is Styron's statement on 77. He writes about a camaraderie with a celebrated [what else would we expect from Mr. Styron's coterie of friends and admirers] newspaper columnist and good friend who was manic depressive. Because of the commonality of their illnesses, they have "engender[ed] lasting fellowship." So hey, one of the perks of those feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, despair, anguish and pain is that you might be lucky enough to find yourself a good friend.  This is the first time that I have read an account of a man's experience with mental illness. It is not my intention to sound sexist, but my experience in reading women authors writing about their battles with mental illness is that they are much more candid and forthright. I suppose that Styron's stilted and abbreviated account of his recovery from depression could just be the difference in which the opposite genders express their innermost thoughts. 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 I was excited to FINALLY find a black nursing bra.  This bra fits horribly.  Do not buy if you are DD/E cup!  This bra is uncomfortable and doesn't hold your goods properly 
 I kept falling asleep when I read this book. Although the author stresses that it's just a preliminary glimpse at the entertainment industry, I think he could at least make it more fun to read. I felt like I was reading a dictionary. 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 I was pretty disappointed with this book. Aimed at the complete novice looking to venture in to portraits for the first time, the information and is basic and uninspiring. 
 I just want to say, do not judge the author by this book.  I loved Ugly Duckling and many of her romance novels, but this one was terrible.  The hero of the novel starts out being strong and interesting, but for no aparent reason turns into a spineless idiot.  Bess, the heroine, acted like a selfish, hypocritical child and was never once brought to task for her stupidity.  She spends half of the novel blaming Kaldack for risking her life for the good of many, but spends the entire novel risking not only herself but everyone else for more selfish motives.  As the bodies pile up as a result of her actions, she never acknowledges any culpability.  I completely agree with every bad review that has been written 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 I had to read this book for an AP class, and it put me to sleep everytime i picked it up.  The author rambles on about the same things that went on in her life throughout the whole book, and she adds the most pointless details and situations.  The whole book is base don her views and opinions, so I really didn't care for it .If you don't want to go to the store to buy sleeping pills, just pick this one off the shelf and you will sleeping like a baby 
 ... the extended version of the film has some serious problems. I bought this dvd after waiting years for a more complete version to come out. Sadly side two of this single disc release has some serious errors. Around halfway through the film my copy would pause for a few minutes, eventually skip forward, pause,play, pause, skip forward, and then it would eventually play normally with a few more pauses. After looking online I found that this problem seems to be very common due to how the disc was made. So to wrap this up, I'm a fan of the movie, but this DVD is sold to you broken thanks to Universal Studios messing it up 
 I too thought that since we had such great luck with Avent bottles, that we would love their "magic" cups. I am constantly cleaning up leaks from these cups.  It seems like the lid and cup don't seal together well enough to withstand any activity. I'm sad to have to give Avent a bad rating, but don't waste your money on these cups 
 Livingstone makes a very good case for the known fact that the assassination was a conspiracy, carried out and covered up with the assistance of the highest of government officials.   However, there were aspects of this book which I found quite disconcerting. Livingstone makes some bold statements, most of which I happen to believe, but only because I've researched this subject for the last 30 years, and consider myself somewhat of an expert. But perhaps the most disconcerting element is the fact that he spelled Lyndon Baines Johnson wrong. Yes wrong, and this places into jeopardy the credibilty of his further statements. In the book, Baines, the correct spelling, was spelled Baynes.     Before reading this book, I suggest, if unfamiliar with the case and its players that one read either "JFK The Second Plot" or "Crossfire" or another book on the subject. You need to be familiar with the people involved because this book will not help you to decipher who they are or their backgrounds. Further, unfortunately, Livingstone skips all over the place inserting non topical information into a chapter which is devoted to a particular topic. It is stream of conscious writing and this makes it difficult to follow unless very well versed on the case.  I have read all of Livingstone's other books on this subject. He is perhaps the foremost authority, which by its very nature makes this a book worth purchasing and reading. But be ready to try following a "Superball" in a closet because it is that frustrating. If he did not have a ghost writer, he should have, and if he did they did an awful job.      
 I ordered the book new.  It arrived with dented/chipped corners and a slightly torn spine on hardcover. I assumed it was new but slightly damaged from storage or shipping.  Three weeks into the college term I am discovering highlighting already in the book. I feel ripped off 
  I regret buying this product since day1 u have to reboot it again and again and now atlast after 6 months only it died on me 
 Killsuck was an awful band from day one, but somehow they keep getting worse and worse.  If you thought their other albums were emo-laden, this makes "The End of Heartache" look like Morbid Angel's "Altars of Madness" for cryin' out loud!!  In other words, it's a metalcore album from metalcore band #391084309184230482048204830, so don't go near this and go for Morbid Angel, Suffocation, Cynic, and DRI for real metal.  Of course, my annoying little friend I Shalt Become [A C0rnh0le Victim] will give some stupid comment about how I'm "not metal" or say "durr, Krisiun is mallcore."  As usual, I'll just laugh at his stupidity and move along 
 Yes, Jordan writes well, uses words and descriptions beautifully. One of the many glowing blurbs on the dust jacket described it as "elegiac" and it certainly is, but elegiac only takes a book so far.  Beyond that, you need interesting characters that the reader cares about, set in a story that moves with a compelling narrative.  Perfect example, ATONEMENT.  Sadly, SHADE joins the pile of books I put down after wading through more than 100 pages. I could not finish it even though I was trapped on a long airplane flight with nothing else to read 
 Ms Strossen's book makes for boring reading. Her sole argument, as one  might expect, is this: individual freedom at all cost no matter how much it  might hurt a given community or someone's dignity. Now, I cannot see how  this has any meaning to real life 
 O livro é realmente fraco. Os assuntos são abordados sem profundidade, a qualidade dos desenhos não é das melhores.  Mas, como a produção de livros relacionados ao tema quadrinhos é escassa, tente 
 I won't get into a political discussion, although I disagree strongly with his beliefs.  Nevertheless, one thing about this book that agitated me was the complete lack of sources.  For example, Horowitz claims that shortly before his death, Huey Newton stated he shot John Frey in an interview to strike back at the white establishment.  Fair enough - but if you want to find the interview, Horowitz isn't going to give you any information whatsoever as to the location of it.  The same holds true for a similar claim that Jerry Rubin admitted that he deliberately stirred up trouble at the DNC in '68 to provoke a riot.  Fine.  Where can we find this interview?  Well, we can't, at least not according to Horowitz's book.  How am I supposed to respect a man who violates a cardinal rule of journalism (I am aware that this is a biography; that doesn't invalidate the fact that sources should be cited when necessary)?  Is he merely forgetful or are the interviews he cites non-existant or, under scrutiny, do they simply fail to uphold the claims he makes 
 I would first like to address Nietzsche's work itself, but before I begin, I should say that I feel that I have an open mind for works like The Anti-Christ. After reading the short book however, I am amazed that Nietzsche is given more than a cursory seat in history.   The Anti-Christ is supposed to be a critique of Christianity. In effect it is a critique of Nietzsche. He rarely backs up his assertions in any way. At one point, he begins to talk about how Jews are corrupting the world, boldly assuming that it is common knowledge that Jews are inherently evil and deceitful people. Frankly, I am not interested in having someone tell me that "Jews are evil," I want them to tell me why. Nietzsche does very little of this. In fact, the main arguments that he makes for his assertions are usually based on ad hominem libel. Essentially his writing has very little substance. It's like listening to 95% of the population tell you why they didn't vote for Kerry or didn't vote for Bush (Nietzsche could have written something like that). My final complaint is that Nietzsche's depth of analysis and understanding is very shallow. It's hard to fully explain what I mean by this in a short review but if you read the book you will understand (I hope). Most of his precepts are just very juvenile and can be thought away very quickly.  In the case of the translation, I am also dissapointed. I have no problem with the fact that Mencken is just as deranged as Nietzsche (a statement akin to many of Nietzsche's), he just can't spell. This book is fraught with misspellings. In total honesty, I have never read any sort of published material that contained so many misspellings. After 20 misspellings you have to wonder about the quality of the book you are reading.  If you want to know Nietzsche, The Anti-Christ is the place to start, but I can imagine why anyone would harbor any such desires. I should also say that it is possible that I am not one of the intellectual elite or "free spirits" that Nietzsche refers to in his works. It is possible that if Nietzsche spawned right in front of me today, he might inform me that I am just one of Earth's morons. In that case, kindly ignore this review because I am an idiot 
 The writing is good from a technical standpoint (I don't have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well).  The idea is a good one too.  What I can't get past is the character Robert Langdon.  Langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second.  Another thing I have trouble with is Dan Brown's knack for slowing the pace of the story.  Things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense.  The problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff.  Like playing fetch with a dog, you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest, especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it's finally tossed.    This book is an easy read but I think it is a bit over-rated.  
 Rarely have I felt ripped off after reading a book, but Konstantinos managed to make me feel that way.  What he offers in this book is a pseudo-scientific approach to the topic of vampires, one that reads like a high school paper that I doubt would garner a C.  He starts off by redefining the term vampire, one that in common parlance refers to an immortal blood drinker who can't face the sunlight or get destroyed, to include mortals who drink blood. I don't know about you, but as for me, a human who drinks blood is someone who I would not label as "vampire" but as "in need of some professional counselling."   Later he presents letters from what he describes as "possible vampires". Several of those letters are from individuals who profess to being mortal, eating (yes, garlic too), and only having a spoonful of blood occasionally because 'they need it'. When a letter like this comes from what sounds like a deeply disturbed teen then I wouldn't present it as "a letter from a possible vampire", but toss it in the recycle bin. When a person presents himself in one of those letters as being a vampire and in the next breath claim not to experience any harm from sunlight, and seeing his reflection in the mirror, and not needing blood to survive--you'd say Konstantinos would have had the common sense to not include a letter like that, but no.   So, those letters offer as far as I am concerned nothing that indicates that vampires actually exist, and everything that indicates that some people responded to Konstantinos's add, one that requested vampires to send letters to him and tell about themselves, in order to have some fun and see if they could fool Konstantinos. Maybe they fooled him, or maybe it was Konstantinos who fooled us, the readers. I am inclined to believe that the first is possible since his entire presentation has "immature" all over it. Then again, the possibility exists that he simply saw a way to make an easy buck. Regardless of whether or not Konstantinos was sincere in his attempt to proof that vampires exist, in my eyes he failed thoroughly and lost all credibility in the process. I'll make certain to stay away from his other books.  
 The canopy bar broke only two days after Christmas.   Now I have a sharp end on the bed frame.  Not good for little fingers.  For the price, I thought it would have been a lot more sturdy 
 I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this online, but how can you go wrong with a Disney product, right?!! I just assumed all CD's marketed as a Karaoke product included the lyrics as graphics on the screen.  I know that this was my mistake as a new karaoke machine owner. Live and learn, I guess. I purchased two other volumes at the same time, and, fortunately, realized my mistake before opening the other two.  Guess what?  They are being sent back! 
 I found this book to be extremely hard to follow as it was more of a fluffed up marshmellow than actually fact or theory based. What I found much easier to follow was one by M. R. Franks titled The Universe and Multiple Reality 
 Not much there,some good ideas but really only a few chapters worth of materia 
 Any resemblence between what is stated in this book and what's actually going on in the Middle East is purely coincidental.  What the reader gets instead is some amazing fascist propaganda that won't truly serve anyone.    Hirst writes for the Guardian, a rather famous British newspaper that took decades to establish a fine reputation for its journalism.  It is staggering to realize just how much damage the Guardian has done to this reputation in just a short while by permitting such nonsense to invade its pages.  And I think we need to ask ourselves how and why this has happened.  The staff of the Guardian has to be professional.  One would think that they would hesitate to destroy their paper in such a manner.  After all, it would cost the paper money.  It might ruin the paper entirely, and put them out of jobs.  One might suppose it unlikely that they would want to violate any semblence of good journalistic practice just to hurt a few Jews or Israelis.  However, the experience of reading this book and seeing some of the reviews has led me to a hypothesis of what has happened.  The destruction of the Guardian's reputation as a conduit of good journalism has not put it out of business at all.  Just as this book has brought money to its author, the ghastly articles in the Guardian bring money to the newspaper, if only by appearing sensational and controversial.    I think we readers have a duty to try to reverse this trend.  Just as dedicated people have made great progress in the campaign against cigarette smoking, the same can be done in the campaign against bad journalism.  We can warn our friends about books such as this one.  And we ought to do just that 
 Bobby Brown lost his flavor on this record.the songs Produced By New Jack Swing King Teddy Riley two can play that game,get away,till the end of time are tight as is the LA&Babyface cut good enough.but the problem is the  wack singing of Brown.he sounds flat.it wasn't as bad on this disc as it is  now.now he is a tone deaf.also while the album has highlights it has downs  as well.besides Bobby's bad singing some of the music make this album Don't  be cruel part 2.with the right voice this album would have been done  better 
 This book is terrible!  There are so many mistakes in this book, I don't even know where to start.  The family tree is so complex, that not even the author seems to have been able to keep it straight.  In addition the plot takes so many twists and turns and so many of them dead end that it is hard work keeping the story straight.  And the ending is predictable.  A character ("Ashely") identified as Odile's grandson on the family tree is called a great-grandson in the text.  The novel describes events that take place in 1999, yet Odile's birthdate is given as 1918, when the characters are supposed to be coming together to celebrate her eighteth birthday.  And when a character talks about an event in the 60's, she describes it as almost thirty years ago?  Last time I checked, that should be almost forty!!! In addition Henry's son is named Harry Jr.  Aren't Henry and Harry different names?  How did he (Harry) get to be a Jr. I couldn't put this book down - mainly because I wanted to see what would be wrong next. These errors bothered me so much, I got up to write a review at midnight - and I've never written a review before 
 I read the other reviews and I guess this book does give you a lot of information about a lot of baby products but I found the majority of the information so useless. It tells you things like if you are living in the city, and you are going to take the subway, you should look for a lightweight stroller. I knew that - I just wanted information on the best/safest/most durable lightweight strollers out there. That information is not in there. The most helpful section was maybe the cribs but the rest of the items' descriptions from baby bottles/nipples/breast feeding to strollers just told you what features to look out for... I was hoping more of a review of the actual specific products and which had certain features- this book did not do that. 
 Annie Proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media.  This fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot.  Unfortunately, imagery is about all there is to recommend Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2.  The narratives tend to drag in many of the stories, in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for.  All in all, for this reader at least, a major disappointment.  For readers who have enjoyed other works by Proulx, I wouldn't recommend reading this one 
 I was there and this book is not accurate and does not represent what was going on in English Football at the time.  For excellent alternatives try Steaming-In, Hoolifan, 'Armed For The Match' or 'Congratulations you just met the ICF'.  It's a well written book, but as is documented in other books on the subject, he never had any contact with any of the top faces on the scene (why not read a book by one of them that are available), nor was he ever involved in any major incidents.  In the book he talks about people as if he knew them, but is relaying stories he was told by wannabes.  Likewise he tells a story of a Millwall fan attacking a West Ham fan based on a newspaper account as if he was there (a very poor thing to do in a book like this).  However it is well writen, and an interesting account from an outsider - just beware of the taking contents as fact 
 Bought this from amazon.  Worked well for compact flash cards.  Always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card (from kodak camera).  so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera.  And all of a sudden, it died on me.  Had to throw it out 
 Magical Child does have its moments but these are few and far between.  One has to wade through overwrought hyperbole and constant repetition to get at the few insights Mr. Pearce does have.  His comments on childbirth  are poignant and do illustrate just how far we have allowed technology and  modern medical practice to distort what should be a joyous and natural  process.   This book is laced with annoying terminology and proffers claims  of clairvoyant capabilities that would shame a supermarket tabloid.  Had  the author concentrated more on child development and less on developing a  polemic, a more insightful and useful book would have been the resul 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 My first reaction to this album was "whoa, Sarah Brightman sounds AMAZING! I didn't know she could sing so great... in such lovely unaffected manner... she really toned it DOWN! how classy!" Unfortunately what would work for Brightman, does not work for Fleming, who is a real opera star and should know better. I think uptight opera snobs and people who can tell their Sills from their Sissel would agree that Fleming's tone here is just bizarre. What happened to her voice? There is annoying self-conscious smugness to it, her tone is so round, very "mushy", breathy. Maybe her label is trying to make her sound more like Sarah Brightman, certainly they share the repertoire already. What a tacky collection of the greatest crossover hits, not to mention, several choral numbers, like the Shepherd's Farewell from Berlioz's L'Enfance du Christ, that are reworked as solos, I don't know why and what for. Andreas Delfs' very reverential conducting reminds me of Mantovani, and the overall saccharine feel to every track is opressing. It's quite obvious that this record has nothing to do with God or anything sacred, rather it's an attempt to ride the bestseller lists. Of course, this album can work for some people, and there are many similar Andrew Lloyd Webber and Il Divo collections to enjoy. I am sure Renee will be back with Christmas album, and many more enchanting collections of soothing, lovely music. She still needs to cover Nella Fantasia. Actually, on this album she sings Faure's Pie Jesu, that's quite a blunder- the correct choice of funeral piece for your first crossover album is Webber's Pie Jesu, duh! Renee is new in this business, and she has lots to learn 
 Swartzwelder is the best writer on the Simpsons staff, bar none. But his prose style leaves so much to be desired. What works within the context of a voiced animated show falls flat on its face in print.  Swartzwelder revisits the character of Frank Burly, P.I., last seen in "The Time Machine Did It". That earlier novel worked, even though the joke got a litle long-in-the-tooth at the end. Here, the attempt to once again meld film-noirish black-and-white movie cliches with 50s-ish science fiction, this time an alien invasion that only Burly is too stupid to realize is happening, cannot even elicit a guffaw.  Some may feel Burly is simply Homer recast as Phillip Marlowe. But even Homer would remember to be, you know...funny. In this case, the formula very quickly becomes. Burly almost discovers invasion, incident causes Burly great pain, Burly forgets there is an invasion. It just does not hold up.  Maybe those who read this book without reading its predeccesor will enjoy it more as they will be unfamiliar with the formula. For those who are attracted purely by the "writer of the Simpsons" blurb, you're better off buying any of the DVDs and passing on this.  
 I seem to be in the minority, but I did not enjoy this book at all. The main character is, of course, the "only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf" but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness. I felt the plot got swallowed up by the author's need to self-insert and 'play' in her world, and the only reason I finished this book was that I was on a plane and had nothing else to do. The plot fishtails several times, and isn't all that interesting to start with. In short, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general, and will likely skip her books in the future 
 This book is so lame... I regret every minute I spent reading it.  
 I had high hopes when I bought this book. After all, I fly Southwest whenever possible, because it's the most efficient, well-run airline with top notch employees. Although this book covers that ground, it does so in a hype-filled, "Kellner is great, Kellner is good, let us thank Kellner for our flight, amen" style sure to turn intelligent readers off.  Nobody's perfect. What were the mistakes? What could Southwest have done differently? When the book is nothing but accolades, you begin to wonder if it's all true or not.  I still love the airline, but this book was a waste 
 The game footage here is very good, except it is constantly interrupted, and has no continuity. Some of the interviews seem genuine, while others are obviously staged. The students and players act as if they were given the green light by the director to be as gross and obnoxious as possible. In that, they succeeded.  Entries at the Sundance Film Festival must be awful indeed for this film to be a Grand Prize nominee. The coaches stand around in the locker room, while the players take turns giving each other the cursing of their lives. I was rooting for the opposing team to give Massillon a beating every game.    I can't recommend this film to anyone. It doesn't teach about football, the language is awful. I don't feel I know anything about Ohio football that I didn't know before I saw the film. I hope the Tigers are not a typical team in Ohio.   For a real football film, I recommend "The Last Game" 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Well, the so called "SEQUAL" to Flyy Girl was the worst book that I have ever read.  Flyy Girl wasn't that great of a book either, but I thought with "For the Love of Money" something good might come out of it. NO. This book is slow, boring, and just not interesting.  I have to say I kept on reading thinking something good would come out of it.  NOTHING.  I will never read an Omar Tyree novel again.  VERY DISAPOINTING 
 If you are a beginer in pond building and you need everything explained to details, do not buy this book. I bought it and it's just not good. You can read it under a hour and you'll see only pictures with nothing on them 
 Dr. Breggin's book casts a very illuminating light on the flaws of the drug approval process in America and the shortcomings of the antidepressant Prozac.  I am disappointed when reading others reviews though that most people are more intent on rating Prozac and not the book.  The book is extremely one-sided.  I was taught as far back as elementary school that essays should be constructed with Pro and Con arguments.  The author, while pointing out many cases of individuals unhappy with the drug, fails to discuss anyone who's life has been positively affected by Prozac.  As far as his citations go...they appear to be very selective...he backs up things here and there but if this were a scholarly work it would be rejected in the peer review process.  He also makes many ridiculous claims that made me laugh...e.g  "Although alcohol has been widely used throughout human society since before recorded history, only in the last decade have we begun to face the scope of its deadly impact on human behaviour and society" (Page 93 chapter 4, hardcover edition).  I am fairly certain that people have known about alcohol's destructive effects for as long as it has been used....maybe Dr. Breggin just figured it out.  The book started out well...but as I read more and more...the strength of his points began to be washed out by his fervor and he appeared to me to become more and more of a zealot than a person providing any sort of a fair, unbiased review of a drug...too bad...could have been a very good book 
 Ok this book is just another bla Photoshop book. Nothing great not nothing new that has not already been mentioned in other photoshop book 
 This book is a waste of time. It continually references Pollack and Kindlon, who have written much better books about boys. It did not contain any new insights. It is an academic study, more like a compilation of other peoples' work, and gives no advice or examples of how to actually improve communication with your boy. I am tired of these books that give us a bunch of handwringing about how bad things are for boys, and then don't tell us how, as individuals, to deal with it 
 I got this as a gift and if it wasn't alreay opened, I would have returned it. Theres nothing new or novel about the humor in the series. Its the same old tired race jokes throughout 
 I had trouble rinsing this stuff out; it weighed my hair down, and my hair is dry.  Also, my son came up to me and said, "Why does your hair smell so funny?".  I think it's too conditioning for my hair, and too smelly 
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 Now that Professor Chasteen's personal friends, ex-students, and professional connections have had their say, perhaps a dash of insight would be relevant. This is a lousy book, in part because the premise is ludicrous. There cannot be a concise history of Latin America for the same reason that there cannot be a concise rendering of Newton's Principia. Thus, what professor Chasteen has provided is a concise overview of his personal prejudices, the vast majority of which he directs against (and here's a surprise) the United States and Europe. That these prejudices are personal is evident from the dedication (in which he states that his Latin American children are improving the US simply by their presence) until the meandering, pointless fizzling out of his discussion 250 pages later. The history is mediocre, at best, and some of Chasteen's opinions are so ridiculous (anyone historian who singles out the Carter administration's foreign policies for admiration has been hitting the bong a little too hard) that you have to wonder why he continues to live in a country he so plainly abhors.  The writing is so saturated with neoliberal condescension that professor Chasteen's acknowledgement to the over 100 students who read the manuscript seems a wholly fitting exercise, given that they may well have written the dreadful thing 
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 I have long been a Dowd column reader, along with a half dozen other opinion page writers, and picked up this book at our local library.  There are many reasons why one writes a book, you have a story to tell, your editor / publisher gives you an idea, you want to keep your name before the public, you need the money, just to list a few.  I can't think that Dowd needs the money, unless she is being bribed because someone found out she is actually a conservative!  I also don't believe that she has the visceral need to keep her name before her public.  If she had a story to tell, one would think that it would be told in a more convincing, thoughtful manner.  Since I am male and a grandparent, I'm guessing that I am not the target audience for this book, and the positive reviews from several potential career women would seem to corraborate that they are the intended audience.  And herein lies one of my problems with Ms Dowd and this book.  It appears to have been written by a mid to late 30's woman surprised to find out that her options are running out, not by the 50 plus year old that she is!  Those of you with 50 year old mothers or aunts, I ask you, do they talk like this?  Is this the kind of advice you would expect from them?  Or has Ms Dowd, at least emotionally, stopped growing at about the same age as the ladies from 'Sex in the City'?  I expected a significantly more mature viewpoint from her.  I also quibble with several other points she attempts to make:  That Hillary killed feminism.  Well she didn't.  Feminism is alive and well, just ask my sisters, wife and daughter.  Some feminists lost their credibility attempting to defend Bubba's actions with Monica L (moral relativism), but what killed that part of feminism which was based on the supposed male belief that women were not their equals, was its internal inconsistencies---the same thing that doomed the USSR!  Please try to tell my wife that men are her equal when she had been leading her family--three brothers just like Ms Dowd--since she was 12!    Yes, drugs and plastic surgery are a problem--for folks with too much disposable income and too little to keep them out of trouble!  New York, LA and DC,while fine cities all, are not the entire US, and what passes for currently acceptable behavour, among the elite in those three cities, just isn't on the average person's radar.    As earlier reviewers have said, other writers have made the same arguments, much better, so I am left not having a reason why this book was written.  I am left with an hypothesis only, that Ms Dowd is questioning decisions she made over the last three decades, trade offs, questionable choices, etc. and is wrestling with those, not having yet come to a conclusion.  My data points are her lack of a response to Monica L; her acceptance of the job after her potential boss hits on her, giving a bye to Anita Hill for somewhat similar behavour, ditto Hillary.  I wonder what those nun she had in school would say?  As commented in the book vis a vis Elizabeth Vargas' removal from the Evening News, perhaps she doesn't have the 'gravitas' to write a book?  Or as Helen Gurley Brown said of Ms Dowd's initial effort for Cosmo 'pure pablum' 
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
 It's hard to figure out which review point to what...  Why doesn't Amazon.com simply leave reviews for this volume instead of linking to other books in the series.  It makes it confusing to figure out if this hardcover edition is worth buying over the paperbacks... 
 THE DVD HAS A VERY POOR RECORDING,YOU CAN'T HEAR THE AUDIO BECAUSE IT CONTINUE TO BREAK AND THE PICTURE FREEZES . I HAVE A RETURN TAG FOR THE FRIST ONE THAT WASN'T PLAYING .I JUST WANT TO NOTIFIED YOU THAT I AM GOING TO RETURN BOTH DVD. I WILL SUGGEST THAT NEXT ONE WILL BE TESTED AND MAKE SURE IS PLAYING VERY WELL IN VIDEO AND AUDIO.      THANK YOU. 
 Let me start by saying I love a good historical fiction book.  I picked up a copy of this one, after reading the reviews by others.  Obviously I don't have the same taste in books.  So not to knock anyone's thoughts of this book, but...Quite possibly this is one of the worst books in the already tastelessly saturated genre!  And I don't even pretend to have high standards!!!  Never have I seen a book so filled with cardboard characters (I won't even mention the awful stereotyping), completely predictable storyline, (which is one of the most preposterous I've ever read, by the way), and so overwrought with tacky metaphors.  I nearly died at the use of the supposed "local dialect".  I have never wanted to stop reading a book because it was so bad, but as they say, "never say never".  I read this to the end, just to see if it would get any better.  I thought it was turning a corner then wham!, the passage about the vegetables.  Why, oh why?!?  **To be perfectly honest, I was more curious to see whether this book could possibly get any WORSE, highly entertaining that it did!**  If you're not looking for a serious read, and would like a few juicy love scenes, then this book fits the bill.  (As I try to find a positive in everything).  Images of cheap dime store romance novels are forever emblazoned in my memory when I think of this book!  I find it impossible to take this book seriously.  I'd give it 0 stars, if possible.  My apologies to those who enjoyed this one!  If you want a sweet love story, set in a historical period, try Patience and Sarah by Isabel Miller.    
 After the wonderful Storming Heaven I was so excited to read this book, and then so disappointed.  The plot is melodramatic, the characterizations cardboard 
 Its filled with grammatical mistakes that translate into logical fallacies.  It is extremely long winded and repetitive.  The author goes no where with the material.  I recommmend stabbing your eyes out rather than reading it 
 As with Stick Figure, this book provides too many accounts of ways to fool parents, friends and doctors. While it is realistic, if you are not committed to recovery it can trigger ED thoughts and habits. When someone is in the depth of their ED, the horrible consequences of an ED explored in this book will be ignored while the message justifying an ED will be remembered and imitated. 
 Kiyosaki warns you stright away that this book will not suit 9/10 people.  Still I proceeded to read the book and found the information presented to lack substance and detail.  Some of the infromation contained in this book is indeed useful but it is very hard to asborb what is useful when the book has been written in a non consise and repetitive manner.  Kiyosaki mentions the stock market bear run of 00-03 and investors losing 7-9 trillion dollars in detail so many times that you begin to look for any other information this book has to offer.  No mention is given to the stock market rally after this time and the gains that followed.  For someone that does not seem to like the idea of mutual funds and the stock market in general, Kiyosaki loves to quote Buffet.  He seems to understand the market better then people such as Graham and Buffet in the way he can predict market cycles and is able to time his investments.  Based on Kioysaki's own statement, this book will not suit 9/10 investors 
 What more would you expect from a revisionist historian whose books read like novels, with no researches yet dressing up all half baked hypotheses as proven theses. Treat this book as some infantile rantings from an inadequate mind 
 One good song, of course "The sound of silence", and the studio version is far better than this one. I am not a fan of the genre as you might expect 
 Contrary to the previous review, I don't find Ms.Airey that proficient in Photoshop. Much of her artistic successes come from "Happy Surprises" in experimenting with various software and hardware. Which brings me to my next point. Be prepared to spend $1,000+ on such things as Nik Color Effects, AutoFX Photographic Edges, Wacom tablets and last but not least Studio Artist, which is only made for a Mac. So you'll need a Mac too if you want to try any of her "experiments". Nearly half the book is devoted to "Studio Artist" Inserts written by her compatriate artists use photoshop more than Ms. Airey. Some of her techniques are "way out there".  I may as well bought a book written by Rembrandt on "How to Paint Pictures 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 Pointless, pedantic power-point-speak, Bologna and Shaw offer a mindset that focuses on the dimwit scams that would leave a corporation pennywise and pound foolish.  The text reflects conventional wisdom of the 90s: beware counter-culture stapler thieves, but with enough accountants around you, all is well.  Such wisdom cost investors billions from dot-com bubbles and speculative scams.  Their reasoning fails on other grounds as well.  Bologna and Shaw discount the practice of law, rife with lawyers and politicians who "hairsplit" and texts, like the UCC, which they see as outdated.  Of course, their recitation of 1968 Black's Law definitions of crimes suggests that Bologna and Shaw are themselves somewhat out of date outside their field, and a bit dismissive to boot.  Which leads to their field: accounting.  The meat of the book reads like a series of 2-hour power point presentations: "Watch out for..." with a handful of notes and negligible application.  The point condenses thus: "To stop fraud, hire accountants."  To reach that point, one could sift through unhelpfully prejudicial generalizations like "Theft on the job is largely a counterculture phenomenon." Huh? So look for the long-haired employees when staplers go missing?  And in what sense was Enron culture "counter culture"?  Finally, the disingenuous flattery and cloying, typified by statements like "It is truly amazing how ingenious relatively uneducated on-the-job thieves are in circumventing control mechanisms designed by people of much higher intellect..."   Bologna and Shaw seek to flatter executives, possibly to advance their consulting prospects, rather than to provide useful advice.   Perhaps a corporate crime investigator is too dense to think through the obvious.    Dollars spent chasing dimes - the hallmark of lousy advice 
 The vastly overpraised Klosterman weighs in on various women friends and girlfriends while riffing on Led Zep, Sid Vicious, cocaine, and other hipster-oriented topics. As in his earlier books, he has a Camille Paglia-like tendency to make completely indefensible pat assertions. He's mildly amusing, sort of like Dave Barry with a post-baby-boomer's taste in music. And his capacity for self-absorption does make it easy to dismiss him as a male Elizabeth Wurtzel. This book should be bought used as cheaply as possible or borrowed from your local library. It's not worth the price of admission 
 This book was so badly written that I just couldn't help writing my first review on Amazon. I NEVER bothered writting reviews.  While I fully respect the authors' decision in providing the book online under the Creative Commons license, and while I do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions, the book is a total f*ck up. And f*ck up is an understatement.  The book: 1) Is unorganized :-  I felt I was being bombarded by information from all directions. One moment I was getting ready to test a simple "hello world" module, and the other I'm suddenly faced with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing "how function calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new functionality to a running kernel." with strange function names that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of the chapter. How the hell did I get here? It just pisses you off and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and frustrated.  2) Is upside-down:-  I read chapter 3 (Char drivers) and I compare it to real device drivers and some things just don't match. The book seems very theoretical because the "real" device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned at all. After digging in the kernel source files and googling the internet I realize that in the "real world" there is a whole driver-model and generic objects and what not. Reading the source code documentation and some online material I actually understand how the "real" drivers work. I still don't understand the stuff in the book. I start wondering whether there is any mention of the driver-model  and I find it in chapter 14 !!!!!!! The driver model seems, in my opinion, the first step to understanding how "real" drivers work and I find it after 14 chapters of utter nonsensce!! Not only that, the authors decide that "many driver authors can ignore the device model entirely" and "The complexity of the device model makes it hard to understand by starting with a high-level view"... surpisingly it was easier to understand from online sources and the source code documentation than trying to read chapter 2 in the book!  3) Is sadistic:-  One thing I really hated was the carrot-and-stick approach the authors chose. First they give you a small tiny taste of a topic   which finally seems relevant and just when you feel you're about to reach somewhere, they do a complete u-turn and throw all kinds of irrelevant off-the-topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so shamefull as to expect any better. You end up confused, annoyed, and duped. Like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the "hello world" module. OK fine. Seems easy enough. You naturally assume that this is an invitation to write the same code yourself. HAHA WROONG! The book suddenly does a "make hello.c" without showing you the content of the makefile. It leaves you out to dry with your uncompilable-"hello.c" and goes on describing IN DETAIL seemingly random stuff. You are left wondering whether the makefile must have been something too obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter "as-is". I chose the former. HAHAHA WROONG AGAAIIN! I ended up compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they decide to mention only 7 sections later.(At least they mentioned it?!)  In summary.. I'd suggest you buy the book.. and (as "./Documentation/ManagementStyle" for another book says): "NOT read it. Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture".  I don't think anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical book. If you come across any online material that "recommends" this book, *QUICKLY* discard that material too .. without thinking.  This is a -5 stars book. It has affected me personally 
 I picked up this volume because its title suggested that it would encourage hands-on science activities     that are essential to good teaching and effective learning. Unfortunately, I discovered on reading it that     the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific "establishment" with credulity for numerous     fringe ideas. The first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers     to tell when you'll be home for dinner! Sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as "evidence". The "do     it yourself" promise of the title is broken for the reader who doesn't intend to begin raising homing     pidgeons or doesn't happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants (such     as the speed of light) to nine significant figures. Far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic     research are given (in chapters about the feeling of being stared at, or "feeling" the touch of a severed     limb). Despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book, I liked a part of its message, that important science     can still be done by amateurs. That's about the only aspect of this book that is commendable 
 Extremely disappointed in this bag.  It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet.  On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home.  Also, the stitching is coming loose.  Also the strap is not leather.  A big waste of money. 
 This book should be entitled "The Obsessive-compulsive's Guide to Keeping House".  The lists of tasks to do daily, weekly and monthly were more than a little overwhelming. If you did all the things this book says you need to do to keep a clean, orderly home then you will have little time for anything else.  There are some good ideas in here, but they are overshadowed by the to-do checklists.  Also the pictures in this book are of rooms with a very sterile, minimalist look to them.  Boring.  The rooms are indeed clutter free and spotlessly clean, but lack character and warmth.  A little like living in a hospital. I was very disappointed with this book 
 Yup, definately the worst Halloween movie. Come on, Michael on a reality show? Ha! What the f**k does that have to do with the series? Not only that, but the plot is completely pointless, the acting sucks, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie! Not only that, but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary, and therefore comes off as pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE gore in movies, horror or not, but any knowledgable Halloween fan knows that the Halloween movies were always scary without the gore. Along with Halloween 3 (which actually had nothing to do with Michael), Halloween: Resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series. There are a many more problems with the movie than the ones I listed, but I'm tired of typing, so I'll let other reviewers explain why it's so bad. Bottom line, watch ANY Halloween movie other than this or Halloween 3 
 I had somewhat forgotten how Greg Bear wrote.  His descriptions of the  Jart are so obscure and long-winded, the reader may as well just turn the  page.  I found it annoying that Greg Bear attempted to invent even more  words in this book than Eon.  My largest complaint however resided in the  high number of typos, duplicated words, letters dropped etc that made the  reading even more disruptive.  It really looked like there had been global  replacements as the same errors were repeated.  While I'd admit that an  author is more concerned with flow, plot, and technical accuracy - the  editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals 
 This book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book (this has been noted by others) Anything of interest is said in the first chapter, followed by a lot of fluff - "sometimes the crowd is wise" "sometimes the crowd is not wise".  After the first chapter, I seriously couldn't read for more than 10 minutes without getting bored 
 With such an excellent story line, why was this viewer unable to connect with the characters and the events? I was a young man when the terror at Munich occurred - I remember with clarity and outrage. Yet, there is no real horror transmitted to the audience - only the constant confusion of watching a depressing and rambling film.   I guess the people of the world must hide under their blankets and hope nothing bad happens again. Why ever take action against those who want destroy the free world? Gosh, you could make a mistake!   In war, there is never a fair and balanced response - only more death and destruction. The hope is that you hurt the other side more than their capacity to hurt your side. Then, hopefully, they decide to stop and the world gets another brief respite until the next war.  Avoid this film. I wish I had not seen it 
 Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano, two stars are still generous. The book lacks coherency and is a mind-dulling read at best. Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust. It is hard to stay focused and interested in this book, no matter how ambitious the pianist. There are other great books out there that demonstrate the piano beautifully and that have a much stronger appeal. My recommendation is to keep looking and don't stop here. 
 I love drum and bass and I heard that dj rap was supposed to be one of the best... after the reviews I thought I'd give it a try. I was very disappointed...I wouldn't even classify her music as drum and bass. When I got it, the sticker said trip-hop pop (not d&b). I never write reviews, but this one was just so bad, I had too. 
 I was looking for a book to help with an upcoming trip to Glacier National Park area, but this one didn't fit the bill.  While I wanted suggestions for things to do, day trip recommendations, trail information, etc., this book is more like a "yellow pages" of Montana.  Want to know about motels?  It's here.  Want to plan activities?  Probably not the right book.  It's all black and white, very large (too large to pack), maps are scarce.  I'm going to look for a different option. 
 If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"  
 I'm a huge fan of the Ultimate lines of X-Men, Spiderman, Ultimate(Avengers), and of course the Fantastic Four.  For that reason, I am deeply upset with how UFF Vol. 4: Inhuman turned out.  First off, this cover is way too decieving.  Jae Lee, while an obviously talented artist, is definitely not the write person to be drawing for the Ultimate series.  It completely veered away from the amazing artwork done in the first 3 volumes, which is pretty much the uniform look for the entire Ultimate universe. The stories definitely could have been better written and needed to be spanned out more.  2 issues is definitely not enough to fully tell the story with the Thinker.  Then you have that UFF Annuals #1 which was even worse than the Thinker story.  TOO SHORT, plus the artwork was just wrong.  It was all a rare miss in the Ultimate line and having seen the upcoming Vol. 5: Crossover, it doesn't appear to be one that's going to be repeated 
 I personally don't like this book. I really couldn't get into it and found it nearly impossible to read for more than ten minutes. This book probably has all the correct techniques in it but I couldn't find the 
 I'm surprised that others have reviewed this movie with high rankings.  It's basically a mediocre movie, with not much of a story, nothing much that is enjoyable or uplifting, and some questionable content.  For most of the movie, Kevin Costner's character is chain-smoking cigarettes, cussing, and generally being a bad influence in front of the young boy he takes hostage, as they travel across Texas evading the law and breaking the law together.  There's nothing of value that comes out of this movie.  I'm glad I only paid a small amount to rent it, and not blow more money and time in the theatre. 
 Since you are inviting me to submit a review of the book that you have not yet shipped to me, I hope this note will help you to revise -- and improve -- your business procedures.  My rating, therefore, applies to the latter, not the book itself; I would've let the rating field empty had the system let me do so. Yours, BG 
 Taylor Dane has topped the US pop, dance and adult contemporary charts.   But the real test for blue-eyed soul is the US R&B chart. A single song that peaked at number 21?  She is just another blonde babe with a decent if indistinguishable voice (but she sure does look good in those videos, doesn't she?).  For the real goods, check out Lisa Stansfield or Teena Marie 
 Presence is a painful and shallow attempt at regurgitating Buddhist tenets wrapped in New Age emotionalism and claiming the creation of a new metaphysics for the Theory of U. The authors touch on a number of important principles, but added nothing to my understanding of them. Further, the book is peppered with veiled assumptions and unsupported assertions as the authors weave a world view of fragile connections between tear-jerking peak experiences, channeling for "the universe," and trying to get people inside an organization to talk to each other and their customers.  The authors are all highly-intelligent, highly-educated, and highly-regarded (that's why I bought the book) academics, but there is just nothing here. The authors' implication is that this is a book about healing the world, but other than some basic complex biological systems jargon it is not at all clear that they propose anything more than global meditation and a group hug. And despite the authors' fondness for oneness, correctedness, and nonattachment they had no qualms about nonattaching me from my oneness with $30 for this book, and they should. It's a disappointment and reads like a conversation between weepy teenagers or old women 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 It is unfortunate that they chose Solti's direction for the symphonic pieces in this soundtrack as he is simply one of the worst conductors for Beethoven.  His direction is so slow one would think he is leading a funeral procession instead of music inspired by the French Revolution.  Of all old school directors such as Karajan, Toscanini, etc., Solti's performances are simply morbidly slow to the point of killing the grieving attendants with boredom. The cacophony of the oversized orchestra doesn't help either. Solti's interpretations are even too slow for a requiem. You think a regular interpretation of the 7th's second movement is slow? Wait 'til you hear this one; you're going to need a massage you'll be so stiff. The 9th symphony march is supposed to be a brisk revolutionary march calling the citizens to arms and to join the militia marching through a town. With Solti you imagine only a funeral procession coming through the town. In the Fifth the whole orchestra is almost struggling to slow down to match the strings. Karajan's interpretations are not particularly fast either but at least he breathes some life into them and the orchestra. I personally like Toscanini in terms of the old 20th century symphonic conductors and Gardiner's traditional interpretations that are at least at a correct speed and give the listener the impression they are marching off as part of a revolutionary batallion to bring liberty to the oppressed instead of being rolled to the morgue. Beethoven was a revolutionary anti-monarchist and strongly supported the idea of political change.  Although Periah is a great pianist for Beethoven's concertos, there are simply better performances by him that fortunately aren't conducted by Solti such as on Sony with Bernard Haitink and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.  The same goes for the performances with Axe and Yo-Yo Ma.  Gidon Kramer's performance for the Violin Concerto in D is also mediocre at best: there are better violinists out there than Kremer for Beethoven.  This is just not the best CD to get quality performances of Beethoven's works.  Overall, Solti's interpretations are simply too sluggish and indecipherable to represent the ideals of Beethoven's music. Solti would definitely be my last choice for anything. You won't lose anything by not buying this soundtrack that's for sure: Solti's interpretations are so slow they will simply fossilize you. 
 Well, the title says it all.  Where was the editor on this?  The first rule of writing is always to keep your reader's interest.  I think major points of the book could be made less often to reduce repetitiveness.  And less written on points that are kind of obvious - like "Taxes impair wealth accumulation."  I tried reading just the summaries, but the book is more than just that.  I got it out of the library, but I ran out of renewals.  Even so, the ideas are VERY important to consider, so everyone should make an attempt at it 
 Yes i've just bought the videonow color fx and want more pvd's but they are kinda costly so i want to know is ther a need to buy this item?Can you burn regular dvd's to a pvd ?And is this going to be a wast of money?Is there any were to buy blank pvd' 
 i would have given this documentary 5 stars  except they showed the murder of a poor defenseless elephant. this was something ric burns could have left out, i found it somewhat disturbing. the people who ordered the murder and the one filming  should have been killed themselves. anyway the rest of the film is nothing less then an amazing documentary about coney island from the start to the run down coney island of today. 
 I purchased this item from Office depot. My item was defected piece which I returned. It cost me around 10$ on shipping (both ways) 
 I actually came on here to see if my son was the only one who burst into tears when the goldfish came on (he's 10 1/2 months)! He does startle easily though and perhaps that is what's going on. I had left the room for a second when it began and came running back when he started screaming. Daddy accidentally sent Baby Mozart back to Netflix (instead of his Star Trek DVD) so we were branching out into our Baby Einstein collection. I think we'll put this one away and try some of the others 
 You gotta love a political pundit like Joe Klein.  He didn't even have the decency to attach his name to his book.  Wow, that's courage.  That's a backbone.   Let's see, Klein goes around slamming the Clinton presidency, anonymously.  Thanks, Joe.  America needs more brave souls like you.  Go back to writing your drivel in Time Magazine.  Frankly I am surprised you have the courage to attach your name to your columns. 
 Bill does a good job here explaining the problems with the current morality of American's but other then that,   he sounds as if he is constantly trying to uphold his beliefs on us, continually bitching about people who do not choose to appear on the the o-reilly-factor, and downing everyone who has a bad word to say about him..   he claims he is not conservative, yet this book shows his support for almost every republican in power..  (who in there right MIND can say that george bush genuinely cares for our country?!) and defines himself to be 'with the working-class..'   POSER! 
 Looking back on this album, it really lacks any of the elements that make the "classics" by Billy Joel truly special.  Blow by blow: "That's Not Her Style" - fun rock song. That's all. "We Didn't...Fire" - Just listen to the music and ignore the words - this is just a terrible song. "Downeaster.." - okay song "... Extremes" - Pop/rock-ish; good piano solo. "Shameless" - he should be for writing this one. "Storm Front" - decent, but feels like he's forcing it. "Leningrad" - interesting lyrics "State of Grace" - nothing special "When in Rome" - forgettable "And So It Goes" - now this is a special song. If you really like the B. Joel songs that dig deep and you feel every note and lyric, this is the one. You're better off downloading this one song than buying the whole album.  Get yourself the "Songs in the Attic"  album and call it a day.    
 I wish I had read the reviews before paying for this. The key word for this edition is ABRIDGED. According to the editor Philip Edward's introduction, only about a third of Cook's/Beaglehole's text is included.  
 I just finished reading "Black's Law Dictionary," and I must say I disagree with many of the reviews on this board. I thought the story was fairly uninteresting and the characters one-dimensional. It started strong (the "animus capiendi" scene comes to mind) but it dragged in the middle and ended flat (too much time spent on the "year-and-a-day rule"). I will admit I thoroughly enjoyed the list of British Regnal Years in Appendix G. Good effort by the author, the up-and-coming Black, but just two stars from this reviewer. 
 As a professional/advocate in the field of autism treatment, I am continually disheartened by the large number of false claims made about the causes/treatments of this disorder. This book only adds to that trend.  As of the writing of this review, there are still no definitive data to suggest that autism is caused by environmental toxins or vaccinations (although the author suggests otherwise). While the effects of environmental influences continue to be investigated by competent researchers, it is irresponsible to suggest to parents of children with autism that we already know the cause of this neurological disorder. The only influence/potential cause of autism that has strong evidence to this point is a genetic influence.  Homeopathic treatment of autism? How can the author seriously suggest that such a treatment is advisable? Homeopathic compounds have NEVER been shown to be effective for ANY disorder (autism or otherwise) under controlled conditions (and by that I mean double-blind placebo-controlled studies). Although many persons have reported a benefit of homeopathic rememdies in their own lives, just as many people have reported the same effect when given a placebo. This suggests that homeopathy rests on people's beliefs for its perceived effectiveness.  I typically suggest that people search the "Association for Science in Autism Treatment" on the internet to get a handle on what professionals really know about the causes and effective treatments for autism. 
 This book has been the most difficult book I have every used.  I have found more useful information from atlas.asp.net then in this book.  Almost every example that I used has had either old syntax errors or just plain syntax errors.  In spending so much time finding the errors, I feel the book should be called "Where's Atlas" 
 Way too blah...don't bother - better tater books out there 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 I, too, wish I had read the reviews before buying this useless book.  I purchased it thinking it was a different book, an excellent one I recall from the 1980s, that actually had useful lists.  In addition to the problems mentioned by other reviewers, I warn that the print in this book is very tiny, jammed together, and somewhat blurred 
 I found it hard to enjoy - I miss melody and don't care for strange arrangements and jazz motifs 
 ...this is nothing like the Spirograph I grew up playing with.  As everyone else mentioned, the gears are much too thin and slip constantly.  My 6 year old son was completely frustrated after wrestling with the design flaws.  Don't waste your money! 
  I gave this book 2 stars because the first 2 fifths of it were good.The rest stunk.  As more eloquent reviewers have mentioned Galbraith refers to himself and his accomplishments almost as much as he takes cheap shots at Republican administrations. Innuendo, nitpicking minutiae drip from the pages - his rant about the inappropriateness of some administration speech writer (without input from the State Department - oh no!) referring to an "axis of evil" incorrectly because an axis must be a straight line is one example. The pages ooze with Galbraith's liberalism and elitist arrogance as he hypocritically spotlights the arrogance of others.  He writes continuously about himself. He acknowledges he feels the overthrow of Saddam is justified and then complains about the way it was done. All the while acknowledging most people are better off in Iraq today.   He actually has the balls to say that the nuclear developments in N. Korea and Iran are somehow the fault of the invasion of Iraq.   In the acknowledgements it becomes clear that Galbraith is writing homage to his dad who wrote a "little book" called "How to Get Out of Vietnam." He even admits his lecture series was called "How to get out of Iraq."   Armchair Generals and Presidents abound in the printed page. Unless you are looking to reconfirm your own administration-bashing prejudices, I recommend you save your money and check it out of the library; it will ease the pain of your wasted time. 
 This book is terrible. It is hard to follow and the sequence is illogical. There is no section that simply lists names and meanings...everything is chopped up into silly little chapters. All in all, this book offers little new information. I got a better list of Irish names from a regular baby name book 
 Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot.  Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series.  As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.  It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all.  I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.  There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.  I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one 
 This book is more for conspiracy theorists than for people learning Remote Viewing. The book does include some Remote Viewing techniques which have derived from other techniques with the author's pseudo-science explanation of why it is suppose to be better than other techniques, which I disagree with. The author spends a great amount of detail with this pseudo-science, which is a detriment to him. Clearly the author has no scientific background whatsoever. In Chapter 3 of this book, the author attributes psi-ability to what he calls psi-genes. He states that "the widespread burning and persecution of witches in medieval Europe would have deselected psi-genes in Western women, making them much rarer" and that "European men score significantly better at remote viewing than women." This demonstrates he doesn't have a good understanding of natural and/or artifical selection and how genes are transfered in offspring. There are no genes that are only passed from women to women. It's true that mitochondrial DNA is only passed from women to offspring, but that would not deselect psi-genes in Western women since both male and female children would still recieve the mitochondrial DNA and the affect of deselecting would affect both sexes and not one. If we are going with genes that are just passed down from males to males, then we would be looking at the Y-chromosome. Since women never recieve the Y-chromosome, then they wouldn't be able to have a psi-gene if it was related to the Y-chromosome.   If you want to learn techniques for Remote Viewing, there are better books out there. If you want to learn the science behind Remote Viewing, please stay away from this book because the author doesn't have a clue about science and is speculating from other material he has read and didn't understand. If you like conspiracy theories and are getting tired of reading about JFK and Area 51, go ahead and pick up this book. It may entertain you 
 Cheap and definitely nasty - they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear-cups, but after a few months light use, I lost sound through one cup then the other. In general - when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on. The batteries seemed to last pretty long though - actually the battery I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself. Very disappointing, but for the price, this is hardly unexpected 
 I taught this class with this book several times, and it makes the material more difficult for students. It is one of the worst textbooks available for Calculus. 
 I bought this camera and it took great pictures above water, but none of the pictures I took underwater turned out. I looked at the negatives and it was like I never even clicked the shutter. The negatives were blank where I took the underwater pictures 
 As an experienced programmer, I wanted a book that wouldn't waste my time teaching me C/C++ or explaining event loops in lots of detail. I also wanted comparison between Garnet and Cobalt versions of the Palm OS.  This book does provide some of that information.  It does not provide valid examples. The first code examples are in chapter 3. They claim to build on the Draw application from chapter 2, and assume the reader has details about the event loop from chapter 2. Chapter 2, however, contains neither code nor a description of the event loop used in Palm software. There is no reference to the Draw application in the index, either.  After studying sample code from Palm's web site and trying lots of things in the development environment, I was able to get something that worked.  Other examples mix Garnet and Cobalt veriable types so they wouldn't compile on either system or contain other errors that prevent them from compiling.  A less-experienced programmer would probably give up on page 25 where the text tells the reader to modify a resource file that does not exist. Such a programmer would probably rate the book with one star.  I have not completed the book yet although I intend to do so. I felt compelled to warn other readers about its inaccuracies.  A CD or web site (with working examples!) would be useful to copy and paste tutorial information instead of requiring lots of typing 
 Osborne and Gaebler's ideas have been around a long time; don't be misled into thinking this is something new.  Particularly objectionable is their use of phrases such as "sluggish pace of bureaucracy" which is  designed to feed into the reader's own stereotype.  The book feeds upon the  fear of the reader, and therefore does not offer much in the way of  scholarly reading.  One would do better to read some Herbert Simon or  Charles Goodsell before embarking on this journey 
 When I watched this stinker, I felt like sniffing it and covering it up. This is just another attempt to cash in on nostalgia.  Obviously the producers of the film were aiming at parents fond memories of the Dr. Seuss classic childrens book and tried to exploit it into an updated version. It fails miserably. It is another example of Hollywood dumping tons of money on the look of a movie instead of the script. Dont get me wrong, this movie looks great. It has awesome costumes and set design but the problem is, it seems like they whipped the screenplay out in 20 minutes. Even the kids think this movie stinks. Do your child a favor, avoid this film and instead sit down and read your child the original book. They will appreciate it way more.   
 Bridge, an album that plays absolutely no testament to a band whose ability far superceedes this pile of [garbage].  I have been listening to BT for about 15 years now, seeing them doing live shows in the Jersey area in the late 80's.  If you want a great album, buy "Save His Soul," dont waste your time with this garbage.  Im sorry Bobby S. is dead, he truly was a backbone for this band, listen to any early stuff and his bass is clearly prominent.  Its a shame 
 I hate to be mean, but this book was a snore! Page by page went by with nothing exciting or that you couldn't have thought of yourself! Very boring book! Not worth the shipping even! Please, spare me the thought of YOU reading it.. 
 I bought the audio book and I didn't like the way the woman read the material.  Her voice was sappy and affected which was a real turn off for me.  I felt the examples used in the book didn't quite capture a wide enough variety of woman.  I actually came away feeling worse about "midlife crisis" which was not my purpose in purchasing the book. It was typical of the material out there already.  Nothing fresh or new.  For example, "the gardener" was one of the categories of women in mid-life crisis. Cut me a break!  That is the old stereotype of a middle aged woman.  There weren't enough modern references 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 The title and what seemed to be overwhelming praise captured my attention.  When the book arrived I was eager to read it.  I cracked the pages and my jaw dropped, not in a good way.  This book is so poorly written I am baffled  at how it ever got published in the first place.  I read as much as I could but the poor use of language and annoying blocks of italicized text made it impossible.  I returned to Amazon to look at the reviews, again.  This time, rather than just taking the star rating and "featured reviews" at face value, I really went through page by page and evaluated the reviews.  It appears that many, many kids have been assigned to write a review here at Amazon as part of a class project.    If you read through all of the reviews on this site you will see that most of them are written by children.  95% of the kids reviews have given the book a 5 star rating which has thrown off the rating.  If you pay attention to the reviews not written by children you will see that the majority of adults do not enjoy this book.  If you're between the ages of 11 and 13 you, apparently, will love this book.  If you are an adult, who knows better, don't expect much from it.  In my opinion, it is a waste of paper.  (On a side note:  A little time investigating the author brings into speculation the veracity of his story. 
 To quote from an extensive review in the Denver Jounal:  "This book must be used with caution because it pretends to describe what we now really know about archaeology and how it contradicts various biblical claims; however, it does so in a biased and non-objective manner. Contrary opinions in interpreting the new evidence are not discussed, much less given a fair hearing. The book is ideologically driven and should be treated that way by any one who reads it."  
 During a time when I was interested in Athurian literature, I picked this book up from the local used bookstore.  The owner told me it was supposed to be a good series.  I had pretty high hopes.   When I started reading it, I was disappointed at first, to discover that there was to be no magic but I decided to keep going.  After all, magic isn't everything.   The writing is good, I suppose, but it just didn't hold my interest.  It could also use better editing.  I remember a part where Uther is is thinking or talking about his dead mother, when his mother was actually still alive.   The part that made me stop reading was after Uther rescues a woman from brigands who had just repeatedly beat and raped her.  On their journey home, they stop to rest and clean up.  When the woman's nakedness is exposed, Uther gets turned on and they eventually have sex...What woman, no matter how strong willed, is going to want or feel like having sex just hours after being raped and beaten?  Ridiculous 
 Who wouldnt want a better profile?  I was very excited with my purchase, however I was quickly disapointed.  The sling hurt and didnt fit my private area comfortably.  After one wash, the underwear shrunk.  Love low rise, but these pair were too low.  My crack was showing!!!!!  
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I never received the book!!! I am still trying to figure out who it was delivered to. Tracking info said it was delivered to my address over a month ago but I have not seen it and no one seems to know where exactly it is.  Wanted to read it over christmas break but already back in school guess it will have to wait until summer now...maybe it will be here by then. Next time I will just go to the local book store and save myself the hassel.  
 I hope the writing sytle of Dr. Dement's journal articles and public relations peices are different then the one he used in this book.  If they are the same, it would explain a lot about why there isn't as much public recognition of sleep problems...  That said, I wanted to like this book.  I tried.  Really.  But I couldn't make it 1/4 of the way through.  The content of this book is very interesting and important, or at least it should be.  For example, the notion of sleep debt is a very important one and should become part of our everyday lives.  However, the style of this book is thick and meandering, making it hard to skim or digest any key points.  If you ask any technical writer what the worst thing you could possible say about a peice of writing, they'd tell you "so what?"; which basically means an author failed to do their primary function: successfully communicate.  Many, many times I was asking myself "so what?  whats your point??"  For example there was a page long digression about a conference where there was a naked dancer (I think that is what it was talking about anyway).  Is this book about sleep, or about Dr. Dement's conference trips?  Who knows...  Clocking in at around 450 pages, this book is far, far to long.  With some basic editing, the book could easily be distilled to about 1/2 it size and not loose any of its message.  I really wish somebody would do it too, then maybe I could finish reading all this man knows about sleep...  But at this length and with this writing style, I just can't bare it 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 Book of semi-historical signifance. Normal everyday reader will find book boring and "long" winded.  Good primary sources but not a book with a "bite."  No new information given to change this person's mind about the Victorian Era in England.  Bailey's thesis is lost in the mire of words 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
  Ill sum it up quick, the more you talk about panic /anxiety disorder, the more you join support groups and talk about it constantly , the more you make it a part of your life , the longer it will stay and the deeper it will get into your subconscious, which will make it harder to overcome, but overcome and be completely cured you can be and its very easy ,as much hate from other suffer's ill probably insight by saying that, the problem is that these type of books are the last thing you need. search the net for a guy named Charles Linden, the get back to livin 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 This is a terrible book.  The translation juxtaposes English words that are presumably equivalents of the original Chinese ideograms.  The result is incomprehensible.  The English words appear to flow in gramatically  correct sentences but they make no sense.  The translator appears to have  no idea of what the I Ching is about or how it was used in Chinese culture.  Unfortunately, I bought this book and wasted my money 
 Don't take the star rating wrong - this is as good as any of the other books in this series, but this edition (Quiet Vision Publishing - paperback, printed in 2000) is the cheapest printing of a book I've ever seen. Only about 20 pages into it, pages started falling out of the back. The type is huge and goes all the way to the edge of the page so your thumbs are constantly in the way while you're trying to read, and there are typographical errors like using two hyphens instead of em dashes. I know they make an electronic version of this book. As part of my job I convert a lot of print-intended content to digital publishing formats, and that's what usually happens to em dashes during that process, so I almost wonder if they just printed out their digital version and bound it. It looks like it was printed on a laser printer (especially the terrible cover illustration which looks like it was drawn by a 12-year old), and the fonts look like they're just PC-standard 'Times'. There are also several footnotes, which in the original edition that I read years ago were placed at the bottom of the page they were referenced from. In this edition they're in the back of the book 
 I never really saw what was so great about Iggy Pop.  He was hyper and screamed.  so what?  So does my two year old son 
 A poor, incomplete and unwieldy reference.  "Modern American Usage" fails to deal with many of the everyday issues people struggle with in their writing -- the list of omissions is long and varied -- and those that are included are sometimes addressed with a lack of thoroughness or clarity. Too often, and too irritatingly, entries merely redirect users to other headings, when the issue could easily have been resolved under the original entry-heading. Those involved in creating this edition seem not to appreciate that a little duplication goes a long way in making what is, first and foremost, a craftsperson's tool user-friendly.            
 While the memory foam in this pillow is of good quality and the craftsmanship seems equally good, this pillow is too small to do an adult much good.  It is much smaller than you might think and will not serve its intended purpose.  It could be perfect perhaps for a child 
 Unfortunately, this book doesn't make it any easier to understand various critial theories.  It skims over them in a way that requires the reader to already have a basic understanding of the theories, and it often explains the theories in the jargon of the theorists.  In other words, it isn't very helpful for those trying to get a handle on unwieldy theories.  It isn't a basic introduction, nor is it for "dummies."  
 Just when you thought every rediculous theory had been put into print, here comes Sally McFague and her organic model of political correctness.  Can we please have more new definitions for everyday reality?  Before I  read this book, I had no idea that I was a morphic descendent of the  protozoan patrea conspiracy.  If you don't already hate old white men in  America, and you're looking for a reason to, buy this book, and get your  carpet cleaned by Sally McFague 
 As a screenprinting teacher, I am always on the lookout for good screenprinting manuals to recommend to my students. Unfortunately, this is not one. It is an OK book if you know NOTHING about screenprinting and want to do it for a hobby to make some cards or do projects with your kids, but I do not recommend it for someone who is looking to get into screenprinting more seriously 
 Chomsky's pseudo-dissidence is revealed by, among many other lies found throughout his oeuvre, his repeated insistence upon the CIA's unwavering fidelity to successive Presidents. Where the evidence is contrary, he ignores it. Nowhere is the suppression more systematic than in Rethinking Camelot: JFK, the Vietnam War, and US Political Culture. Consider, in particular, his Stalinoid survey of the Vietnam coverage of the New York Times from October 3 to December 4, 1963 (in this paperback edition, pp.82-83). One omission, among many, will suffice.  On October 3, 1963, the NYT carried a column entitled "The Intra-Administration War In Vietnam." It opened: "The Central Intelligence Agency is getting a very bad press in despatches from Vietnam..."  Its author, Arthur Krock, proceeded to quote extensively from one such despatch, "Arrogant CIA Disobeys Orders in Vietnam", by Richard Starnes of the Scripps-Howard group. The quotes below are from Starnes's courageous and hauntingly prophetic original.  According to Starnes's source, "Twice the CIA flatly refused to carry out instructions from Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge", even though one set had been brought direct from Washington. Likening the CIA's growth to a "malignancy", which he was "not sure event the White House could control any longer", the source predicted: "If the United States ever experiences a Seven Days in May it will come from the CIA" (Washington Daily News, October 2).   Chomsky was, and remains, the creation and creature of the Central Intelligence Agency. Rethinking Camelot represented the cashing of the CIA's most important dissident chip in its unending war against both genuine dissent, and JFK's memory. It is a measure of the fear, corruption and cowardice prevalent in mainstream Anglo-American academia and media that Chomsky's imposture has gone unchallenged for so long. 
 They totally misrepresent this product. It does not work with Macs. I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex, shame on you 
 This is not the best work from this author. It would be of no use to the beginner or the experianced. I would not reccomend this book 
 The first book in the series, City of Ember, is brilliant.  The second book, People of Sparks, is still interesting, although it does not live up to its full potential.  The Prophet of Yonwood, a prequel to City of Ember, is completely dull.  It takes so long to get to the point (the point being how Ember becomes Ember and exactly what has happened, etc.) that I rushed through all the pages to find that there are only 2 pages at the very end to connect the plot in Yonwood to Ember.  It's so disappointing because I was earnestly hoping that all the details and mysteries that are just hinted in the City of Ember would be unraveled in Yonwood 
 This book is not worth the time or effort to read it.  And I do mean effort.  Marvel decided to be cheapskates this time out and had the binding glued.  Which means you have to pry it open and hold it with both hands to see all the art and/or Wordballons when you start getting to the middle of this book.  So I say, save your money.  Pass this one by and show Marvel that you expect better for 75 bucks then this 
 I bought this thinking "Failures due to normal wear and tear", which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page, would include accidental damage such as dropping.  However the pdf indicates that (3) DAMAGE FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE, MISUSE, INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN OBJECTS INTO THE PRODUCT," is not covered.  This is just an extended manufacturer's warranty.  A call to customer service confirms this - damage due to accidents are not covered.  Save your money 
 This piece of filth was written by a self-loathing male and is bought by misandric, self-centered imbeciles. It's nothing but a grocery list of men's faults and an insinuation that women, in contrast, are perfect. Even violence against men is joked about: suggestions of women shooting men and even severing their private parts.  If there were a similar book about WOMEN being awful, NOW would have sent death threats to the publishing house. Ridiculing men for about a hundred pages is no different.  This piece of sexist garbage is for the woman who says how much she hates men -- and then wonders aloud why no one will go out with her. Who in his right mind would 
 I was looking at purchasing this book, but based on the sarcastic  comments the author left for another reviewer (Cosmo, who was in no way inappropriate) I changed my mind and did not purchase it. 
 I have read Ralph Kimball's Tool Kit as well as Nicholas Galemmo's Mastering Data Warehouse Design books recently - both are excellent for techno-functional professionals. This book reminds me of a textbook they made you read to have an overview of EDP about 30 years ago.. 
 The second that you hear someone denounce someone else's politics or beliefs as "an illness", you can be sure you're in the presence of a totalitarian thinker. Michael Weiner's (nee Savage), diagnosis of liberal politics (read: Democrats) as "an illness" summons up previous political movements that traded in such diagnoses and those movements' "cures" for their sick countrymen: Nazi concentration camps, Soviet psychiatric prisons, and Maoist re-education camps, where millions of decent citizens were treated for their political illnesses, with most patients never to be seen again. Like his Nazi, Soviet and Chinese mentors, Weiner is a provincial and intolerant political reductionist, xenophopic and fearful of change, yearning for a return to a mythical "better time," and relying on the rhetoric of stultifying simplicity: Those who agree with him are well, all others are sick.   Hell hath no fury like a goosestepping Jew. God help us if some crafty politician ever rises to the presidency by standing on a stack of books such as this.  
 Unfortunately this book is all politics.  Using cherry picked info to back her views, Ms. Hendershott spins just as well as any Fox News pundit.  Sure, any person with common sense understands that pedophilia is dead wrong, but it doesn't automatically follow that all of the assertions in her book are then true. She rails against Clinton's sexual indiscretion while extolling Bush's virtue, while he lied to us to get us into a war, has approved of torture, works steadily to dismantle all environmental protections and has been at the head of the most corrupt administration in our nation's history.  Hypocricy is also a form of deviance if one believes the truth to be a norm 
 I did find the book helpful for some types of wood, however, I also found that some of the discriptions were verbatum to another book that I had.  I am not sure who copied who.  This book did not list all the common names of some of the more available species where it went overboard on some very obscure species.  I also found it lacking in the number of species that it covered.  I have many species in my shop that are not mentioned anywhere and they are readily available commecialy 
 I was enjoying this book for the first sixty-seventy pages until I read Mr. Lengel's description of Ft. Ticonderoga. He places the Fort on the Hudson River. (????) Ft. Ticonderoga, so important a location in the French/Indian and Revolutionary wars is, in fact, on Lake Champlain. Mr. Lengel also incorrectly writes that Henry Knox, after retrieving the cannons from Ft. Ticonderoga takes them down the Hudson. This too is incorrect. Knox and his men took the cannons across land to Lake George (which was frozen in winter), down to Lake George village and south to Albany before turning east to Boston. I'm totally shocked that no review of this book mentions these inaccurate statements. Anyway, after about 100 pages I took the book back to the library. I couldn't depend on the rest of his facts-so what's the point of reading it? 
 Every thing works well enough with the exception of the HDMI terminals that were not functional correctely as I recieved the Sharp Aquos LC32D42U LCD HDTV.  The picture blinks on and off when I used either of the two HDMI terminals for input from my Direct TV HD receiver.  Toke some effort to get Sharp arrange warrenty repair.  It is still in the shorp.  Hopefully it will get fixed soon.  Aother feature that is missing from this TV is the option of elimating weak stations ater auto tune 
 During fourth of july vacation, I had a chsance to see an old college friend, who is a vice president for a large computer hard drive firm... he was showing offf his new Toyota hybrid when we began talking about the market forces, which interfered with large companies responding to the emerging needs and changes in the marketplace.  I was fascinated as he explained to me the difficulty of an older company attempting to incorporate new technologies, while maintaining a profit margin necessary to please investors.  It was during this explanation, He recommended "The Inovator's Dilemma".  All I can say is that his verbal synopsis was far m ore interesting than this dry two-hour lecture on CD. I can only surmize that there must be another book by the same name 
 The worst book ever written about the Middle East is probably Joan Peters' From Time Immemorial; in this book Alan Dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from Peters, he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so.  The man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community's leading delinquents and most prolific violators of International Human Rights Law, International Humanitarian Law and UN Resolutions.  His defending of nation states, however, is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable.  Joan Peters' book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by Norman Finkelstein, and even the most ardent of Zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless.  20 years after that book faded into oblivion, Alan Dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own.  For a full documentation of this plagiarism, see Norman Finkelstein's personal website.  By writing this book, Dershowitz has inflicted more damage on Israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could.  Any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy The Case for Israel really is; both the book and the `case' that Dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies, bigoted arguments, idiocies, misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams. 
 I was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it 
 Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't "light reading" or entertaining at all. Be warne 
 I took this guide to Oaxaca to carry in the field, as the Howell guide is so heavy.  I almost threw it over the cliff at Monte Alban.  It will help you remember which euphonia is which, but for anything more subtly marked it is almost no help at all.  Furthermore, there are no range maps, no details on alternate plumages, little to no information on vocalizations.  I would have done better to bring the old Peterson guide, even though it is out of date 
 I ordered this and figured for $14 it would be a good deal (as you would normally get on amazon). Well there are only 2 songs! It is basically a cd single with a flip side for $14! don't get it! go to best buy for the whole cd for maybe $18. This is not worth it. But with the free shipping I had, if I send it back, I pay for shipping. they basically have you there. highly recommend you get something else 
 I should have read the reviews.  I purchased this item, and it quit working after a week of normal use 
 Today, it came out that Felt was Deep Throat.  Seems this guy's sleuthing ability isn't that good... 
 If you have even spent a little time in your life reading newspapers, magazines, the net, etc you will have seen 99% of these trivia lists and items.  Save your money so you can buy a better quality toilet paper 
 I've bought dozens of books over the years for all Macromedia and Adobe products and this one is probably the worst. It's like a dictionary that doesn't have the word you're looking up but - sure enough - the word "chair" is in there.   I have yet to find anything I need in this waste of shelf space. It does, however, tell you that File > New creates a new document 
 In my opinion this was not a good book. If it hadn't been such a short read I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it. Maybe the movie is better

 We would like to send this item back.  The construction was flimsy, and the assembly is very cumbersome.  One of the pieces broke when it was being assembled.  The item was inexpensive, but not worth the trouble to assemble 
 While there are some flashes of brilliance in this album, it is compromised by a lack of direction. The 'Tastes so Sweet' mix of Rapture is beautiful, although cut far too short. Faithless, Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic, and Crystal Method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album. The high point, without contest, is Darude's ripping mix of Rising Star's 'Touch Me'. This is a cut to throw on for the peak... when you find the party is just outside of Barstow with Hunter. That said, then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album. These are more appropriate in an adolescent Brit girl's drawer next to the Spice Girls. For some labels, this would be normal, for Ministry however, it is a dissapointment 
 How disappointed I was in purchasing this book, especially considering how much I've read about the author.  The writing is marginal, relying more on recipes from the tea rooms.  The photographs are low quality, and do not typically depict the tea atmosphere as normally presented by the tea rooms.  I was expecting "CLASSY" and got "TACKY".  I think the author, Bruce Richardson, uses this book and his other to officiate his own tea room 
 The other volumes in this series have all been excellent, but careless editing and some wooden writing weaken this book's advice.  Spelling errors (Wurthering Heights, racquet for racket) and weak prose (Rozelle likes to split infinitives with adverbs) weaken credibility, and some of the advice is questionable.  Rozelle favors using adverbs to clarify prose instead of finding strong verbs and specific nouns.  He also tends to use older books for examples, many at least 15-20 years old.  This is especially true when he discusses genre fiction in superficial terms.  Some of the book is irrelevant, too, discussing characterization without relating it to setting or description.  I'd suggest Monica Wood's book on Description instead of this one 
 Although a cd teaching Catalan is great, it really needs to have the guide in order to use it properly. This is not clear in the description 
 I am a fan of WWII movies. I was looking forward to the arrival of this two disk set. The Film is of course magnificent. I was looking forware to the addition stuff that now comes with DVDs, commentary, interviews, making of films, featurettes, etc. Afterall, there are lots of historians and others who will add to the filmit self. I was wrong. the commentaries are so bad I could hardly make myself finish them. Neither commentaters was prepared. The other matterial was also very poorly done as commpared to what is available on the History Chan and other sources. 
 I found the book worth not just borrowing, but actually buying, partly because there just isn't much out there in the way of "so, now you know you're a vampire, where do you go from here?" material on the market. Real vampires face a dearth of written information. I have to give Belanger credit for trying to solve the problem.  On the other hand, it's good that her introduction advises the reader to "find your own truth," because you won't find much truth between the covers of her book. Most of it is written for Kheprians, and if you don't see yourself as a Kheprian (or believe that a Kheprian temple exer existed in prehistoric Egypt, or see a proto-Egyptian group of occult workers who severed themselves from the forces of life as the origin of true psychic vampirism) then applying the advice in the book requires a bit of mental gymnastics.   Furthermore, for the general reader, the information on basic psychic technique is available in any other new age or pagan text, many of which are listed in the extensive bibliography that somehow never actually gets used in the Codex for real honest-to-George-Burns quotes. For the advanced reader, there are some interesting passages on feng shui (read advanced stuff, that), psychic surgery, exorcism, and the undesirableness of astral fleas.  All this makes for entertaining reading, but as with Aleister Crowley's _Book of the Law_, keep your BS detector turned on and beeping 
 I read alot and I've never seen so many commas in a book in all my life! I keep having to go back to re-read a sentence to see if a missed the period somewhere. I've, gotten, about, half, way, through, the, book, and, don't, think, I, can, finish, it!! AHHH 
 This book is, in large part, a result of the author's dissertation.  In an attempt to try to get something published and/or tenure, she compiled descriptive information about gangs in St. Louis and Columbus.  While it may be interesting to a few in academia, this book offers no practical value to the gang problems we face everyday.  Nor can it be applied to prevention/intervention programs in other locales 
 At the outset it worked very well. To the few months the pencil failure. Now single use mouse. But sometimes it works very badly. He is very annoying. I do not recommend to acquire this product. Cheap it leaves expensive. He is better to pay a little but to obtain a good article more 
 I cannot understand why this book got so many good reviews. I'm not saying that if I didn't like it, no one can or should, but I really don't understand. It's so tedious. Every little thing in these unbelievable characters' lives is described to such great length. Unnecessarily so. Why do we need to know all the details about every piece of art work this guy made? A summary would do. And to take soooooo long before getting to the point. It's like half the book was merely background to the reall thing, but why so long?! And the characters don't come alive despite all those details. They don't feel like people, just mouthpieces for views on hysteria and art. No matter what, I just didn't care about any of the characters. And even as a novel of ideas, I think this one would fail. The ideas are not developed, they're described like self-gratification, something you may take from a friend but not someone you don't care about. So, clearly I didn't like this one. I would just like to understand what I missed that made all those others love the book so much 
 When I first saw the previews, I thought that it looked very interesting and could be a good movie...of course, I thought the same about White Noise.  I guess the lesson here is that Hollywood has trouble making a good movie from beginning to end (like The Sixth Sense).  I think Hollywood is more interested in making a good TRAILER than they are a good movie so they can make a lot of money in the box office.  The Forgotten is no exception.  The first half an hour or so is very good and Joseph Ruben creates a creepy atmosphere with good performances from Julianne Moore and Dominic West.  However, the movie quickly begins to fall apart (like White Noise) and becomes less and less believable.  I was hoping for a logical explanation, especially since the box of the movie read: "The biggest jaw-dropper since The Sixth Sense."  However, the explanation is flimsy and unrealistic and my jaw only dropped at how ridiculous it was.  Nothing at all like when the ending came for Sixth Sense.  I bought this movie for $2 so I can't complain but so much, but am still amazed at Hollywood still struggles to make an entertaining, cohesive movie without so many holes.  The only thing that is "forgotten" is I have forgotten when creepy, psychological movies were good 
 I had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews. I used the razor as directed in the instruction manual. The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product 
 It is not so much that I did not think the plot plausable, but the characterizations are untrue to the original book.  I feel not enough time and care was taken to move the plot within the parameters of the characters as set by JA.  Miss Darcy, although entertaining, becomes a pale shade of Elizabeth Bennett.  Lady Catherine becomes flaccidly comic (has she become a vicar or even transposed with Mr Collins?)  It pains me also to see the most interesting and engaging characters of Elizabeth and Darcy pushed so far into the background.  I also take issue with the use of Lizzy and Fitzwilliam as the familiar names the couple uses when refering to each other.  I am almost certain that Elizabeth would always be Elizabeth in Darcy's eyes and that none of the characters in P&P would have used anything but Darcy's surname.  All of this censure aside, it was a good attempt.  I thought the phrasing and meter of the work to pay homage to Austen.  I also admire the care taken in research of the subject matter and time period.  I would recommend this book as what it is aptly titled ":An Entertainment" 
 The "victim" approach is not acceptable when you're a discovered liar.  This book is nothing more than an attempt to blame the entire Blair disaster on something or someone other than himself.  His actions are because he is black, pressured, a drug user, depressed, etc.  Reality should set in now, he did what he did because he is a sociopathic liar.  If you want to read a book that gives you insight into nothing, this is a good choice.  
 I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum 
 This is one of those films I've been waiting to see for years.  Almost 27 years.  I love Disney, including their live-action films.  I'm a sci-fi fan.  I'm fascinated by the idea and theory of black holes.  Over the years, I've come to be a fan of Robert Forster, and I like the rest of the cast alright insofar as I'm familiar with their work.  Maybe it was all the anticipation, but I was extremely disappointed on finally watching The Black Hole.  It's pretty much a mess that's transparently derivative of a number of other films.  It feels like calculated product when you watch it.  And it has a very odd cast for a sci-fi film.  That could be a pleasant surprise, but here, it never stops feeling odd.  You get the feeling that everyone got lost on their way to sets for other films.  Or that it was some kind of quirky practical joke.  The script is another big problem.  You're plopped into the middle of the lives of a crew exploring deep space in a modest ship with little exposition.  We don't know when this is supposed to be, what the crew is supposed to be doing, really, or what their relationships are.  We just get plunged into a dilemma with lots of gobbledy-gooky dialogue and the kind of sci-fi physics for which many people would have nominated Armageddon (1998) for a Razzie, if only that were a category.  Of course, I don't mind fictional physics, but the spinning and lurching and all kinds of other, later events just tended to be ridiculous in a way that I wouldn't call "good".  In any event, I could have lived with that, and even with having to fill in big gaps of exposition inferentially, but there are other aspects of the script and the film in general that are more difficult to smooth over.  One thing that really drove me crazy was the floating R2-D2-ish robot whose speech capabilities consisted almost entirely of somewhat obliquely selected Bartlett's Quotations and clichés.  Robert Forster's character kept saying, "Right", in response to these, as if the robot had just explained some complicated scientific principle or otherwise said something profound.  Other people and robots got into the Bartlett's and clichés act later.  The script references a couple more technical aspects of black hole theory, like Einstein-Rosen Bridges, so someone had to at least crack open a book or a Scientific American article on black holes.  But not only is this mixed with the ridiculous literary pretense, but certain characters can communicate with each other via ESP, and this turns out to be a plot hinge later on.  So it's kinda new-age-fi as much as sci-fi.  Many elements and even entire scenes are "borrowed" from popular films.  For example, the robots, androids, and the atmosphere and militarism of Reinhardt's ship are straight out of Star Wars (1977), with a touch of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954).  The ending is straight out of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), ridiculously enough.  To its credit, The Black Hole managed to beat Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) by two years with what's essentially the "giant boulder scene", but that's not much to credit it with, especially given how much better Steven Spielberg uses the idea.  Unlike many other films, The Black Hole does not feel like it's paying homage to artistic influences in the above references.  It feels merely like it's trying to ape content that was commercially successful, to hopefully catch the tail end of a trend or two.  Similarly, there was an attempt to make two of the robots, V.I.N.CENT. and Bob, "cutesy" in a way that would especially appeal to kids.  Vincent likes to do loop-de-loops while he flies about uttering his bad dialogue and generally acting like a speech-capable R2-D2, with a similarly spinning "head" and various extensible and retractable gadgets.  More than cutesy, a lot of this and other material winds up being unintentionally humorous.  This is also true of the action sequences, such as the fight against the robots who can normally shoot moving targets with incredible predictive powers and accuracy, but when it's really important, who suddenly are unable to do anything but stand there like sitting ducks.  I just realized I haven't said anything at all positive about the film.  Hmmmm . . . well, even though it's pretty mucked up, the basic ideas in the film are intriguing--you can see them gleaming through the thick fog.  There is a lot of admirable visual design throughout.  I'm enough of a fan of Robert Forster that I still liked him here, despite the odd fit with the material, and Ernest Borgnine may seem lost, but he's a lot of fun--maybe because he seems lost.  If you watch The Black Hole in the right frame of mind, it's a pretty decent "So bad, it's good" film 
 I can not write a strong enough criticism of this book. It holds itself out to be informative self-help, but in reality it is part fiction and part fairy tale.  The book is based loosely on what Mr. Ellison has dubbed the Theory of Statistical Propensity. Mr. Ellison (whom it should be noted at this point has the mathematical credentials of a short order cook) stews up his bland theory by reheating the old Gambler's Fallacy - a meritless contention that numbers on the dice, the roulette wheel, or whatever contraption you are currently losing your rent on, are somehow "due to hit." He dresses it up as a mathematical theory but it is in fact the same old fool's notion: That random numbers appear in patterns and that the laws of probability run hot and cold.  Had Mr. Ellison not dozed off in high school math class, he would know that the reason numbers tend to even out to the statistical mean over time is that larger and larger sample sizes help to smooth out apparent statistical inequities.  For example: if you flip a coin one hundred times, it's entirely possible that every single flip will land on heads. That's 100% for heads. Now flip one hundred additional times and you might get an even split, 50 head and 50 tails. That brings our total heads count to 50 heads out of 200. Still a significant 75% heads advantage, but closer to the inherent 50% probability than before, no?   Now flip that coin another 1,000,000 times.   When you finally build up a significant enough sample size (1,000,000, in our example) a measly 150 flip head advantage is de minimus. Heck a heads advantage of 10,000 barely moves the needle. That's why numbers draw to a statistical average, Mr. Ellison, not by some cosmic force pulling the coin in one direction or another. It's why a casino can run a profitable business with games where the house advantage is a slim 2% or less. You may walk out a winner one day, every day one week, even every day one whole lucky year. But keep pressing that improbability and you will find over time the sample size will start to work against you and you will lose. Its not some genie in the dice, it's called "regression to statistical mean". Google it.  Aside from his Intelligent Design Theory of Dice, Mr. Ellison imparts the following gems of wisdom: - If your dice hit chips during a throw the probability of rolling a 7 is statistically increased. - If the stickman changes, the probability of throwing a 7 next roll is statistically increased. -If your dice accidenatlly go off of the table, the probability of throwing a 7 is statistically increased.  Again, Mr. Ellison doesn't bother to do any critical thinking here. He fails to step back from his own delusions and recognize these triggers for what they are: memorable events outside of the normal course of play - anchors that his tiny mind can recognize, glom on and refer back to. It is much more convenient to pick up on these memorable cues than the millions of other variables which simply fail to capture his attention. Does the dice thrower put his weight on his right or left leg during the throw? Is there an odd or even dollar amount of money being wagered this throw by the third person on the left? These are events that have just as much impact on the random throw of the dice. I wonder why he his attention isn't drawn to these peculiarities? Could it be he's just not that creative? Or is it rather that these events, just like the ones he cites, don't have any impact on the roll at all?  When I purchased this book I wanted an intelligent discussion about the mathematical odds of each wager and some traditional patterns of betting to crib off of. What I got was a 200+ pages of superstition and snarky barbs at the recognized authorities in the field who did not return his emails and calls (with good reason, it turns out).  If I had more time I would write 200+ pages of my own, and that wouldn't even begin to describe all of the reasons why you SHOULD NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 Craig Winn is a money hungry businessman.  After 911, he made a goal to make millions of dollars by lying about Islam.  Don't be fooled by this guy 
 The first problem with this book is the cover. It depict the two names of God and the prophet intertwined together, like two equal entities, creating a sense of unity.  This design tells a lot about Sufi thought, which  elaborates on man's journey towards his Creator until he reaches the final  state of unity, at which point he becomes at the highest state of being.   And thus he is looked up to by others in 'subordinate' stages as a person  through which God communicates with them.  To any devout Muslim, this is  pure heresy. One of the main objectives of Islam was to purify faith from  the 'other' in man's relationship with his Creator.      The second problem  with this book is its preset assumption that Sufism is an Islamic concept.   For anyone familiar with the everyday life of the prophet and his  companions, it is clear that they had no time to sit and meditate over  which 'station' of knowledge or literal advancement towards God they were  at (in fact, they never viewed themselves as being the best or the most  knowledgeable, knowing that whoever thought of himself as such had probably  claimed authority over matters known only to God).  There were more  important things set down from God for them and subsequently, for all  muslims.  Those were clearly set out and, to find out about them, all you  have to do is just read the Quran.  The prophet had a mission to humanity  and his companions followed in his footsteps.  They were to accomplish it  exactly as God had ordered them, there was neither the desire, nor the  room, to come up with man made ideologies and to distract themselves from  God's clearly defined commands.       Those people were NOT saints, for  Islam does not acknowledge sainthood.  If they were all a group of mystics,  their minds would have been too clouded with problems of knowledge and  existence that no civilization would have been built in the first place.       As the case is with most Sufi readings, reference is hardly to the  companions of the prophet or to names like Ibn Qayyim, Ibn Taymiya, Malek,  Abu Hanifa, or Shafei.  It is in the writings of those that a reader will  find the fulfilling spiritual aspect of Islam.  All that readers find,  however, is 'saints,' or mystic scholars whose writings, as known to all  Muslim scholars, sharply deviate from the teachings of Orthodox Islam found  in the Quran and in the sayings of the prophet (pbuh).      Finally, it is  important to note that the often praised Sheikh Ghazali, considered by  Sufis as the founder of Sufism and, to whom reference is indeed abundant in  many Sufi texts, had himself changed much of his ideas near the end of his  life and had in fact complied more closely to the teachings of Orthodox  Islam 
 ...but I've suggested to some people that a name for this author that might be more appropriate would be Boris Lessing, as in BOOOOR-ING. Admittedly, I've only made it through 30 pages of this book but the  experience has been akin to watching paint dry while enduring a root canal.  I'd like to think I've the patience and the refined sensibilities to  appreciate the meandering pace and voyages into the lost depths of opaque  stream-of-consciousness prose, but I suppose I have a low tolerance for  pain... or maybe I'm jaded, in this day and age, where psychology is  simultaneously applauded and disregarded, conspiracy theorists have  appropriated the whole 'extra-terrestrial encounter' thing and television  has whittled my attention span to near zero... either way, this book  doesn't contribute much to my appreciation for poetry or science-fiction -  or the theater for that matter, given that much of the dialogue is written  as if it's to be performed in a play. A case of a text attempting to  transcend too many boundaries? In any case, not a book I would recommend 
 The music is way too "synthy" for me.  In many cases the "band" sounds like a synthesizer and a drum box.  Many of the lyrics are inane.  Lou's voice seems ok.  My 8 year old likes it a lot.  The songs have a certain pop catchiness to them, but there just isn't much depth there.  I have a hard time believing that this is the king of mambo.  I certeinly wish that I was as studly as he is 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 Complete waste of money!  I bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it!  After several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed.  Now the darn thing does not respond to her answers.  Even when I clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register.  Complete waste of Money!!!!  Would not recommend to anyone!  Save your money and play with a rock, much more fun 
 Any attempt to display Karl Marx as a sympathetic prophet mustfail if one is marginally familier with his story. The real Marx, assketched out by Paul Johnson in his wonderful book Intellectuals, was a disasater as a human being,which no doubt fueled his resentment against capitalism. If you read Zinn's comments about this play, you will see the same resentment at work. I have no doubts that Zinn's parents worked hard. HARD work , however, is NOT the source of wealth. I could spend years trying to empty the Atlantic ocean with a shot glass. It would be very hard work, but of value to very few. Capitalism rewards hard work and hard thought that results in the creation of something valuable to large numbers of people.  Thus the production of the automobile, oil, and operating systems lead to great fortunes. I am charitable enough to admit that Marx would have been horrified by the 100 million deaths commited in his name in the 20th century, but this literary whitewash is absurd 
 I very much looked forward to the ending of this book not to see what would happen but so that I could be done with it and move on to a different book! I found this book pointless. After reading 482 pages, I can't even think of two adjectives to describe Sally and Clare. Moody does such a poor job of character development that I don't feel like I know all that much about these two women. I did not like the main characters and I didn't feel as though they had much of a real friendship at all. The book is way too long, the plot is unbelievable, the characters are unlikable, and the writing style is annoying 
 I enjoy the recipes in the back of the book.  The characters however, are extremely obnoxious, with the exception of Drayton.  Theodosia is an unlikeable busy-body, know-it-all, arrogant character who seems to be in continual competition with the police in attempting to solve crimes.  Haley is irritating beyond words.  The books are full of sentence fragments and the way the characters talk is stilted.  I've given up on this series and will go to the library, page to the back of the book and browse through the recipes.   
 The pathetic thing about scams like this is that we're all searching for ways to secure our future. The thing is, Peter Conti was a smart guy who did some real estate investing... then, he decided to become SMARTER and offer his "Secrets to Success" to everyone else for a fee!  How intelligent is that??? Be realistic people. There are no (legal) shortcuts to fortune other than hard work, inheritance, or winning the lottery. There is money to be made in real estate, and SOME gains may be as easy as he makes them look but the bulk of them are not. Am I rich? No, but I'm comfortable enough NOT to be willing to make someone ELSE RICH by buying products that only sell dreams. Due TRUE research people. Go to CNN.COM and look under Money. They have GREAT savings tips.. great investment tips.. Go to Fidelity.com... Don't make people like THIS Rich *RICHER* in the process. Honestly... any of us can take his book.. reword a few things.. write our own book... and sell some Dreams. Its pathetic. All these GET RICH schemes are designed to get the WRITER rich, NOT YOU! When you're up late at night watching TV and see all these bogus infomercials, turn the channel... Watch Nick @ Nite, anything but the "Dream Sellers". Invest your time and money in things that you can be proud of. Do TRUE research, don't follow behind someone who's only interested in "how much money you're willing to invest in your future" AKA "are you willing to pay for the next seminar because this initial free one is replay of the infomercial you saw on tv." It's designed to get you HYPED UP.  And how do I know?  Well, I've never been to one myself, but I asked my roommate to go to one on "Our" behalf... U know, just to check it out and bring back some Great Information!  Well, "Yeah Right" is an understatement... No great info, just a repeat of the infomercial and a list of prices for the "Upcoming Events." And myself, what I've done, is ordered information about an at-home business that supposedly required "No Selling" (How unrealistic right?) Well the whole thing was, you create a website and let the website sell the product for you... but how likely is that?  I mean, of course you gotta put some effort into it and ultimately you're doing what - SELLING. So luckily I only wasted $50, but some people waste hundreds even thousands on this type of stuff... Don't but the HYPE people. Don't buy it. Just accept that everyone in life is not going to have a mercedes and a $500,00 home... but if you really want it, work hard for it. Put in the time, the effort, and the research... there are honest ways of making a good future but you have to be patient.  And again, I say, do not follow the Dream Sellers like Carlton Sheets, Russ Whitney, Peter Conti and all the others.. unless you have a strong desire to help Them get Richer while you look on in awe 
 This isn't a kids book at all. The message behind it is one of choice, making reference to a woman's right to choose through horton and the planet. I don't care what your views on abortion are (anti or pro), you shouldn't let young children read and decyfer the hidden meaning. Dr. Seuss was a nut job and a child corrupter, don't support his work.  
  Republocrat zombies on the march Heil Bush they chant with glassy eyes Stomp out freedom Subvert the Constitution for their corporate masters Force their fascist god-book down everybody's throats Stare at the tv, it'll all be ok they say Turn off your mind Become infantile like us Soulless neo-con automatons Mindless Flag wavers Memetic slaves of the Dark Lord Bus 
 From the moment Celeste met her adoptive's father father...I knew there would be trouble. Not only didn't we find out if she were pregnant...which would have made for an interesting twist...she never heard from the boy she gave her virginity to again! I was really disappointed in this story 
  this anime seems indifferent to me. It should be better to play lineage or something than whatch an anime who deals with characters in a online game. Can't say bad or good only that it doesn't interest me into watching the whole series...too childish mayb 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 THIS MOVIE IS NOT VULGAR NOR DOES IT RATE NC17...DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE. CHECK OUT PINK FLAMINGOS INSTEAD, NOW THAT IS A VULGARLY RIGHTEOUS MOVIE BY WATERS AND THE WITH THE GODDESS OF FILTH..DEVINE 
 Amazon is out of RED.  After waiting for 2 months, they shipped a white while the packing list states red.  When contacted, they said that they do not have a red for replacement.  If I want a white I can get it elsewhere for $7.99.  Not I have to go through the trouble of returning it 
 Was hoping to read an unbiased history of the conflict in the Middle East.  Instead entire book is so heavily slanted toward Israel that had to put it down after a few chapters.  If you are genuinely trying to educate yourself about this important region, don't bother purchasing this book.  Just more pro-Israel rhetoric 
 The authors' claims are based on a flawed research project.  They  did before-and-after measurements of driving distance, and found that all eight golfers increased their distance after doing the static  exercise program.  But almost all of the gains were less than ten yards; only one had the 30-yard gain that is mentioned in the book cover hype.  The problem with the research is that it did not include a control group that did everything else the same but did not do the special exercises.  The reported gains might have been due to nonspecific effects such as increased concentration or increased confidence.  Also, the actual time to do the exercises is a good deal more than two minutes a day: two minutes is the total time with tense muscles, but after each exercise you have to rest, move to another station, change weights, etc.  Bottom line:  If you are seriously out of shape, probably any kind of exercise will be better than none.  If you want to improve your driving distance, take a lesson and cure your slice 
 This is my first review ever on Amazon. I currently about 1/3rd through the first book, and it has taken me about three months to get that far.  I honestly do not understand the praise attributed to the book. The story just doesn't flow for me, the author riddles the chapters with pointless thoughts from side characters, that serve no purpose in advancing the plot.  I do not even think the book began well. Maybe it is a cultural thing, but... The Seneschal - In history was an adviser to a King, or an officer of important nobles. It is hard for me to translate this into a religious sect. The King's privy chamber - Yes I know privy means private, etc, but all I could think about, when the book mentioned the privy chamber, was a bathroom, I don't know why, but that is what came to mind.  Maybe I am spoiled, but this is a list of authors that I can think of off the top of my head that people would be better off spending there money on. George RR Martin CJ Cherryh Robert Jordan Orson Scott Card RA Salvatore (simple but entertaining and easy to read) David Eddgings Terry Brooks  Updated: My 18 month old got a hold of this book and shredded some pages before I finished, and I don't even care. That is how bad it is 
 I have always been a fan of fighting games.  As far as 3D ones go, I have great experience in the Dead or Alive series and proficiency with Soul Calibur 2.  I fear that Dead or Alive and Soul Calibur may have spoiled me though.  Recently I bought Mortal Kombat Deception and found it horribly awkward* compared to the fluid battles of Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive.  I felt the same way when I played Tekken 5.  Unlike the graceful and awesome animations of Dead or Alive or Soul Calibur, the movements of the characters in Tekken 5 are unrealistic and absurd.  Try out Christie in Tekken 5 for example.  Her idle animation is preposterous.  If you have access to Dead or Alive 3, try putting out Leifang.  Her idle animation is a thing of beauty.  Every one of her moves flows perfectly from one to the next.  This kind of grace is seriously lacking in the clunky Tekken 5.  And now let us speak of character design.  Tekken 5's characters are boring and uninspired.  They run the gamut from miscellaneous boxer 1, 2, 3, and 4, to miscellaneous karate fighter 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Oh.  There are also a few shrieky girls in tight clothing, some of which seem to be Asian, if that's your thing.  And then there's a guy in a cat mask.  As awesome as that sounds, it looks silly in the game.  If you have ever played Practice Mode on Dead or Alive you will probably recall with fondness that there is a feature that shows each move command at the top of the screen and keeps it there until you successfully perform that move.  This feature, as useful as it is, is not present in Tekken 5.  To be fair, it isn't found in any other fighting game that I have played, but it really should be.  Without further ado, let me simply say that I do not recommend buying Tekken 5 if you have ever played Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive.  The intro video is about as much excitement as the game can offer (I especially enjoyed the suicidal bicycle girl that rescued the kitten).   *But at least Mortal Kombat Deception had Puzzle Kombat, which rocked my socks 
 I was initially delighted to stumble upon this new series.  I love the premise of an older protagonist and the Cotswold setting; I even loved the cover.  Imagine my shock when I got to page 158 and read the following dialogue as spoken by one of the characters:  ".... the circumstances perfectly obeyed the rites of Wicca.  He had been impaled by a pitchfork through the throat, pinned to the ground so his blood would flow into the soil, to nourish it -"  I don't know what sources Ms. Harwin utilized in her writing of this novel, but as a practitioner of Wicca myself for 15 years, I can attest to the fact that nowhere in our religion does impaling - or ANY kind of bloodletting - "obey the rites of Wicca".  In fact it is quite the opposite, as the first and foremost rule of Wicca is `Harm None'.  Wicca is a defined, well-documented religion with very specific principles and practices, with strict rules against harming anyone, EVER.      Before I reached that page I'd actually been in Barnes and Noble earlier that day looking for a copy of the next in the series.  They didn't have it, and now I'm glad they didn't.    Harwin's careless, uneducated passing comments in this book are not only offensive but extremely irresponsible. I don't know when I've been more disappointed in a writer.  I'm sorry that this promising series has now been ruined for me. 
 This is the Jurassic Park mentality of dealing with xenophobia. You just treat the Japanese or any other foreigner with the same awe and fear that you first saw (or even read) the CGI dinosaurs in Spielberg's blockbuster.  Crichton's novel is essentially a pot-boiler of a homicide thriller. To make it sound more exotic, he added a Japanese-cum-American rivalry context with any a healthy dose of "yellow fever" and xenophobia thrown in.  Sean Connery "water walks" through his usual role of the umpteenth time of being a master detective with a younger co-star being tagged along. He has seen better days. (Namely, The Name of the Rose and The Untouchables). Frankly speaking, he could have had just played Sherlock Holmes and get it done and over with.   Connery plays a so-called legendary cop who is trained in the way of the Japanese culture. So, he more or less knows a thing or two about the Japanese. Wesley Snipes, acts as a hot-headed "fool" of a co-star who fumbles and tumbles till Connery rescues him in the Highland way.   The fact that the kung fu action scenes are being inserted sparsely throughout the movie shows that the director, Philip Kaufman is using martial arts as an alarm clock to wake any uninterested audience members who dozed off in his convoluted plot.  Tia Carrera in another thankless role that requires her to draw upon her Asian background to act as a foil for both stars. The ending in regards to her is so lame and in fact ambiguous speaks for the rest of the movie. It remains respectful and xenophobic about the Japanese at the same time, that the movie doesn't know who or what it is, and this turns out to be an identity crisis, in terms of plot and direction 
 I bought it because of Robert deniro and the low price. It wasnt worth it. The picture quality is horrible, it looks like a bad tape... the color is constantly changing and the picture is very grainy. The sound is nothing to brag about. And besides all of that, the movie sucks. Robert Deniro has a total of about 2 minutes of screen time, and he says maybe less then 10 lines.  And whats even worse than that- the dvd that I bought had a picture of Deniro that wasnt even from this movie! sat away from this one, spend a little more a better movie 
 My young child didn't have a clue what this book was about.  Beyond that, this story is just not my style. The troll in the book talks like this, " You need a reality check, junior" or "I want my money you four-legged buttinskis" or "Just show me the money". This book is quite a bit too contemporary in heart and style for my taste. 
 The book should cost not more then $20 based on the information contained.  Much of the information is either watered down or appears in his first book.  Needless to say I was not impressed with the book 
 Any attempt to analyze the Hemingway/Fitzgerald friendship involves (at best) pure speculation and (at worst) cheap psychology. This book offers equal measures of both. Devotees of either of the two legendary authors  will no doubt already be familiar with the anecdotes recounted in Hemingway  vs. Fitzgerald. For them, this book is a dry well. (And who, besides this  group, would be interested in the book in the first place? 
 Jane Fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful, if opinonated (remember Hanoi Jane?), woman.  I watched this as a teenager and despite the "striptease" this has to be one of her worst.  Hormones be damned, watching this was a waste of time.  If you like Fonda, try Klute.  She was an excellent actress --- but no one could survive this mess.      
 Very poor quality, falling apart at the seams. Also really long. 
 Another unnecessary tome of the "publish or perish" variety. It merely documents that the author has identified and consulted written accounts of the phenomenon from the last 150 years and patched together a narrative that is very much of the cut-and-paste variety. No original research is evidenced; and where the author had the opportunity to correct gross errors of fact in sources quoted, it's just too much bother. To wit: on p. 237, "La Goulue...still there in the 1930s... In the background..stands an old man...Valentin-le-Désossé, her old dancing partner." Well, La Goulue was dead by early 1929 (30 Jan. to be exact), and her partner Valentin had slipped back into the perfectly bourgeois existence that he emerged from - to die in 1907. On p. 246, Mrs. Wilson gives us two paragraphs on a "certain" Dr. Walter Serner (1889-1942). She appears to know nothing about him as a writer (of brilliantly unique short stories), but insists that he eventually disappears in the Soviet Union, "perhaps in search of the bohemian's always elusive utopia". This romanticizing nonsense is especially galling, considering that Serner suffered the usual fate the Nazis had in store for Jews: he and his wife were arrested in Prague in 1942 and murdered a few months later, probably in Auschwitz.  The author's website tells us that she has written an autobiography at age 45, and is a feminist, lesbian and social activist. I'd say stick to it 
 In my opinion this book deal with the surface of a real basic concept in Jazz improvisation. Unfortunately the triadic concepte is here  explained through really weak and cheap examples: there are few good lines transcripted from guitar masters but Fewell's example are for the most terrible! 
 It is very repetative and over simplified. He does make his point, then again, then again. While his one point was interesting, it's not worth the book. I read this book a few years back. Now that I have been more involved in the market, I can say that the book has contributed nothing to my experience. 
 This book, based on Freudian theories, is not for the average parent.  The author blames parents for all of the problelms their children may be having in school. She completely ignores the realities of external social forces, including poverty, community culture and the existance of BAD teachers.  Unless a parent has the advantage of having read other theoretical works, they might accept this bunch of parent blaming junk 
 I borrowed the audio book set of this book, not knowing anything about its author or his political views, hoping to get a greater insight into the minds of the founding fathers.  Unfortunately what I found to be the most prominent subject matter of this work was the anti-Bush/Republican propaganda.  Now, I do take exception with many of the policies and stances of the current U.S. presidency, however, if I wanted to research the effecacious practices of the current presidency I would have rather borrowed from my library a politically motivated work.  I, for one, find no place for such subjectiveness in a work on what is supposedly historical truth.  I prefer my history books to simply contain history, not political commentary 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 I read this book for a college lit. class.  I don't even know what to say, this is a waste of paper! 
 Bok begins his book in a manner similar to a historian, revisit antiquity, become oblivious to why it failed to survive said antiquity, and proclaim its fortunes and virtues; however, Bok opens with the rather sheepish statement that colleges never have been overachieving and students never involuntarily choose work.  In short, there was no golden age of collegiate education.  Bok's writing is a bit of an enigma throughout the book.  One moment he has nothing but praise for modern research in educational methods, the next moment he says the same research is unreliable and colleges should engage in their own self-study and ideological changes.   Bok does make the rather insightful comment (in any other age I would say painfully obvious ) that if colleges want students to write more eloquently and speak more loquaciously then they should be taught by people who speak and write well.  Put their money where their mouth is so to speak. Bok proceeds to analyze a smorgasbord of educational methods, the only one of which has any supporting benefits, a study of the great literature of civilization. He quickly dismisses this because he thinks the study is too broad focused. (Bok also thinks knowledge of statistics is more important than reason and causality, a point made painfully clear by his lack of causal understanding throughout the book.)  Bok refuses to mention who educational changes really help, do they help the best students or the worst students?  Who should you help?  Bok's narrow-mindedness on science is annoyingly deplorable.  At a faculty meeting he stated undergraduate science surveys should allow the understanding of science and nature journals.  A Nobel prize winner in chemistry told him that even he did not understand those journals! Bok really wants colleges to do more, achieve something; however he refuses to make clear what exact goals a college should have and worse yet, he refuses to acknowledge any attempt to provide a yardstick to measure progress.  In such, he spends the greater part of the book lamenting that colleges need to do something to improve, and once they do the education research will tell them why it worked. 
 It won't let you print...  In other words, you have to be in front of a computer to read this book (I know it is an e-book, but it would be nice to be able to print out a few pages to read at the doctor's office or on the plane).  In additon, the layout is incomplete, there are no items associated with the index topics, the pictures are slow to load, and look third rate, etc.  Another little problem is that the book can only ever be read from two computers.  I travel for work, so I am "stuck" with the first two computers I read it on.    I am really dissapointed, and I will be contacting amazon regarding a refund 
 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 What were they trying to do?  I mean c'mon either they were stupid and bought a crappy camera and got really really bad actors, and they try to remake some of the scenes, oh my god.  This movie sucks its at the bottom of my movie list. I rather lick the seat of a toilet in a public bathroom than watch this movie again. It is nothing I repeat NOTHING compared to the awsome american hit classic movie Maximum Overdrive ***** 5 STARS, OH YEAH!! 
 I bought this book based on the great reviews from other customers. But, I don't see what they see. I see parents and kids wearing clothes from the  early 80's and information that can't possibly be more basic. There's  nothing wrong with the basics, but there are plenty of books that give the  basics and more in a creative and entertaining way. Well ... at least it  was cheap 
 I was quite disappointed with this one.  First of all the book's ending is very grim.  I agree with another reviewer when they said they'd rather be left imagining what kind of messes Arthur and Ford were getting themselves into now.  And so many unanswered questions!  What happened to Fenchurch and why didn't Arthur care more about what happened to her?  What happened to Zaphod?  Colin the robot?  What is the question to the answer 42?  What was Fenchurch's idea that would solve the world's problems?  What was the point to the people on Rupert?  It's worth reading just to be able to finish off the series and because it's still well written and funny just like the others.  But be prepared to be disappointed by the loose ends and finale.  
   Greene is a conman, you dopes! You're being set up to buy this watered down Machiavellian compost, using the 50% of his "laws" that don't contradict the other 50%.   He gets you to believe that your selfishness and aspirations to megalomania you possess are justified, desirable, and trustworthy. You're all going to die, sorry. Try to imagine what they'll be saying at your funeral, no matter how rich and powerful you (in your dreams) become by using the self-contradicting nonsense in this book. "Man, what a selfish prick" would certainly be among the most commonly heard expressions of sentiment.  
 Typical of the war movies of that age.  Very much the Americans are all good clean kids who will overcome injustice.  I enjoyed looking at an America that was.  Would purchase again but this is not a documentary or even a close approximation of real life 
 I can only thank the good Lord that we have Sanford Levinson to correct the fools who thought that they had a workable document that only got us through a bit under 250 years.  Too bad he wasn't around back then--I'm sure that the Founding Fathers would have sat up and taken notice of his clearly superior genius.  Or maybe not.  Too bad I had to give a book at least one star.  But then maybe Mr. Levinson will correct that glaring deficiency, too 
 This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed.  Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this book 
 Dear Sean,  Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.  All my best,  Bill  PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced 
 How can a collection featuring Yma Sumac, Townes Van Zandt, Nina Simone and Moondog get only 2 stars, because of Kenny Rogers & the 1st Edition. This version of the song sucks, and the scene in the movie sucked. Edit this self indulgant dreck out of both and they rate higher 
 Along Came Polly is so silly and annoying but of course the lovely Jennifer Aniston makes this film almost worth while. I probably would have turned this movie off if it wasn't for her. Aniston has charisma so even in a crummy movie like this one, she tries to make an awkward situation somewhat ok. Ben Stiller is another story, he always picks the same, stereotypical role. I guess Stiller thinks he is not worth a decent part. Oh well, Along Came Polly will not send me on a second viewing anytime soon. I recommend The Good Girl or Reality Bites instead 
 We just received this golf set in the mail, and were so excited.  My almost-three daughter and I wanted it to play inside on rainy spring days.  Both handles came out of both foam clubheads the second time we used the set.  We only used the clubs and set for playing golf inside, and the set was used a total of about 20 minutes.  This set is rated for ages 3-7.  I don't see how it could hold up to a seven year old when my almost-three daughter broke it on its second use.  We are sending this set back today, and ordered the Little Tikes set this morning 
 I can respect director Adam Marcus for trying to pull away from the series and do something different, but we already had the BS Ft13th movie: Part V.  Jason wasn't the killer.  Technically, Jason is the killer in this movie, but it's not really.  You'll see what I mean when you see the movie, and it is worth a see, but by the 7th or 8th movie, they were movies for the fans.  They stopped making them to be innovative by the 5th movie and were just making them to make money and entertain the audience.  Adam Marcus wanted to be innovative with Jason Goes to Hell, and it doesn't work.  Not for fans or an average audience.  There's nothing interesting about seeing random people who act like Jason walking around and killing people, not to mention WITHOUT the trademark machete.  They could've at least given these people a little personality with the machete, but whoever called that one thought they were doing the series a favor.  The introduction of Jason having a sibling, niece, and now a great niece (I think?) by the 9th movie in the series is a little too late, sorry.  We would've had to know about these people by at least the 3rd or 4th movie to make us care about their struggle.  Another thing:  Jason as a snake/demon creature crawling around the floor?  Hmm... I wasn't under the impression that Jason was really evil in the first place.  Let me explain:  Jason has been made out to be mentally/physically disabled.  If Ginny in Part 2 was able to convince him that she was his mother by wearing her sweater, than Jason isn't evil at all, he just loves his mom and kills all the victims because he believes that they're responsible.  So, Jason as a wierd little hell creature doesn't necessarily work when bringing it into the context of the other movies.  The design of Jason's actual appearances in the movie doesn't make sense either.  What happened between part 8 and 9 to get his mask somehow buried and melded into his face?  Why does he look fat?  Where did his hair come from?  At least Part 8 had some respect for the look and personality of Jason, while it might not have been the best in the series it was at least satisfying to see him the way we know him, and not make drastic changes which don't even benefit his appearance.  Adam Marcus, I can respect you for trying to make your own movie, and yeah, it's definately yours.  Don't try and make your own movie the 9th movie in a series of movies that are about the fans, and don't BS the fans with your idea of an improvement of the series.  I'd say, fans should see this movie just to see it.  It's worth the view and the surprise cameo at the end.  *wink* 
 I want my 78 minutes back! Spare yourself - don't buy this cruddy film, and don't waste your time watching it.  Think of all the wonderful things you could do in 78 minutes.  Call me old fashioned, but I have this little hang up about a movie having a plot and having structure.  This is a desperate attempt to be artsy, which simply comes off as a bunch of film students fooling around trying to do something weird.  Endless repeated scenes with small variations, a "mystery" that really isn't much of one.  Courtney Cox wearing awful clothes and ugly glasses and endless closeups of her looking gaunt and haggard to the point where I wanted to offer her a sandwich or something.  Dreary acting, dreary music.  Creakingly obvious attempts to be artistic by shooting portions of the film in bilious green or dreary blue.  The same material recycled endlessly to the point where I hated all the characters, and didn't give a damn what happened to any of them.  Making a film without a single likeable character is a big boo-boo.  If the audience doesn't care, they might not hang around until the end, and if they do, they'll feel as if they've wasted their time.  As Hannibal Lecter would say, tedious, very tedious 
 This book has not been updated for the new microwave ovens of today. Although the recipes are satisfactory the cooking times can't be used. The food would be cooked into a brick. Needless to say, this book should be rewritten 
 I thought Silicon Valley was for smart people. A Stanford professor and a retired Cisco executive have managed to write one of the most indecipherable business tombs in recent memory. I was asked to review this book for graduate school and I found it mostly incoherent business babble. "Billiard Ball Management." "Shallowly Rooted Strategic Vectors." "Kinetic Structures Prevail." What kinds of business leaders talk like that today? I often find the best business books package challenging business problems with no non-sense solutions. Save your money. This book is a tower of babble 
 I purchased the book based on Dr Weil's endorsement. They may be good personal trainers but the book is impractical 
 Horribly disappointing.  These manufactured dialogues are evidently Stephen Law's way of dealing with his personal problems with religion.  For example, in one chapter Law manipulates his "teaching" by having God contradict the Bible (the assumption being God's the author) in a dialogue with a conservative religious person. Law even sarcastically concludes the chapter by saying this dialogue is only a dream, the real God would probably respond differently.  Good idea for a book, ruined by the authors distorted logic. There are numerous ad hominen and circular reasoning errors.  The title and premise fooled me into reading it.  Mr. Law, how will you pay back the readers for wasting the time they invested in your philosphical rant against religion 
 BAsed on some good and some bad reviews, I bought the book to see for myself.  Let's just say I gave the book away for free, because it's not worth the bookshelf space.  If you really know anything about voip security, you'll know this book is a waste.  It's not technically wrong, but it's easy to be not wrong when you don't say much.  You can learn more from NIST and vendor docs than from this book.  My respect for CISSPs dropped after reading their positive reviews of this book 
 There are many reasons why I gave this film a low rating.  From a Christian perspective, the "God-talk" in the movie is very, very weak.  Nothing really biblical or even spiritually moving is presented.  There is no mention of Jesus or salvation.  Other reviewers have mentioned the bad language and some objectionable outfits/relationships.  On to the plot:  again, weak.  The "legendary" coach is simply a very bad coach.  He yells, constantly loses his temper, violates his own advice on the field, puts his players at risk of serious injury, and ridiculously cuts his football team to a minimum of players by throwing people off the field for - of all things, not joining in a brawl!  When he "changes" later in the film, the change isn't clear enough or shown enough to really make us believe in character development.  The football action isn't that good.  A lot of up-close cut scenes, without a good feel for actual football.  The overall message of the film is slightly confused.  Teamwork?  (After ruthlessly throwing kids off the team?) Not quitting even though you are going to lose?  OK.  The town unified around a winning season?  (Yeah, but how long would that last after the school closed?)  The film tried, and some parts were moving or inspiring, but overall I just felt frustrated at what the movie could have been. 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 Vegas - a city where millions go hoping to get rich.  And for nine lucky people, that just might come true.  While playing the slots, each of these people won a special gold coin inviting them to lunch.  At the lunch, they learn they have been selected to participate in a race for $2 million dollars.  All they have to do is be the first to get to a locker in the train depot in Silver City, New Mexico.  Naturally, everyone is skeptical at first.  But what if it is true?  No one can walk away from that possibility, and they all begin to race for the money.  But set backs in the form of airport closures, car wrecks, and cows stand in their way.  Who will get there first?  The more important question to ask is, does the audience care?  In my case, the answer is no.  I kept watching, waiting for the movie to get better, but it never did.  There were a few truly laugh out loud moments, but most of the movie fell flat.  The biggest problem it had is the lack of character development.  With a running time of just under two hours, there isn't time to get to know all the characters.  Since I didn't care, I didn't find their predicaments funny.  Then there is the climax.  Instead of building on everything that had come before, it took a turn out of nowhere that wasn't even that funny.  It was more of an anti-climax that really made me feel like I had wasted my time.  The few funny moments in this movie aren't worth watching the rest of the movie to see.  Instead of wasting your time here, watch the classic that inspired it, IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD 
 This book was informative as far as explaining who some of these groups are in the middle east.  But it adds to the aggravation of being told the same old fairy tales over and over again which by now have been proven not to be the truth!  When are these people "in the know" going to get it?  
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 Don't waste your time with this, folks. This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film "Graffiti Bridge."   But if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet-shooting, then go for it 
 I have not yet received this item.  Hopefully, it is on its way.  It has been over three weeks 
 Blargh. Green Mars took a long long time to finish.  I'm talking months. Painful, depressing months, in which I would pick it off the little wall-shelf thing above my toilet, read a chapter or two while tending to my business, sigh, and put it back.  Why? Simple. Red Mars was fun, because it was a proper sci fi book, with the additional colonial political bits. Green Mars is 90% politics/talking about a revolution, and maybe 10% proper sci fi.   In short: Take a good idea, then write a sequel and make it suck. No fun here. At least, by the time Robinson started with his political-environmental social responsibility of the scientists babbling in The Years of Rice and Salt, he'd already written a thousand years of cool alternative history, so it wasn't so painful.  I dread the concept of starting Blue Mars, even though its sitting on my bookshelf right next to Red and Green. 
 After only a few uses, my trimmer simply stopped working! No, it wasn't the batteries. And I was not within the allotted time frame for returning the defective item, so I am simply "out" my money and I am not happy about it! I should be able to receive some kind of compensation for my time and money 
 first off, i'm a fan.  admittedly not as big a fan as i once was - it's a far cry from the halcyon days of music for the masses/ violator - but a fan nonetheless.  all of which makes this painful to write. a lot of people have dubbed this a return to form, a comment which does an extreme disservice to 'exciter'.  despite featuring one of the most toe-curlingly embarrassing moments of dm's history ('dead of night' - shudder - a song so bad it wouldn't have even got onto 'ultra') for all it's flaws it managed to hold the attention. this album tries to maintain a similar laidback, low key vibe to the likes of the excellent 'comatose', 'i feel loved'.  the problem with 'playing the angel' is that the tunes are somewhat...tepid.  there's very little in the way of instant tunes, and crucially it seems to be lacking in growers too.  where dm try to write a song that harks back to the glory days, they're let down by a lack of, for want of a better word, a hook.  best example of this is 'the sinner in me' which, after initial promise, limps to a chorus that falls flat in spectacular (or unspectacular, to be precise) fashion.  'precious' comes off as a poor man's 'enjoy the silence' and 'microcosm' and 'damaged people' are just, well, awful.  the rest just feel somehow half-hearted. it's not all bad.  'i want it all' and 'nothing's impossible' WORK, and 'the darkest star' gets points for trying.  despite this i can't help but feel there's an alan wilder shaped hole in the proceding 
 I wish I had read the reviews before buying this DVD set. I was stunned when I started watching the first disc and the familiar and much-loved My Life theme song was missing, and that was one of my favorite parts of the show. And had I known that these were the edited syndication episodes and not the original, I would have passed on this set and waited for a better version. This show deserved better 
 I had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and/or what looks like the droppings of crawly things. I must say I generally love Newman's products, and I was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt. With natural products, sometimes bugs get in them. That's part of the territory with organic matter. But I found white grubs and little brown dots that weren't a part of the raisins in box after shrink-wrapped box. Some boxes were fine, and I ate the raisins in them, but the majority were tainted. I'll need to be assured there's been an improvement in quality control before I try Newman's snack-pack organic raisins again 
 I skimmed through the pages and found a description by the author of how to keep track of large jigsaw puzzles (paraphrased here):  Put the puzzle together, then flip it over and number each piece.  Then store it in a large Ziploc, along with a photo cut out from the box.  Then cut out a small photo from the box and put it in a three-ring binder....etc. First of all, who does a large puzzle more than once?  And how awkward is it to store a puzzle in a bag?  And how does one pick up a large puzzle?  This is not a useful book in my opinion 
 Way too expensive for a low quality product.  The clarity of the picture is poor.  There is not enough content to justify the price.  I don't recommend it at all.  I feel I've been cheated 
 This book should have been a hard back and it isn't! I will be returning it as the order was incorrect 
 My son loved the idea of this toy and was so excited to receive it as a birthday gift.  However one club broke almost immediately and the other broke shortly after that.  It is poor quality and construction.  Don't use it unless your kids are the gentle kind.  Most kids would break this the first time.  [... 
    Just as in his book on Orson Welles, Thomson harbors an untoward lust to "get into the act" himself.  He is forever flapping his arms in front of the projector to throw his own shadow up upon the screen.      He apparently fancies himself a philosopher, so we are never far from some pompous pronunciamento:   "In America we treasure shared things, as if we had a constant fear of being helplessly divided and scattered."  "Here, by the way, is a profound contradiction in much of Americana..."etc     He is, unsurprisingly, cavalier enough about facts to expect to be allowed to breeze by with "To be quick about this part of it, the campaign of the House Committee on Un-American Activities was unconstitutional, and in its punishment, the blacklist, it was illegal."    HUAC's "campaign" itself sadly passed muster via  Congress' power to investigate just about anything it wishes to waste time on, or grandstand about.  It was the methods that offended. HUAC "punishment" was indictment for contempt of congress. The judiciary did the rest on that score, dutifully seeing several into the slam. The blacklist was exclusively the illegitimate get of The (frightened) Studios.     Worst of all about this book is that, whenever he runs out of cheap, scurrilous, time-hallowed, dirt to re-publish, Thomson concocts bitchy dish "nouveau" of his own to serve up 
 Before I begin to rant-get one thing straight. I LOVE BOARD GAMES!!! So you can imagine how bad this is, if someone like me, who owns at least 200 board games, despises it. This game is just plain stupid. Also, since I tend to get nervous when I'm on timer, hated the little hourglass, pouring sand into the bottom chamber. Please, don't throw away your hard-earned money, get yourself a fun and more worthwile game, like Trivial Pursuit, or Clue 
 If I could I would give this book no stars. I did not find anything in this book at all helpful. I bought this when I first got married in hopes that would give me some sort of insight into marriage and my husband. Now 4 years down the line, I learned this book is nothing but rubbish. Foremost I did not care for the author Kevin Leman. He seems like just your typical egotistical male writing a book with the thoughts that all women are fragile little butterflies in a cocoon and all men are barbaric sex maniacs. I am not in anyway a feminist, but unfortunately in alot of marriages the stereotypical "You Jane, Me Tarzan" does not fit. In my case, this was so, which is why this book was of little use to me. I will give it a little credit. In a way, it made me realise how lucky I was that my husband came no where near the way this guy was describing men! Maybe it is a good book for those in "typical" relationships. But, not a good book if you or your significant other falls out of the lines of the "typical" male and female behavior 
 My first adventure in investigative journalism, I was immediately captivated by the beginning: cast of characters, general overviews, and the excitement that, based on the overview of how the book was to go, it was  worth reading. The material was well written in that Mr. Moldea went into  fine and captivating detail asto what the investigators were thinking, what  EVERYONE was thinking. I was a little suspicious of the passage where he  describes visiting with Sirhan Sirhan, and given the result of the  encounter, maybe made the author a little biased asto how his investigation  would lead to. The ending left me in a completely different place, where I  believe the author's evidence lead me to. His conclusions were not anything  I had agreed with. I feel he made the evidence ultimately fit the official  version of the tragic downfall of RFK that fateful June evening in 1968 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way 
 This book doesn't really contain anything I didn't already know from books like "Empire of Debt" by Bonner and Wiggin.  The latter is a much more well researched and well written book in addition to being more current.  I would recommend it instead if you haven't read it.  This book at hand had mediocre writing and some arguments that were crankish, especially the ones regarding investing in the stock market.  It has many charts but most of them are rather obvious from the text and often unnecessary.  Much of the data tables are things anyone could crank out on a spreadsheet program with ease and are embarrassingly simplistic at times.  I do not recommend this book 
 I love Gary Null's radio program. It's so inspirational that I bought this book hoping for more of the same. Sadly, I found it one of the worst organized books I ever seen, badly edited, and full of pages and pages of superfluous "testimonials" (literally over fifty pages of insubstantial fan letters!) I'm sorry to write this because I am a fan of Gary's and appreciate what he does on the radio but I feel compelled to warn the prospective buyer away from this book 
 I cannot recommend this book versus others in the genre at similar prices. The writing is mediocre and while I appreciate the efforts on the charting the data sets are too small to be significant.  Nothing new let alone ground breaking or revolutionary 
 It would be well enough for the enquiring consumer to use Amazon's "Search Inside" feature and compare this translation by Mirabai Starr with the other Interior Castle translation by E. Allison Peers. Based on the prose alone, the Peers translation is far superior (and includes translation footnotes to explain where a word is difficult to translate). But the Starr translation fails much more miserably on account that an obvious liberal/"progressive" agenda is involved, wherein words like "sin" and "evil" are changed to be more suitable to contemporary sensibilities. Even "Our Lord" is changed into "Beloved." In other words, the translation wants to change this great Catholic mystical work into something more along the lines of New Age or Neopaganism. This is completely unacceptable and a misrepresentation of St. Teresa. Another reviewer who accidently posted his comments on the Peers translation page had this to say about Starr's translation (I disagree, however, that her translation is "lovely"...it's dumbed-down prose, in my opinion):  Mirabai Starr, the translator of this work, describes herself as a "Hindu/Buddhist/Jew translating the Catholic saints". Her translation is lovely, but quite different from the original, as she substitutes St. Theresa's own words with some that are perhaps more "universal". Below are Ms. Starr's own words: "I opted to minimize references to the inherent wickedness of human beings and replace such terms as "sin" and "evil" with "missing the mark," "imperfection," "unconsciousness," "limitations," and "negativity." "Mortal sin" is "grave error." I call "hell" "the underworld" and the "devil" the "spirit of evil". When I name the "three divine Persons" in the seventh dwelling is what Teresa refers to as the "Holy Trinity."   As I said, the translation is quite lovely, but when St. Teresa said "sin" she did not mean "limitation" or "negativity". She meant sin. This translation is useless to me 
 DON'T BE FOOLED!!!!  The page states that David Lynch directed this, but he actually took his name off (look at the screen shot).  This extended edition was directed by Alan Smithee.  Don't worry though . . . it gets worse.  I don't normally write reviews, but I feel compelled to in this case, so here it goes.  First off, I loved the books and David Lynch's interpretation in the theatrical release.    That being said, this is just aweful.  I totally agree with those who have stated that this is an abomination.  Cons include, but are not limited to:  Good scenes cut from the theatrical Bad voice over with storyboards for much of the 'extra footage' Uneven quality and clumsy transitions to new material The list goes on.  Do yourself a favor and don't spend the money on this.  Just get the theatrical release and be happy.  If you didn't like David Lynch's interpretation, then just take the time and pleasure to read the book again.  I can't believe they actually released this.  I totally understand David Lynch taking his name off of this.  -Sincerely, - 
 Unlike "How to play in traffic" or "how to play with your food"  this book is neither funny nor a Penn & Teller book.  It is what it claims to be on the cover, a book about cheating at cards.    The book starts out with an introduction by Penn Jillette who basically apologizes for putting his name on this book.  Penn tells how he owes the real author ( who's given the nom de plum Dickie Richard )  an enormous favor for helping Penn get started in his career.  The terms of this favor repayment were that Penn put his name on this book so people buy.  It worked at least once because I bought the book thinking it was something it is not.  The BOOK IS ABOUT CHEATING AT CARDS.  Not magic, not humor, not funny anecdotes or tricks ;  cheating at cards.  It is not written be Penn or Teller and has nothing to do with either of them.   
 About 8 months ago, during a very bad "flu-experience", I had a great afternoon reading all the negative reviews on 'The Alchemist' and this little gem. And although I was warned, I just HAD to find out for myself (some stubborn people just never learn, do they): could this book really be as awful as these reviewers said it is? And the answer is YES.   The story is utterly predictable and boring. The characters and plotline are as thin as the paper this book is printed on. As a writer, Coelho totally lacks a sense of humour.   To top it all, Coelho has added a few 'exercises', to help the reader with his/her own spiritual development. Perhaps the most stupid one of them all was to pour some water on a non-water-absorbing flat surface (e.g. a table top), and to dabble about with your fingers in this self-created puddle. I can't even remember what Coelho claimed the effect would be, but it would be a very deep, spiritual and revealing experience. If this appeals to you, please buy as many of his books as you like. You will probably love them. If, like me, just the thought of doing this silly exercise makes you laugh (or cry, depending on your mood), please stay away from this author. His books are just as deep and spiritual and revealing as this puddle.      
 I bought this recording with high hopes.  What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?  Well, not with this recording.  The cast is made up of "distinguished actors," the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line.  The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!  When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  For audio recordings, you need the best voices.  Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this.  My advice?  Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums 
 We ordered this DVD for our son after borrowing the same version on VHS from a friend.  My son loved the "Night Train" song so much that we ordered this DVD for the song alone.  However, the "Night Train" is not on the DVD version, which makes absolutely no sense that the DVD and VHS versions would not contain the same stories (and the "Night Train" was listed as the last story on the VHS).  We now have endless requests for the song and will now have to order the VHS.  This DVD was a ripoff.  Just order the VHS and save your money 
 I had the same experience with this as I did with one of Rettenmund's other books (Blind Items).  Several friends recommended it, it seemed like a good and fun topic, and yet I could not make it past chapter 4.  Rettenmund's writing style reminds me of the articles you read in the Sunday magazine section of your newspaper: The articles go on for pages and pages to say something that could be said in two paragraphs.  If you like this writing style, Rettenmund's books may be for you.  Personally it drove me crazy 
 This book gives a pretty solid overview of Japanese History in a brief manner. I felt it concentrated a little heavily in some areas. For example they went on and on about the Tale of the Genji then wizzed through the Modern Japan section. They also made a harsh criticism of Saint Nichiren but on the other hand they hero worshipped Hideoshi. Despite the fact one was responsible for Buddhist reform and the other for killing as many people as possible in battle. So I thought some areas may have been quite biased according to their own favorite characters in Japanese History. You could do better than to buy this particular book 
 I paid what I would call a fairly high price for a blanket I could have gotten from a Discount club for half the price.  The photo is very misleading in that only the top and bottom edges are hemmed, the left/right sides are simply cut.  I expect this to disolve within 4 washes.  Will not buy from this manufacturer again 
 ABC-CLIO STEALS FROM THEIR AUTHORS, PAYS THEM NOTHING, AND ROBS THEM BLIND. DO NOT PURCHASE BOOKS FROM THEM OR FROM THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. BOYCOTT THESE THIEVES!! 
 I wore these slippers for about one week.  One morning while wearing them, my right foot felt like the material inside the shoe was twisted.  I looked down at the shoe to see what the problem was, and much to my surprise, part of my foot was hanging out the side of the slipper!  The seam had split where the top and side were stitched together.  Very disappointed 
  Kwok is on fire in this movie with maybe his best physical performance ever. He looks like a pop star but his acting is actually very good. Unfortunately, his performance is completely wasted in a movie this bad. I won't explain the story, it is cops vs. drug dealers. There is a beautiful fighting female, good car chases, big name stars, and good fights. How did this movie go wrong? Well, Stanley Tong is a decent director, but he is a stuntman, screen fighter, and martial arts choreographer at heart. He tries to make this an American movie but he disregards everything that gives feeling to movies. I cracked a smile more than a few times but this is the most mindless modern day film I have seen in a long time. Usually, I am able to get past all of this since I am a sucker for good fight scenes, and this movie does have a few. Highlights to watch for are Ken Lo vs. Marc Dacoscos and Dacoscos vs. everyone in the final fight. The thing that ruins this movie is that the real final fight never finishes, but instead it moves on to a totally ridiculous fight to finish off the movie. 'Cradle to the Grave' has a better end fight! Stanley Tong must have been out of his mind because in the finale, Coolio ends up as the main opponent. Not Ken Lo who is the leg fighter that faces Jackie Chan at the end of 'Drunken Master 2', and not Marc Dacoscos who is one of the very best modern day martial arts actors, but Coolio.   I honestly thought this was a good cheesy movie, but the final fight sequence is just horrible. Stanley Tong comes up with a great idea having the actors fighting on a huge piece of glass hundreds of feet in the air and they have to keep their balance while they fight. It is just too bad Coolio had to ruin it. 2.5/5   DVD from Dimension Home Video has good sound and picture quality. No special features except the outtakes in the credits which was a much more satisfying end to the movie. 
 there are a lot of negative comments I've read on silver, and the more I see of her works, the more I understand them.  This isn't real occultism.  I'm sure these spells work well enough, but if that's all anyone practicing this stuff cares about, then you're not really a witch, just some meddler in the arts who dosen't really understand any of this.  Silver's books can be good up to a point, but there are those of us (occultists) who have studied many, many long, extremly painful years in the sacred energies, and these spells can be dangerous.  They're real, and they're dabbling in the energies without really knowing what you're doing.  Silver dosen't take the thought or time to explain true occultism in her books, but I don't think that's really her fault.  Sometimes, I actually think she believes she's a real witch, and I'm sure her "followers" do to.  Take my advice, if you really want to practice magick, then read something else.  DON'T STOP READING THESE BOOKS, if you don't want to, but you do need to read other books by other authors to get many veiws on occultism anyway, so I suggest reading some books by ALEISTER CROWLEY, or some sort of well-known, famous occultist, and see if you don't change your mind about Silver.  If you don't, that's fine, at least you've looked around a little bit more, and if you do, that's good too (you probably will) 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 With all respect due to perhaps the greatest pistoleer the world has ever known, McGivern's book is long on promises and short on tutelage. Somewhere between the author's hyperbole and self-aggrandizing speech, I looked for a tidbit or two of useful, instructional information but found none. In short, McGivern comes across as a blowhard, one who has nothing to offer the reader in terms of advice on shooting. Skip this book---your time would be better spent on the shooting range 
 The Ab Roller was a big disappointment for me. It was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts. Then , once that project was done, I was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me. As a very petite(4'11")woman  my hands barely reached the top bar, making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly. So beware shorties out there 
 this book is full of useless ideas, good ideas, yes, but common sense...not worth the money.. 
 While the information Ms. Drescher gives on her symptoms and warning signs are eye-openers, the book itself is a disappointing waste of paper. Her whining and pettiness has turned what was once a devoted fan of hers to someone who is so glad I don't have to live with someone so selfish and self-absorbed in my life. Wish I could get my money back from Ms. Drescher, no wonder she's not on TV anymore 
 Any book with the title "World Encyclopedia of Horse Racing" that doesn't even mention Harness Racing and Quarter Horse racing is not worthy of the title.  Give this one a pass; at only 2oo+ pages it's just not all that-- and any author who dares to claim that this is as comprehensive as the title implies  and then produces this cannot really know much about the sport 
 that was the worst novel ever.  I didn't follow the story line at all.  It seemed so random, almost like there wasn't a story line at all.  I was soooo confused with the book because I didn't see any characters except some hydrogen, cobalt, and zinc oxide.  There were so many marraiges between hydrogen and carbons and other oddly named people.  I was revolted when reading that 2 hydrogens married an oxygen.  DO NOT GET THIS BOOK.  IT IS POSSIBLY THE WORST STORY I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO READ 
 Gay Talese's work on his family's journey from Italy to America is an involved tale that delves into a difficult historical period for both the United States and Italy.  Revolution, social upheaval, racism, and war  color Talese's story from start to finish.  These themes give the tale a  characteristically depressing bent which tends to ramble in certain places.   In addition, there is a decided social message which the author appears to  be trying to put forth during the entire story.  These perspectives, and  those on Italian history, should be viewed in the context of  interpretations of an Italian American writer and not be taken as those of  traditional native Italian scholars.  Still, the book is in a bold attempt  at telling the story of one family's struggle, on both sides of the  Atlantic, during the social upheaval of the twentieth century 
 Oh, I forgot.... everyone in ancient Israel spoke with an English accent. That's right. This movie is just plain uninteresting. To begin with, an entirely different actor plays David for the first 30 minutes of this movie. He's supposed to be the young David but when Richard Gere finally appears as David, they look absolutely nothing alike. The story just wonders. It doesn't seem very well directed and I found it very hard to stay interested. Get "David: The Bible Collection" dvd. It is much, much, better. 
 Probably the most creative part of this book is it's title and jacket. This is not a mystery story, and the search for the lady in the paintings is just a minor journey, interspersed with dozens of peripheral characters that come and go in a flash. Some funny moments halfway through the book in events that probably didn't really happen (his grandmother getting sucked up a garbage chute into the kitchen from the basement during a tornado)are much welcome after his meandering into unrelated asides from classical literature. It's a short book that should have been much shorter 
  My three favorite films from 2004, "Sideways", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", and "Before Sunset" have a lot in common; they all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances.   There are more similarities in three my favorite films - they all have characters I liked, I care about; often, weak and certainly not perfect; sometimes, confused and immature but sympathetic, and real.   This is not the case with "Closer". My problem is that none of its four main characters was at least slightly interesting, appealing, likable or just realistic. And it is not the biggest problem that they were not likable - I can live with that and still love and enjoy the film. Examples - Nichols's own fascinating debut, "Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf". George and Martha (Liz Taylor and Richard Burton) were a couple from hell but like a theme song in "Closer" goes, "I could not take my eyes off them". I still remember Taylor saying in the end of the film, "George and Martha: Sad, sad, sad" and it was sad. I'd learned something about the characters that were deep and complex, troubled and disturbed. They were persons, the human beings, not the caricatures. Another example, Ingmar Bergman's "Scenes from the marriage":  "Bergman and his leading actors Liv Ullmann and Arland Josephson give one of the most truthful, honest, heartbreaking and credible portraits of a couple, one of the most intense character studies ever done on film. For five hours, we share twenty years from the lives of Johan and Marianne as well as their love, hate, misunderstandings, insecurities, anger, jealousy, denial, sadness, pain, despair, and loss. We witness the moments of incredible tenderness and unexpected and shocking violence, both physical and mental. There are no depth that they have not descended in the search of themselves and the meaning of their relationship."  As far as a film about the selfish, self-obsessed, unsympathetic characters goes, "Faithless", directed by Liv Ullmann and written by Ingmar Bergman could be the most similar in its theme to "Closer" and they both have almost identical twist plot toward the end. The difference is huge, though. "Faithless" has a high and unbearable tragedy that characters brought upon themselves, "Closer" is smug, full of itself and tries to hide its emptiness behind often disgusting and unnecessary dirty language. Did I learn something about four beautiful people in "Closer"? Sure. Dan's sperm tastes like Larry's but sweeter; Alice's c*** tastes like heaven, and Anna does not kiss strange men and does not understand why sex is so important. I don't want to get closer to learn all this; instead, I'd like to respond like Helen Sinclair, "No, no, don't speak. Don't speak. Please don't speak. Please don't speak. No. No. No. Go. Go... Don't speak."  Enormously talented and famous (and rightly so) Mike Nichols made an elegantly looking, well acted (Natalie Portman and Clive Owen are very good) and quite amusing film which is a screen adaptation of a popular play of the same title. Popular or not, the play was not a great work of writing and its problems are very obvious after adaptation to the big screen.   2.5/5  
 I third that emotion.  Also, it's a strange collection, neither focusing explicitly on "hits" and singles, nor on the concert staples, just a mish mash.  All great excellent songs, but no need for this cd.  
 What a terrible biography!  Leon Wagener's book is full of inaccuracies, is based upon "interviews" conducted with those tied to Armstrong that many of the interviewees claim never occurred, and is yet another shameful example of a writer with marginal talent propagating the same tired, FALSE urban legends about the first man on the Moon that have been circulating for decades.  I look forward to the day when Mr. Armstrong will allow a true writer to accurately and justly tell his remarkable story.  Leon Wagoner should stick to his day job as a writer for Star Magazine!   
 This book broke my heart. I read it, hoping to learn some more encouraging postivie ways of coping with my mother's cancer. Instead, I was subjected to an ideology that believes dying of cancer is the patients fault. Bernie, as he likes to be called, believes that patients are able to heal themselves if only they "love" enough. And if they don't, they die - regardless of treatment. Bernie also surmises that cancer is brought on by patients and their emotional states. That is outrageous! My mother, who is dying of cancer, has nothing but love to give and has been loving, kind and supportive all her life. I would love for Bernie to tell me what exactly he thinks my mother did to give her cancer and cause her to undergo the dying process??    I'm disgusted that he wrote this garbage and passes it on as a legitimate source for coping with terminal illness. 
 Just like the old Chariots of Gods, his books are very interesting and and entertaining.  But please dont think that you are reading a scientific work.  Real historical works are not as sexy and entertaining as these books just as real archeologists are not Indiana Joneses.  
 This could have been a riveting tale...the problem is the story has no depth whatsoever. I would even say it is badly written. We dont get any insight as to what Jamie found lacking in his marraige. We read about Jamie's dreams' being shattered ....but what wexactly were those dreams? to be a race car driver? And how did having a family stifle him? these issues are never explored.    And when he decides to go back to his family, what made him do that. A pep talk from his friend? Guilt? I wish the story had delved more into what happens to the husband and wife when they get back together and how they decide to rebuild their shattered lives. The story was very sketchy and it simply didnt delve into different emotions. There was more time spent on commuting details than the actual affair. And after all that, it seemed like Jamie went back to his wife more out a sense of duty than because he loved her.  The final straw is that the lead characters are totally unlikeable. Jamie acts like a total jerk and seemed to be more considerate towards his mistresses' feelings than his wife's.  And Teri seems to relish the affair with no thought to the consequences of what they were doing including throwing her best friend out.  I hope Matthews doesnt write a sequel to this story...the heroine is totally unsympathetic and I doubt if many readers will identify with her 
 This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.  I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else...  How this book ever got a top review is beyond me.  Please do not waist your tim 
 The picture makes the exterior 'look' like it is suede-esk, but it's actually a cheap thin mixture between fabric and plastic.  The heat barely radiates through and only when the cat is inside (although the bottom of unit is always toasty).    The cord is the best feature.  Very sturdy and assuring.  Would not suggest this product.  Over priced 
 Plain and simple, there is no such thing as the group, Earth, Wind & Fire without Maurice White.  Anything else is simply not genuine EWF, and true fans of their music know this 
 I took this guide to Oaxaca to carry in the field, as the Howell guide is so heavy.  I almost threw it over the cliff at Monte Alban.  It will help you remember which euphonia is which, but for anything more subtly marked it is almost no help at all.  Furthermore, there are no range maps, no details on alternate plumages, little to no information on vocalizations.  I would have done better to bring the old Peterson guide, even though it is out of date 
 While I thought that Ms. Warner's points were accurate, she spends the entire book going over and over the same points until one is simply tired of hearing about the problem with no idea how to escape it. I agree that many of today's famalies are over-scheduled and spending way too much time at daily multiple activities rather than living. This book points out a problem but does nothing to suggest how to combat it.   One quote from the book I found offensive was on pg. 25, "I had no qualms about eliminating those activities I found needlessly boring or stupid-like the lap-sit story hour at the nearby American Library..." As a children's librarian I guess I took this harder than others would. I agree that many activities could and should be scaled back and or cut, but perhaps Ms. Warner fails to understand that story hour is an effort to teach parents how to share books at home with kids. Of all the things to cut it is my hope people will opt out of soccer for a 3 year old and take a trip to the library once in a while. 
 Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey  
 While I'm sure the stories are great, I can't get past the poor type setting, and cheap paper which is practically newsprint. The words and illustrations bleed through from the next page making reading very difficult. And to make matters worse, the stories are set in a terrible, hard to read font and tight leading. This book is NOT kid-friendly at all. YUCK! Same is true of the Hans Christian Andersen Fairy Tales by same Author/Publisher 
 I have to agree that the DVD is not of very good quality. Movement is indeed blurred. This is, in fact, the only ballet disk which I have where I have noticed this to such an extent.  ABT telecasts of such ballets as Swan Lake or Le Corsair on DVD are much superior in terms of the quality of the disk.  I found it coninually interfered with my enjoyment of the dance.  One other complaint-- sometimes exits are as exciting as anything else in the dance.  No one who ever saw Edward Villela will ever forget his whirling off the stage after the 'playing tag' section of Rubies.  On this DVD, the camera cuts away before the dancer's exit!   
 I will not give "Candyman 3: Day of the Dead" a serious analysis because it is so stupid and to be frank, is not even worthy of a review other than to say that this TRASH sucks just like the rest of the series, but also, this movie goes above beyond being horrible and is the epitome of the word "lame".  THIS MOVIE "F"ing SUCKS!!!  Please pardon me for my language, but after watching this movie, I am sure you can understand my distress after wasting my time on this complete and utter rubbish 
 In my opinion this book jumps around way too much and is a little confusing.  It has dialogue for a couple of people, then another couple of people, and then another.  I suggest you take notes to keep up with who everyone is and what is going on 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 I was pleased to see this book at our local bookstore, but decided to check it out of our library first. Boy, am I glad I did! Many of the recipes include Worcestershire sauce. Students, especially those who are new to vegetarianism, may simply trust this book and may not know that Worcestershire sauce contains anchovies -- meat! Also, some canned mushroom soups have a beef base, which the author also neglects to mention. Just a note at the start -- or even just a concerted effort to specify *vegetarian*  Worcestershire sauce would have made all the difference. However, these flaws are so big as to keep me from purchasing this book -- for myself, for any friends, or for the collection of the library in which I work 
 I had to say that I, too, thought this was the worst book I have ever read--hands down.  I have a master's degree in comparitive literature, and other than Moll Flanders and Fanny Hill, I have never read a...what did the other reviewer call them "bodice-rippers"?--so it's not a case of lack of taste.  The author of this book is self-indulgent, pompous, "in the know, and I'm never going to let you forget it!"--the whole thing is like listening to a half muttered conversation that after time you realize that you are never going to be let into.  I did plow through to the end, but only as a test of my endurance.  And I cheered at the end--but only because the damned thing was done 
 These guys used to be good, especially during the "Glory to the Brave" and "Legacy of Kings" days. The only track I somewhat liked on this was Blood Bound, I know this band is better than this 
 Picked it up at Tower the other day ($9.99),because I like the DMB and now I see you can pick it up at Amazon for a $1.36.  At that cheap of a price,that should pretty much clue you in that something was up.  Not a very good outing(bad production).  Murky.fuzzy.lacking in general fidelity.  It sounds as if it were dubbed to death.  Were these guys even together in the same recording studio ?  DMB is a "jam" band, and this album just sounds as if that magical element is missing.  When I listen to other DMB albums,it sounds(and feels)like everybody is having a good time.  Kind of wooden and by the numbers on this one.  When DMB is on ,they are as good as it gets,but when they are off...  I wanted to pick up the newer DMB,but since Sony pulled the DRM incident,that album will not be on my playlist ANYTIME soon 
 It seems to me like somehow Hollywood manages to glorify nearly every Abberant Human Condition such as Alcoholism (Barfly, Cocktail), Drug Abuse (Blow) and a host of other subjects. This movie glorifies Adultery as Alan Alda and Ellen Who Is Not Burstin' With Anything spend one weekend a year having sex with each other. One has to begin to wonder just how much these two need each other as they seem to manage quite well apart for the other 363 days of the year. This is a  pitiful and very tedious and sad excuse for a movi 
 This volume is a book about something.  But its not about Robert Johnson, its not about escaping the Delta, and its hardly about the blues.  It is more a rambling chronology of popular music, and the ways in which Blues is nested into that overall context.  It is as much or more about musicians other than blues musicians.  And when it focuses on "blues musicians", it goes to great and repeated lengths to demonstrate they were not really "Blues" musicians at all.  We understand them to be such today, the author labors, because Blues sold.  In fact, the author repeats, the "Blues" musicians we have come to revere liked to play, and did play, other kinds of music as much or more than blues, including ragtime, tin pan alley, fife and drum and spirituals.  See?  They weren't really blues players at all.  They were versatile musicians forced into this genre by the music business, many of them preferring to play something other than blues.  Huh.  Further, the author posits that latter day (white?) blues musicians are not really playing the blues either.  They are acting "as if", affecting musical styles and inflections that are not their own.  Sort of make believe blues performing.  Imitating the blues musicians of yore, and not authentically expressing themselves in their own right.  Despite Fred McDowell's and John Lee Hooker's assertion that "the Blues is a feeling", the author would apparently have us believe that it was only THEIR feeling, not one available to others.  Suffice it to say, the author and I do not share a fundamental view of what the Blues is.  Would I buy, read, or reccommend this book.  No, no and no.  It isn't what it says it is.  And what it is is superficial in its depth of understanding of Blues expression, and how and where that happens

 I can't begin to state how disappointing this book was to me; as a student of the early Republic, I enjoy reading a great deal of authorship concerning the Constitution and its aftereffects, much of which continues to ripple forward in our modern age.  There are so many infinitely superior works available to readers today, some of which have been previously mentioned, but also include:  Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton Stanley Elkins/Eric McKitrick The Age of Federalism : The Early American Republic, 1788-1800 Willard Sterne Randall's Alexander Hamilton: A Life The Federalist Papers Darren Staloff's Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson : The Politics of Enlightenment and the American Founding Lance Banning's The Sacred Fire of Liberty: James Madison and the Founding of the Federal Republic  ...and many more.  The author's constant use of the word "blunder" only demonstrates his inability to write prose that is based on cogent arguments - rather, he opts to conduct mere rants and obviously demonstrates his simplistic, Jeffersonian bias in historical interpretation.  Normally I would refrain from getting too personal, but the only thing I can say about this book is that I now have something with which to line my birdcage.  Stay away from this "term paper" of a book and spend your money and time exploring the aforementioned books if you really want to  gain real insight into the events of the early Republic.

 First of all, almost half the material in this book is right out of Paul Fussell's "Class..." and the author even quotes straight out of this book. I hope he got a nice chunk from the sales!   I recommend MOST of the advice given in this book to novices who are of the working class or those who have never read Paul Fussell's book. However, being someone who has lived around old moneyed folks most of my life, I can tell you there are some advices in this book that is just wrong. For example: Cartier tank watchs are a must for old money, capri pants and anything shiny is out and cufflinks are pretentious. All wrong. In Palm Beach, capris are on every woman out for a casual walk, shopping, etc. especially in that shiny silk material most quality neckties are made of. Cartiers are definitely nouveau, whynot recommend a Rolex! Lastly, cufflinks on Frech shirts are worn by most preppies turned attorney/banker in New York - not everyone can pull this off, ONLY those gents who gone to the right schools and belong to the right clubs and speak properly.  This is a cute book, nice attempt and has some sage advice. HOwever, take the advice in this book with a grain of salt. Please note the author did not grow up among the upper class, she just dated someone who was and read Paul Fussell's book.      
 Yet another disappointment.  This is not suited to self-study, very few exercises and no answers!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK! 
 This text displays a plethora of simplistic, presumptuous and shallow typologies purporting to explain what is a leader and why it has to be so. Without any concern for contemporary social studies the author tells us  about what inborn qualities signifies a female leader, why there are fewer  black leaders than white ones ("scientifically proven" low  cognitive ability according to the author, pp. 740-741), and the litany  goes on. It is baffling that this stuff is still available in the book  market as anything else than obscure reminiscences of American social  science in a time we rather forget about 
 While this book deserves some place in history for being an early work of American fiction and it's rich descriptions of early American geography, it is intensely hard to enjoy. The basic plotline is interesting, but the execution and character development is just plain awful. At many points in the book, Cooper just glosses over action leaving a confused reader wondering just what the hell happened and how. The real killer though is the character development. The unidimensional and shallow characters are stereotypes at best, and the women in the novel are written so thin they practically disappear. One might think that Cooper had never actually met a woman before given his portrayal. The book does have points to recommend it from a historical or geographical basis, but if anyone is actually looking for a good book to read, look elsewhere 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player.  When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries.  Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's "memory effect" or "voltage depression," my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.    If you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much "juice" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit 
 Despite its promising title, this book is a bust.  It has no real unity.  It is poorly written, and poorly organized.  And the ideas are just so-so.  I got it on sale and was sorry, even so, to have spent the money.   Update: 12/14/05--Lakeland's positive review is obviously a mistake, since it is about another book (by Cuzzins) 
 I regret having purchased this product.  I have not been able to use it for two months, after finally giving up trying to get it to work.  I have a very nice laptop running Windows XP Home, and encountered many problems.  I tried all of the avenues available to me through QuickBooks, online, via email, and on the telephone.  I spent nearly 25 hours overall trying to get the numerous issues taken care of.  Here are just a few:  The program would not convert my Quicken data; random script errors when you try to access help topics within the product; the phone # provided in the payroll demo is invalid; None of my info was viewable after bank download - it spontaneously failed to download my bank account info, after having successfully downloaded it for about two weeks.  I spent 2 & 1/2 hours on the phone trying to resolve just this one issue.  Part of the problem lies in the fact that I was unable to speak to a customer service person who's first language was English.  Each time I was on the phone, the customer service person seemed to continually ask me to re-describe the problem, then he/she would seem to be typing the info into the computer and waiting....then eventually telling me some solution to try, then eventually telling me they did not know what the problem was.  Not helpful in any way, though very polite. I'm sorry to say that this is a terribly designed, convoluted, over-complicated, non-user-friendly item which I would like to toss over a cliff.  
 I read this book while studying both contemporary North American and cross-cultural weddings and marriages.  Ingrahms book describes the "white wedding" a white upperclass affair as discriminatory and exclusive.  She focuses on the institution of marriage being perpetuated by old white folk and major corporations.  Unfortunatley she does not expand into the universality of marriage.  I do not recomend this book.  It is narrow and inconclusive 
 I own a ton of workout dvd's and thought I might try this one due to the ten minute interval toning sections. I like to use these as add-ons to my cardio vids.  However, I tried the entire video twice and could not get over the instructor... her chatter was really annoying and I felt like she was teaching a kindergarten class.  I am not easily annoyed, and was surprised by my dislike of this dvd... I am definitely selling this one on ebay 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 When this gadget works, it's great. Trouble is, it hardly ever works. And getting it to communicate with the PC is nearly impossible. On top of that, technical support is poor. They reply fast enough. They just don't know enough.  It's a great idea. Just not ready for prime time. Don't buy it. You'll regret it if you do 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 After reading "Why Do Men Have Nipples" and loving it, I had high hopes for book number two.  I really enjoyed all the chapters in book 1, excluding the dialogue between the authors.  I found it boring and irrelevant to the book itself.  I skipped those sections.  The chapter topics were written humorously but gave factual information. Very fun and interesting!  This book, was boring.  The chapter topics are not nearly as interesting as the first book's.  Once again there is the annoying dialogue (which I skipped).  There was virtually no humor in this book. I felt like the authors scraped the barrel to come up with topics this time around. I was VERY disappointed in this book. I read it in a couple hours. Zzzzz.  Guess these authors are good for just one time 
 What can I say, this book lacked all the details I wanted to read, and was pretty darn predictable to boot. I could tell that it was written by a foreigner because it never contained any "advanced" vocabulary. Always just kept mentioning the same food and the same feelings and the same blah blah blah...Enough. I'm done with this thing 
 This book has glaring errors in the chapter regarding Dr. Gary Kildall and CP/M.  The author trashes DOS as a "slapdash clone" and a "rip-off" of CP/M, which is simply untrue.  Tim Paterson, the author of DOS, is in fact suing the publisher and the author over numerous misrepresentations in the book.  Save your money and get a book that is better researched 
 I have a corded USB wireless antenna from Linksys that keeps falling off the table, so I thought I'd give this 'great new wireless' card a shot. I got it today and all the things the other reviewers said is happening to me also. It connects and then automatically disconnects. I tried NOT using their driver disc and letting Windows (XP) set it up (like the Linksys one did) and it forces me to use their driver, which won't work. I'm sending it back 
 What a dreary tome. Ms. Professor Williams has a unique ability to obscure the most obvious and trite revelations in pedantic and turgid prose that she thinks is thrillingly poetic because the words are long-winded and flowery. and that's when she's making sense, which isn't very often. the rest of her writings tend to be either outright calls for more preferences for her preferred friends camouflaged as courageous iconoclasm, or just plain idiocy posing as intellectually daring originality. Sadly enough, if Thomas Kuhn is right, we'll have the likes of Professor Pat around for another couple of decades. (But hey, if you have the money, you can always sign up for the Nation's annual cruise and talk about the revolution with Pat and the gang for a mere 8 grand or so.... 
 This book is in DESCRIPTIVE NOTATION, not algebraic notation.  Do not buy this book 
 "All the Tricks... All the Tips" is a VERY far stretch from the truth.  There are literally hundreds of footbag tricks.  This book shows ONLY ONE SINGLE "TRICK" and several basic "KIKCS".  I am a professional footbag player and would say that if you want to learn to play freestyle footbag, that you search elsewhere.  I have personally developed a flyer that shows 4 basic kicks, and 16 tricks.  The one page color Fundemantals Flyer is one page has over 130 pictures illusrtating the moves. I give this flyer out free so that people can learn freestyle.  Lastly, the footbag that comes with this book is ill suited for even basic freestyle tricks.  
 I loved the theatrical/cable release; but the editted/cut "commercial" cable version destroyed the emotional impact of the theatrical release of the movie.  We bought the "directors cut" hoping to recapture the movie.  What a major disappointment.  Don't waste your money.  They dropped the whole "I got hammered" sequence and replaced Kris (and his son Johnny) with vocals by hot lips Sally Kellerman.  Way not cool 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 Here you have a contrary view. This was the first book of Morrell's I have attempted to read. It will be the last. Obviously, he is popular. But I found the plot to be labyrinthine, dense, confusing, overpopulated, and after plodding along till about page 170, realizing I knew not what was going on, I threw up my hands 
 More re releases..the only cool thing about this is the cover 
 The author tells us little about John of Gaunt, but a lot about his personal inclinations.  I quick read but with little substance 
 Most of the Voyager books that I've read have been quite good--especially the ones by Christie Golden. She can really write. However, Death of a Neutron Star was anything but exciting. Eric Kotani's writing style was adolescent. Despite what others may say, I felt like I was reading a story that I might have written in sixth grade! The characters were not developed, though they blandly followed their early series-established outlines. The plot was dull, and every single event could be easily predicted. If you want to read a good STV book, read one by Ms. Golden, but for god's sake, don't spend a penny on this peice of junk 
 I have had this straightener for about a year.  It will get my wavy hair straight but not quickly and I have to use the high heat settings.  Also, my hair does not get stick straight but if your hair is already pretty straight then this is a good straightener 
 While this book does appear to have a good coverage of topics, there is little to be found here that wouldn't be considered trivial by anyone who has completed a math course at the junior high level 
 This supposedly radical tale of adolescence, shallow political conviction, lesbianism and prostitution was a letdown.  Tea's prose reminds me of those girls who will natter incessantly to anyone who will listen about their  self-inflicted degradation with all the gory details but not a point to be  found.  Lacking introspection and only rarely showing flashes of wit, this  one's a simplistic catalog of truly sad events.  It is not helped by its  affected prose style, featuring teen-girly exclamations, run-ons, and  erratic capitalization.  This is beneath Tea, who doesn't seem willing to  write at her obviously high intelligence level.  She does a great  disservice to this material, which could have been incisive literature  rather than the forgettable trash it is 
 Pros: -Exercises are well described and illustrated with caveats to avoid and variations. -A well organized plan for exercising.  Cons: -Lots of editing mistakes -Using almost the same exercises over and over seems boring and counter productive -The book recommends you to limit your exercies to one hour yet the workout routines at a minimum contains 14 exercises of 2 sets each even for the beginner. With one minute rest between each exercise and one minute for performing the exercise and moving/changing plates/waiting for the rack to empty/etc at the very minimum that's already an hour (especially that exercises are superset so you will be doing a lot of moving around). Add warmup set to that and you've got a lot more than you anticipated. -Selection of exercises do not mention which exercises targets which muscles (i.e. only chest/back/shoulders). I would prefer mentioning what parts of the delts or which part of the chest. -Follows from the previous point also the author says "You can replace with another exercise .." but doesn't tell you which exercise can be replaced with which. We know that not all chest exercise are created equal. Not enough information on that. -No mention of warmup. For example in the breakin routine which is supposedly for beginners, the book specifies 2 sets of 10 for most exercises. Now I can't imagine going straight ahead to the gym doing 2 sets of each exercise with a heavy weight that only allows 10 reps. Definitely that's the shortest way to injury and soreness. Also as you do the first set of 10 without prior warmup , the second set will be easier and you can increase the weight. So is that the goal? just doing 10 reps of whatever you can? not enough on that. -No mention of stretches prior or after workout. And given that warmup is not mentioned either, it seems it was just neglected rather than being intentionally designed out of the program. -The book website forums are almost ignored, no questions answered any recently, and sending email to the author doesn't seem to make any replies back 
 I was looking for help with my relationship addiction.  This book is so stuffed with mumbo jumbo I couldn't get through the first chapter.  
 It starts out very well by going into the action and it is well written until you get to the center of the novel.  At that time I felt that I needed a college degree to get thru the rest of it.  The book goes into a metaphysical, scientifical, and all other ifical reasons and explanations for the origin of heroes.  Not what I thought when I saw it.  i read one other Justice League novel and it was almost the same way.  This has turned me off to this type of novel.  Use your money to go and get a comic book,  it is better in my opinion.  Welty6 
 It seems I'm the minority here, but I believe this was one of the worst books I have ever read. Maybe it's only because I have no interest in politics what so ever, or that I was forced to read it for school. But in my opinion "Profiles in Courage" was so incredibly boring, it's not even funny. It wasn't well written or even very informative at all. It would mention political events, but not go in to any detail, so you must have a lot of prior knowledge to understand what's going on. Honestly, these senators seemed to be more stubborn than courageous. And I really don't care how dome shaped Daniel Webster's head was 
 This is a weird book, written for an unclear audience.  Its apparent audience is people who want to get off roads on their own power but have no clue how to do this.   To help them, it has a chapter on "seeking challenges" that discusses rock climbing, mountain biking, river rafting, and other activities.  Oddly this comes *after* chapters on "planning a trip" and "getting equipped."  That's odd because I'd have thought that you would need to choose the activity before selecting equipment, but apparently that's not necessary.  The bulk of the book discusses 18 back country destinations in the US and Canada, about half of which are national parks.  The rest consist of national forests, state parks, and other kinds of units.   These range from the familiar (the Smokies) to the less familiar (Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas and Oklahoma).  These destinations aren't organized in any useful way around activities.  For example, the chapter on Monogahela National Forest emphasizes mountain biking, but that's not obvious from the title of the chapter or from the organization.  As a result, you have to read or skim everything to find anything.  The chapters also lack enough information to do anything.  For example, the chapter on Theodore Roosevelt National Park discusses a series of day hikes and weekend backpacks, none of which gets more than a paragraph.  That's not enough information to choose among the options, much less plan a trip. 		 The real strength of the book is the photographs, and these are great.  But you can find great photographs of the outdoors in many other books. 
 Guess what the biggest sin is according to C.S. Lewis in his  self-aggrandizing book, Mere Christianity?  No, silly, not murder, child molestation, starting wars, or rape. It's PRIDE.  Oh yes, and here is another chunk of wisdom for those who find deep meaning in blather: "Thinking about doing something is the same as doing it." (Don't let those thinking about hurting you find this out.)  Frankly, I'd rather someone think about molesting my kid than actually doing it. Plus, C.S. Lewis tells us that soldiers should kill for their country with a lightness of heart. Plus, we should love everyone the same--spouse, kids, god, mailmen, assassins, C.S. Lewis, Darwin, etc. C.S. Lewis offers nuggets of so-called truths without providing a smattering of evidence in support of his supernatural notions. You know, god, soul, virgin births, evil, hell, etc.--all the good stuff that keeps you blindly faithful while giving the logic cells in your brain a rest.  Are you tired of trying to convince yourself that your pastor speaks the truth? Let this book convince you the way no amount of evidence can.  If you prefer actual truth, try Carl Sagan's more contemporary work, The Demon Haunted World, or pull up the short essay by Richard Dawkins called Good and Bad Reasons for Believing.  Leave this book to the astrology crowd and those who think aliens visit earth to make goofy designs in cornfields; if truth is your passion, science is your source.It evolves.  If you like to believe stuff based on conjecture, testimony, anecdote, fear of reprisal, and because it just makes you feel good, check out the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, anything by Shirley McLaine; try dianetics, the Torah, assorted versions of the old and new testament; don't forget the book of Mormon, and Reverend Moon has some persuasive nuggets too.  I'm sure there are lots of prophets, gods, and gurus who would gladly tell you just exactly what it all means.  
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 The publisher limits how many pages can be printed. If you want to print say, two chapters, to take on the plane for reading, you can't print that many pages 
 Forty years ago Hogan's Heroes worked because it was pure farce and its German POW camp was acceptable as a setting for a comedy, while Life Is Beautiful failed in large part because a German concentration camp is not a place to set humor. I was told this was a charming movie with a lot of joy within it. "Joy despite the misery," is what someone said. I found it ridiculous, boring, and an insult to the memory of those who were murdered by the Third Reich. Roberto Benigni wasn't funny, just manically irritating. The actor needs either animal tranquilizers or a punch in the mouth, I'm not sure which. Maybe both. Life Is Beautiful was a horrible film that shocked me with its idiocy, far-fetched plot turns, and overall annoying awfulness start to finish. How filmgoers ever fell for this incredibly unfunny waste of time baffles me 
 I expected this book to be more of a training manual of techniques. Instead, every page is a photo with a VERY brief explanation of how or where it was taken, often without enough detail to recreate the idea. Although the photos are beautiful and Tony Sweet is a great photographer, the book is not at all what I expected. If you're looking for a photo book of his work, it's great, but don't expect to learn much from it 
 Pretty much lots and lots of "soapbox" chat without much actual practical information. Not recommende 
 I rented this movie because I really adore the two lead actors.  However, although they do the best they can, there is no saving this banal, movie of the week-esque movie.  There are a couple of nice moments, most notably when D'Onofrio's character talks about his father and about his love of football.  Other than that, the story seems to be cobbled together from many other "uplifting" movies.  At times, you can not only guess what will happen next, but can guess what the exact line will be.  Football hero becomes self-pitying after an accident leaves him blind (and unable to satisfy his cheap girlfriend in the sack--which she exposes in a tell-all book).  His tutor from school shows up, himself in a wheelchair, and pops this crazy idea to enter a whitewater rafting race.  Even though he professes to have it all together and is all rah-rah, he still feels his own sadness that his dreams of being a dentist were dashed by a drunk driver.  But first--you knew it!--they have to learn to trust each other.  This involves whacky stunts.  The two drive to the race, having adventures, learning about themselves and each other, suprising locals with can-do spirit.  Each scene seems to end with the two sharing a warm laugh in the fuzzy sunset.  Each person they run into is nutty.  And even though I said I liked this, the lines from the scene where Olee talks about his dad seem to practically be directly from "The Breakfast Club" where the jock talks emotionally about his dad.  Only the commitment of Hines and D'Onofrio keep this one from getting no stars at all.  So to recap: Person who's cocky and beloved for his physical prowess loses it and feels sorry for himself? Check. That person has one last chance to hear the chanting of the crowd and relive the glory? Check. Another person who's been down that same road of self-pity and redemption comes along to save him? Check. Two men bond on the road and endure colorful locals? Yup. Student becomes teacher? Yes. Locals try to keep them down? Check. Other dreamers lend a hand? Drunk driving? Boy stunted emotionally by father? Bathroom humor? Improbable competition set up to prove worth of the outsiders, and won to stirring music and cheers? All those who've been touched by the quest and who we've met along the way show up at the end? Suprise ending that is supposed to warm your heart and teach you what's really important?  Yes, yes, yes 
 I thought Bohemia was a country? No wait... it's an eating disorder, right 
 As someone who lived (and, I guess, is still living) the life of a "gifted" person, I'm not terribly surprised by what I found in this book.  Many of the problems held by gifted students originate not from parents but from bureaucrats--people who want to figure out how best to control their talents for profit.  There isn't much profit for the parents themselves, so where's the profit going to come from?  Other than those kids marked by stock brokers and scientists for high-paying jobs, what's left?  Political profit, of course, and this is Quart's real goal.  Quart simply oppresses her topic into non-existence unless it can produce the right kind of person that will be sure to vote the right way.  Scrabble players, spelling bee kids, math geniuses...they're all weird at best and dangerous at worst, *especially* if they've been home-schooled or attend church.  Competitors in chess are hyper-competitive, but (surprisingly?) kids participating in politically-charged poetry slams are "encouraging" and "supportive".  She weeps for school districts that support the gifted and thereby thwart the  "equal results" that certain political groups seek, yet cannot find anything but disdain for programs that support the results of all students  simply (and clearly) because of the political party that happened to begin it.  Her descriptions of her subjects are caricatured so badly that one cannot have any faith in the descriptions.  And, as some have noted below, she has played loose and fast with those she quotes in order to make the right sort of case.  If you have the ability to ignore or refute the author's opinions through basic critical-reading skills, you can get a basic idea of the sorts of issues faced by the gifted.  If not, look elsewhere 
 ~I bought the MVSV3-1m cable and put it between my Pioneer V555 DVD player and SONY WEGA tv KV-27FS12, I was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality, color, sharpness. Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don't know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don't use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don't have a benchmark to evaluate it. 
 Not having read any of Vonnegut's work for 30 years, I opened A Man Without a Country and remembered why I'd SO assiduously avoided him. As a natural conservative I much enjoy the thrust and parry of lively political debate. But KV, like almost every socialist I've ever met, doesn't do debate, preferring mockery, innuendo, myth and wilfully distorted facts. It's the superior sneer of the self-styled intellectual who doesn't know what he's talking about. His unwavering belief in doctrinal socialism brings to mind a line from Emerson: "Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."  His defence of Marx, beginning with religion being the opium rather than the opiate of the masses demonstrates his willingness to distort language. That he then manages to blend the benefits of Marxist ideology with the evils of slavery left me moderately bemused. (The American Indian, who cause he champions, was something of a proto-Marxist and quite happily used slaves.) His obsession with slavery and the inference that the United States was uniquely guilty of it is symptomatic of historical revisionism at its most banal. Slavery is a millennia-old, worldwide phenomenon, with a reasonable chance that most of us have distant ancestors who suffered it. But during the period he's most exercised about villainous white slavers didn't mount raids into the interior of Africa, they purchased stock from coastal chieftains who enjoyed vast profits from the sale of fellow Africans. And who, after parliament made not just the trade but the ownership of slaves illegal in Britain, wrote letters of howling protest to the crown that the new law was going to ruin them. Just as Vonnegut ignores the complicity of Africans in the trade, he also omits that it was white European stock that lobbied against and eventually outlawed what had existed in Africa long before the arrival of the first Portuguese explorers, and continued long after it was banned by European and North American governments (or that it still exists amongst the Arabs and West Africans today). Unsurprisingly, he overlooks the enslavement of over a million white Europeans by Barbary corsairs between 1500 and the mid-1800s. Spain and the Italian city states suffered the greatest depredations, but the North African raiders seized thousands of Irish, Cornish and Welsh and not an insignificant number of colonial American seamen. (See Christian slaves, Muslim Masters, Robert Davis, Palgrave MacMillan, 2003)  Vonnegut decries the "135,000" deaths in the bombing of Dresden, deliberately ignoring that German academics now put the figure at closer to 30,000. Which is bad enough, but ol' Kurt not only prefers the discredited number, but makes no mention of the 60,000 British civilians killed between 1940 and 1945 by German bombs, V1s and V2s.  His horror over the deaths of some 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki doesn't include the 300,000 deaths in Nanking to Japanese bullet, bayonet, gang rape, and burning or burying alive, or the three million Chinese who died during the invasion and occupation of their country by Imperial troops. Or that Allied soldiers, PoWs, and enslaved Asian labourers were dying at the hands of the Japanese right up to the day after that big flash over Nagasaki. Balance is not one of Kurt's strengths.  Comparing Americans with Nazis ("And with good reason.") is simply fatuous. Not even the most virulently anti-Bush liberal leftie hyperventilates at the prospect of the USA invading Luxembourg or Andorra.  "Our president is a Christian?" Kurt asks. "So was Adolf Hitler." In fact, Hitler had the same disdain for religion as Marx had. The future Greater Germany was to be religion-free.  His many references to the evil of oil might have at least a hint of resonance if I knew this great sage hasn't driven a car, used the subway, boarded a commercial flight, or used an electrical appliance that wasn't powered by his own wind-driven generator in the last 30 years.   And then...oh hell, there are so many more examples of the woe-is-me-a-lone-voice-in-the-wilderness-that-knows-how-evil-America is. Vonnegut belongs to that genre of Western self-loathers who have benefited enormously from the capitalist system they hate. You'd think he might have considered settling in Sweden. Maybe he was put off by the socialist tax rate he'd have to pay.  
 Jim Hightower needs to quit stabbing people in the back. That is not how you solve America's problems. Another piece of pure fiction from a Michael Moore wannabee.  
 Are customers to guess what is a "small" size compared to a "large size?" Is the small for a todder, pre-schooler or teenager? What a waste of time trying to find information on this web-site about the sizes.  
 Don't waste your time on this book, there are more valuable ones out there. First of all, what has she DONE to the fabulous story of Shahrazad? Practically torn it apart and sewed it back together with very rough stitches. I read this book trying to get away from the stereotype some writers have of typical "weak" women (I am partial to strong heroines with wit) and therefore thought another retelling of Shahrazad would be just the thing.  Well, it turned out I was wrong and this book just had the stereotype I was looking to get away from. If you want a strong heroine, if you've been disappointed by this book and how it portrays Shahrazad, go read Cameron Dokey's version (called "The Storyteller's Daughter). In all, that is a much more satisfying read 
 She never has an appropriate ending. Can she go back to school and learn the "ABC's" of how to end a novel?  This was just lame.  You couldnt really get into the characters and I felt nothing for them.   Becasue of this book I will not read her novels again 
 I was absolutely horrified after reading the Fungi section in this book.  Most of the information is blatantly incorrect (mushrooms are not plants, the destroying angel does not cause death in six hours, etc).  Do NOT follow her belief that morels are a "safe and easy" mushroom to collect.  They have several poisonous look-alikes that the beginner can easily mistake for a morel.  The false morel can kill you if eaten raw or undercooked.  Worse, the very inaccurate drawings in the book look much more like a false morel or elfin saddle than a true morel.  As so many of the "facts" listed in the fungi section are wrong, I looked for more errors in the book and found them.  It made me very suspicious of the rest of the information it contains.  If you are looking for a good book on companion gardening get "Great Garden Companions, a Companion-Planting System for a Beautiful, Chemical-Free Vegetable Garden" by Sally Jean Cunningham 
 I bought this and Bad Cats the other day, and I have to say Bad Cats was far better. Bad Dogs is cute, but a little stupid. Almost all of the photos are dogs wearing costumes. Bad Dogs? No, Bad OWNERS. Get Bad Cats instead 
 The most unfortunate thing about this book is that you should have read Pratchett's other novels to catch some jokes about Rincewind, the wizards and other characters. My intention was to introduce a friend to Terry Pratchett's hilarious writing and was not able to use this book for that reason. I would probably have to use some other book, may be "Moving Pictures".   Apart from that, this book is only moderately funny and Pratchett resorts to some cheap puns here and there, which I found disappointing. This is a novel that seems like Pratchett wrote at the insistence of the publishers, but did not really have the energy to. 
 The images are what they call "best of" I was hoping for something new, not recycled pictures from the past few calanders 
 I thought this video was disjointed and not oriented to any plot. Also the lighting was very dark and much of what was going on was unseeable 
 Thirrin is a warrior princess. Now we know what will happen next, in any book where there is a warrior princess there is a war, AND the princess is always pretty green., this book is no exception. Her father dies leaves the country in her hands, it attacked, there is fighting, there is a desperate search for allies to aid the small country. The same old "Young Princess has to Fight Enemy" scheme.  Nothing new to rave about, just major flaws, like them hating the werewolves, them the next day loving them, it entirely consisting of renamed history and mythology. Oh yeah, unless you are writing a story that takes place IN Rome or a part of the world that used Latin in history, YOU DON'T USE LATIN. Parts were also dull, predictable, and just plain boring. Only the main characters had real personality, and even that was lacking. Maybe if it was more original, maybe if it was excuted better, maybe if Hill took some sort of writing class. Don't waste your time, read somthing like Prydain or Narnia instead.        
 What I wanted was some real information on HOW to homeschool my child with ADHD.  If I wanted help making the desision to homeschool my child I would have searched for that.  This book provides no real help in how to form a plan or curriculum.  It has absoluetly nothing to say about how to help your child learn, and quite frankly, despite the title there are few references to any child with ADHD.  I already know what it is, I already know what it does to my family, what I wanted was some real help, and this was NOT it 
 and that's what we got....the bird again.  Slowly paced, this story is mildly entertaining. I expected a bigger bang than what was given at the end...instead we see a blurred mythical big bird through water... It will keep your interest...but you will feel cheated by the end for wasting your time.   Rent, don't buy 
 I would have given this book no stars if I could.  My Bible study group and I went through Ransomed Heart and loved it.  I can't believe how disappointing this book is and I would not recommend it.  Mr. Eldredge hides his anger (barely masked), arrogance and deceit in this book.  Do not buy it 
 This item is absolutely worthless, don't waste your time! I'm returning mine to Target tomorrow.   There are laws against false advertising, I don't know why they're not enforced.  I will never buy ANYTHING made by Belkin again.   
 This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and "highly dubious" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a "massive intelligence failure" 
 This book was horrible I couldn't get into it all. I loved Black and ugly but Hustler's son was not as well written 
 Jim Knipfel is an idiot, truly. He's the type of person that delivers stories on characters like Werner Herzog and Ed Gein, very self-aggrandising, and, most significant to his idiot status, fails to understand anything at all. Want to be like Jim Knipfel? Quickly read a story in the newspaper, spend the next ten years watching The Nanny, then write a story based on what you read in the newspaper, and then assume the role of expert on the whole thing 
 I purchased these about 3 months ago.  They have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere.  I have been wearing them perhaps 2-3 times a week to the office and home.  They are already ripping in the back.   I wouldn't recommend them; however, I do get many compliments about how cute they are.  
 This book is like reading a trashy tabloid - lots of flashy big colour photos, low on substance. Obviously trying to cash in on current interest in forensics, each chapter is poorly written and is accompanied with 3 or 4 case studies.  The material in each chapter seems to be just common sense any adult could write about after doing minimal research and the case studies are too short, repetitive and sometimes don't even make sense.   Very disappointing. I suspect this book is intended for age group around 8-15 although it never says this anywhere 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 The only nice piece is Amarantine. The rest of the songs are very boring and lost some of Enya's "magic" 
 This what happens when you screw around with pro-tools and forget fix the mistakes. The guitar solo at the end of "Fearless" is so bad and phoned in, it's unbelievable. The keyboard playing is a joke throughout the whole CD, the guitar playing is brutally awful and lackluster, and the bass player sounds like he's playing two big rubber bands. Plus, if it's not the too many momentum-killing changes, then it's the lack of originality. No punch or intensity to be found on the whole damn disc. Oh, and let's not forget the singer, who sounds like he's singing through a tin can. Total Bull 
 In regard to a previous review Paul was on his way to Damascus not Emmaus.  The book's not that good but the record needs to be correct.  I would recommend you read Paul: A Novel by Walter Wangerin instead 
 I bought this recording with high hopes.  What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?  Well, not with this recording.  The cast is made up of "distinguished actors," the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line.  The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!  When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  For audio recordings, you need the best voices.  Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this.  My advice?  Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums 
 It's possible the women are funny, but I guarantee you the writing isn't. This is just awful. Big bold neon "laugh at the absurdity of this or that stupid foreigner stereotype! You'll never guess what happened! It was like, so weird, like, I mean, like, ohmygod!" I read 34 of its 200 pages, just because I was too lazy to get out of the beanbag and grab a better book. Six authors who can't write, and I have no reason to believe the others can. The intro by she who chose these essays also sucked. Don't waste your time. 
 The whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer.  In short, the disjointed story line goes like this: troubled angst-ridden teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit (whose face resembled Iron Maiden's Eddie!) who gives him advice/messages; he escapes death (a jet engine crashing through his roof) because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house; he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny; he discovers some old hag named Roberta Sparrow he knew was an ex. teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'Hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes'; same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him, but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected'.  Are you still with me??!!!  I love sci-fi and fiction, but all this is beyond ridiculous!  That, my friends, is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens' film is about!  I mean, 'Gigli' was a better film for chrissakes!  Even the made-up time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable.  In the end, the ONLY redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like The Church, Duran Duran, Joy Division, and Tears For Fears.  Hardly enough to save the film though.  If you must, rent 'DD' if your curiosity is piqued, but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your (or your parents') money 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 I'd be okay with a story that had 1 or 2 last-second escapes, but this book has at least 10, if not more!  I think the author spent too much time watching action films and incorporated every single escape trick into one book.  Even a Bond film would not go this far out on a limb.  They only other Reilly book I've read is The Contest, which I suppose was just as far fetched, but I give that one more latitude since it was science fiction and this one is not.  Another complaint is that a 16th century manuscript is woven into the story - which is not a bad idea - but there was no effort at all to change the language to the appropriate era.  The book does have a lot of action though... so if you like wild adventure and can completely suspend reality, you'd probably enjoy.  Appropriateness:  I would like to have recommended this as a fun action book for teens, but be aware that it contains a lot of language and a lot of violence.  There are many gruesome deaths of all varieties.  There is no sexual content or discussion of it 
 Chinese New Year's should be in color!  There are many other books with better drawings or color pictures than this one.  Very disappointin 
 While the 18 recipes in this cookbook (yes, you read correctly, 18) do represent traditional Greek cooking well, most of the recipes would be difficult for a young cook to make without adult supervision and assistance.  Traditional favorites such as baklava, spanikopita and stuffed grape leaves are included among the recipes.  The beginning of the book has cultural information about Greece and safe cooking tips.  This book would be helpful for a school project about Greece, but it is disappointingly short 
 Maybe it was the way this book was translated, but Alex Huber comes across as a close-minded, self-worshiping fascist!  I am a 20 year Yosemite local and can recognize his thinly veiled attempt to revise history and cast himself as the hero.  If I didn't know the truth, I would assume that Huber discovered Yosemite, was the first to think about free-climbing on the big walls and was planning to have his face carved on El Capitan!  A low point in the history of climbing books! 
 The two stars are for the entertainment value of this series. There's no doubt that Penn and Teller can put on a show. However, this series proves very little. They employ the same techniques they blast as B.S. to make their points: questionable "experts", misdirection, and even petty name calling. I have no doubt that most of the things they investigate really are B.S., but to say that Penn and Teller "prove" them wrong is stretching it. If you want to have a good laugh and see some wonderfully pathetic examples of human gullibility, watch this series. If you want to see well thought-out, unbiased skepticism, this isn't it. 
 Sangean is known for high-quality shortwave radios.  I assumed this quality and the reviews would help me break into HD FM.  I wish I had read the last review in this section before buying it.  The only good thing about the unit is that it does give clear reception for HD stations whose normal signal is fraught with signal degredation.    When listening to quality FM (non-HD) signals that are crisp and carry excellent frequency response and separation, this unit renders it as almost monaural and AM quality.  I couldn't believe it!    For FM stations (again non-HD) that are weaker, the unit further reduces separation and frequency response to give a quieter result.  This is non-defeatable, so you're stuck with it.  My boom box sounds better.  On another note, it offers many presets, but you can't surf through them.  You must press a "Preset" button and then the number.  If you are listening to the FM2 presets, you have to use the "Band" button to cycle through AM1 & AM2 to FM1 for those presets.  Very clumsy!    The only good thing I liked is the simple faceplate for others that may want to use it.  In summary, I was going to Ebay my Onkyo FM tuner for this one.  NO WAY!  I am seriously considering returning this tuner.  Read our lips.  Verrrry disappointing if you are a discriminating listener of music.  There is a reason that the other HD receivers are expensive.  Now I know. 
 I had to read this book for a college class, and it was not what I expected.  I liked "Defender of the Jews" but not the main novella, "Goodbye Columbus.&quot 
 One or two of the essays are interesting; the others are either fuzzy attempts at deep thinking ("We need new paradigms! Bartender! New paradigms all 'round!") or spend too much time touting whatever it is the authors have that they want advertised.  Inconsistent (in both level and quality), but with some buried nugget 
 I laughed at some of these, but alot of them just came across as bitching disguised as humor. I mean, biting humor is supposed to be about humor, not about just flat out hostility towards the butt of your joke 
 As someone whose adult ADHD diagnosis changed and enriched my life, I feel called to write a reaction to this book.  I truly feel I am part of the increasingly small number of people who HAD A TRUE and ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS.  Also, at my employement, I work with a guy who is diagnosised autistic, and feel I know him fairly well.   In contrary to what I feel this book is saying, I have been incredibly baffeled as to what autisim is, or any understanding of it what so ever.  I even told my parents, "I think autism is the opposite of whatever ADHD is."  I don't think I have ever been as shocked to read something as when I came across this book.  What comes to mind, is that ADHD is actually a rare disorder/blessing that many non-ADD (as well as autistic) children and adults are being falsly diagnosed as.  ADHD has been as abused and misunderstood as much as the way most of our modern educational systems have been to the true ADDers themselves!  I am curious about more on this topic, and will be watching for it.  On a personal level, however, all intution tells me that that ADHD, and especially ADD, are being twisted and contorted farther and farther away from its original discovery and meaning!  
 The professionals in the law field in this book aren't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become.  I understand not everyone becomes a six-figure-paid lawyer right out of law school, but this book is ridiculous.  It shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk?  Give me a break 
 I love a great escape and a good story.  This was none of the above.  It reminded me of dull elevator chat that you aren't really paying attention to anyway.    Rarely can I not finish a book, but that's not the case with this one.  
 The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one 
 This book smacks of having had its conception in the recognition of a niche in the academic market, rather than being driven by a thesis deeper than the (apparently) surprising revelation that war calls for the determined and systematic killing of the enemy.  Errors of citation and  overworked references I might have forgiven - the general lack of analysis  in any kind of depth, I could not.  Save your money.  Better yet, spend it  on Grossman's "On Killing", or Holmes' "Acts of War"  (arguably the outstanding work of this kind), and even Marshall's "Men  Against Fire".   Clive Gower-Collin 
 Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed 
 The handles on these knives, while having good balance, are the weak point.  These knives aren't meant to be thrown.  After minimal use they broke - at the handle 
 Contrary to popular opinion on this website, I found this book to be boring, repetitive and badly written. It was so boring I struggled to finish it during a journey where I had little else to do. This book summarizes a few events that were significant to Intel and offers advice on how similar business changes should be handled. Being an engineer, and not a manager, I found this to be vague and rambling. However I do agree with the book's title - Only the Paranoid survive. I think this outlook is useful for everyone, and not just business types 
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 no offense to this write but our teacher forced us to read this book... honestly i think most books suck. ive never read one i liked except maybe 2 or 3. i dont care if my teacher sees this because this is my opinion and she cant do a thing about it if she wanted to.. but i hated this book. who wants to read over the summer unless its a text message or letter, etc. from your friends. id rather spend my time with friends than read a book over the summer... especially this one 
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 Good premise and story line, for the most part a decent dialog, outstanding acting (except for the sleepwalking Gyllenhaal), so what's missing?  What's missing is plausibility.  A movie about grief doesn't have to dwell on it, but it MUST show early on that the grief is there.  If this is done properly, the viewer will accept even the most outlandish behavior as a character's way of dealing with that grief.  Kasdan did it brilliantly in 'The Big Chill,' with a mere thirty seconds of Glenn Close sobbing in the shower.  Silbering failed to do anything like that in `Moonlight Mile,' so the eccentric parents and the goofy fiance seem uncaring and preoccupied only with themselves.  I couldn't overcome it, even though I tried for a good while.  By the time Gyllenhaal bares his soul in court it's way too late; what might otherwise have been quite affecting seems only outlandish.        
 I really was interested in the topic of Arab history but found the writing so boring I had a hard time staying awake.  I finally gave up.  I would look for another book on this subject 
 I am very disappointed with this "book". And I use the term "book" loosely, it is really nothing more than one big commercial for her workshops 
 This was a well written book, and one I might have enjoyed......if I knew I was reading a secular novel.  I thought I was reading christian fiction, and waited thru almost the entire book for the christian message to shine thru.  I realized almost at the end of the book that was not going to happen. I had no reason to expect otherwise, as she has previously written christian fiction and I got it off the christian fiction shelf at the library.  I'm very glad I didn't pay for this book as I wouldn't have received what I thought I was paying for 
 I can't believe Jayne Ann Krentz actually wrote this one. The women in the book were stilted characters who accepted abuse and asked for more. What's with this? How insulting. It never got better. This was supposed to be 'true love'? Give me a break. It's going in the trash can. I wouldn't even give this one away. 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 I don't know about other company, but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture.  I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3, but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic.  There is no leather on the case at all. Not only that, the cover smells like petroleum oil 
 AWW Garth Nix I'm so disappointed :'( truly, I am. Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen were such good books but The Ragwitch was really bland. At frist I thought that it'd be really good, despite my friend saying it was going to be rubbish, and then... I read it. I couln't even finish it. I'm really sorry, I wish I didn't have to be such a kill joy but this book is really bad. I'm not going to be sour and give it a 1 but if you've read Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen then you'll know what I mean. If you havn't read thease books, then do so instead of this one because they are a hundered times better 
 First off, I'm not a fan of the writing style. It covers so much information and time with little dialogue, or characters for that matter. But that's just the style. The way the story was presented was what I had a problem with.  It seemed like the author had a lot of interesting ideas on what he thought the end times would be like, and he didn't want to write an end-times non-fiction spiritual book, so he just presented it as fiction, but didn't quite know how to do that.   Characters are introduced simply to experience the asteroid plumetting into the earth. Then, they drop off. All of a sudden, near the end, they come back, and now they're like generals or something, or leading some kind of airstrike during the battle of Armaggedon. WHAT?!   This book is a grid, a blueprint for a certain way it COULD happen. It is not a story about people, or a story with a plot. It is just a list of events that read on until Jesus comes.   The only reason I gave it two stars was because it didn't follow the whole rapture-theory at all(that word isn't in the Bible, and even implications of one doesn't say WHEN during the tribulation it would be). In this story, the Christians are here for the whole thing, and everything isn't quite so set and orlderly and expected like the Left Behind series. It follows the premise that throughout the last century or so, we've already experienced the Seal Judgements, and that the asteroid hitting earth is the beginning of a great cataclysm that mankind is about to face.  IF you want a different take and aren't expecting much of anything else, read this, but not if you want a real story with passion or voice.  
 GWTW certainly was one-sided in its portrayal of the Old South, and I can see how that could be a deal killer for a lot of readers.  Although I consider GWTW to be one of the greatest pieces of American literature ever written, I was VERY excited by the idea of TWDG.  The idea of building a "back story" around the black characters in Mitchell's novel is BRILLIANT!  So much could be done with this idea to address issues of race and slavery, as well as to broadside a popular piece of American literature through counterpoint.  Unfortunately, this great idea is wasted because Randall is utterly lacking in talent.  The thing that immediately bothered me about TWDG is the extraordinarily poor use of dialect.  One sentence has the main character narrating in perfect grammar with strong vocabulary and then in the next sentence she's all "he do dat" and "me go sleep."  Randall should have picked one voice for her main character and stuck with it.  This alone represents terrible hack writing, but I must go on and say something about the (snicker) "plot."  The plot, which should be subversive and controversial, fails to rise above the trashy romance novel level, and the (I think they're supposed to be shocking) sex scenes wouldn't shock anyone except my Amish Aunt Minnie.  I actually laughed out loud several times as I read them because I pictured Clark Gable/Rhett Butler saying some of this ridiculous dialogue.    The plot here is so flaccid that Randall inadvertently undermines her own book.  The white characters remain more interesting than any of the black characters.  This despite the fact Randall gives them tons of dirty linen to air in an obvious (and pathetic) attempt to make them interesting.  Her black characters are non-entities, which I believe was her beef with Mitchell in the first place....right?!   As a result, by writing TWDG, Randall is only spray painting a nasty word on the castle walls of GWTW when what she needed to do was bulldoze the original, dance gleefully on its grave, and create something very powerful in its place.  But that would take a skilled writer, and Randall just doesn't have the goods.  "Taking on" GWTW is a great idea, especially to stir up discussion around issues of racism and slavery in our country and our history.  However, to do an idea like that justice requires a talented author (i.e., not Alice Randall).  Maybe Toni Morrison should take this on?  I'd read that 
 These are not the original theatrical realeases. In addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films, American Cinematographer noted in their review of the DVD release that they had gone so far as to change the color-timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels. Though they are an impressive technical achievement, I'll be buying the academy award winning films that I saw when I was younger 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 It is a book that comes from the 30's and has stayed in the 30's.  Being such a technical subject full of quantitative proceedures and techniques, this book disregards it all to focus on qualitative bla bla.  This book is all about literature, don't expect to learn any technical insights or even less to see any numbers.  One can do much more either with a simple Financal Analysis text or even with Equities tutorials from the web.  Don't waste your time and money with this aged and useless book.  Just to let you know I am an Equities Portfolio Manager myself 
 I read this book after coming across it on a "most important books ever" list. I found it very hard to get through. Approximately half-way through the book I found myself counting down the pages until I finished it. This is not a book to read if you're looking to be entertained, however if you're looking for a good bit of culture/history I would think this would be a decent pick. Some of the passages involving the main character and his love interest are very well written and beautiful to read. In fact, I re-read some of the passages again just for the majestic quality of the author's writing. As a college junior with little knowledge of or interest in African culture I did not enjoy reading this book, however I may try again in the future to see if I can get more out of what others have deemed a very important and worthy novel 
 Tsukiyama knows hwo to write beautifully, BUT her metaphors and poeticisms feel too contrived. This novel is for lonely, flighty housewives. If you enjoy daytime soaps and/or exoticized perversions of the Asian culture, you'll love Dreaming Water 
 ick.  :) - i was impressed that hugh jackman had it all - good looks, acting and singing, but i was not impressed 
 We usually love all the Melissa and Doug toys, but these sound puzzles are disappointing.  I bought two for Christmas, the farm one and the vehicle one.  We couldn't open the back to put in the batteries for the vehicle puzzle (as the other reviewer said), and for this farm one, the sound quality is so bad!  The animal sounds aren't even recognizable in some cases.  The puzzle itself is fine, but I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the sound 
 I purchased this book after reading an excerpt of it, and it has exceeded all of my expectations and then some. Dr. Saltz outlines her theories and explains them in a way that we can all relate to(EVERYONE has done some storytelling), in a way that makes sense, and to top it off it doesn't want to make you run out and get mad at the world for all of your problems, if anything it makes you a little more empathetic. I'm a firm believer in the theory that you can't successfully change what you don't understand, and this book helps to provide that understanding in a concise way. Dr. Saltz gives numerous examples of patterns of behavior, how you may have come to exhibit it, and how you can change it (if that's what you want to do). For anyone that feels stuck or just confused about why their life is the way it is, this book is an excellent tool to help clear up some confusion. It's not preachy and is written in a conversational way that's easy to read. This book has helped me immensely 
 The range on this product is no where near what was advertised.  I purchased (2) units and neither will work consistently beyond 4-5 feet from mac.  Attempted to improve operation by relocating mac, using USB extension cable, and changing ID on transmitter with no improvement.  Extremely disappointed 
 This book is a waste of time. It is boring, pedantic, unoriginal, forced, poorly written and of no practical use to music educators. Most of the theoretical ideas do not belong to Jorgensen herself; she owes her few good  ideas to other scholars in music education who Jorgensen fails to credit.  So, add poor scholarship to the above 
 Yes, this book was good in that it seemed to accurately portray the breakdown of a family when one of its members actually "breaks down".    However, it is an extremely depressing book in that no one seems to get any better.  Angie floats around, mostly in a paranoid state, in and out of hospitals, group homes and her own home.  Luke leaves college, leaves his girlfriend, drifts around for a while, then gets back with his girlfriend and goes back home (doing what, I'm not sure - the book wasn't clear on that).  Pieter keeps playing his cello and wallowing in self pity.  And Jordana never fully copes or even comes to term with Angie's illness.  She is also drifting.  This may be reality, but it is an extremely depressing reality.  I have read "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and loved it.  This book is NOTHING like "Cuckoo Nest". 
 Purists will argue that once an author has died then his output has finished. Others will argue that there's no compelling reason not play in someone else's imaginary universe if there are good new stories to be told. Certainly there's a thriving market for new Sherlock Holmes stories. I myself don't mind a continuation novel or pastiche if it's well written and captures the flavour of the original.  This book fails on both counts for me. Ultimately this is just a mystery with robots in it. Without Asimov's name to spruik it I doubt most of us would bother picking it up. Tiedemann is not a bad author but this is dry, technical stuff for the most part. His characters aren't badly drawn and there's some mildly interesting discussion of new aspects of the Three Laws but there's long, dense passages of technobabble that simply beg to be skimmed.  Some will like the dense, convoluted conspiracy, I found it tedious.   Bottom line is I'm not inspired to read the other two books in the series, which about sums up my indifference to this one 
 The only reason I am rating this book a 1 is to get my father's attention - Matthew Henry "Jake" Jacobson. I have not seen or heard from you in 10 years. Hope you are enjoying your travels in Cambodia more than you enjoyed your daughter 
 There are two thing that I don't like about this set. The curlers get too hot to handle and the lid isn't attached to the base which is very inconvenient. I wouldn't recommend them 
 Carolyn Chute is well able to evoke a sense of place in which these  Northeastern hillbillies live by describing the detritus of their yards as  well as their lives.  However, the story meanders--again, not unlike the  aimless day-to-day existence of the characters she describes. Her  characterization provides the Beans and their friends and neighbors with a  rough dignity, although not enough to keep them from seeming pitiable to a  "sophisticated" urban readership 
 While this book has a lot of great information, it's very hard for me to sit down and read.  Here's an example of a writing style:  Under "Quitting Programs" the author writes "If I had a twisted and warped sense of humor, I'd simly tell you to quit applications by pulliiing your Mac's power cord from  the wall socket.  (Luckily, I don't.)  There are, however, more sane ways to  exit a program..."  If you're like me, and this style drives you up the wall, try another book, because this book has examples like this on every page.  It just gets tiring reading past the cute to get to the meat 
 This could have been a fabulous story with interesting and compelling characters. Instead, we have another self-indulgent wallow in the world of fox-hunting and so-called gracious southern living. I gave up on Rita Mae Brown several years ago when she stopped writing inventive and intriguing novels and started writing stories about talking animals. Recently I picked up Hotspur hoping some of the old zing had come back into her writing. Sadly, it hasn't 
 The book concentrates on only a few scholarships and if you are not targeting one of these scholarships, the book is a waste of money 
 With fantastic electrotango like Gotan Project and BajoFondo Tango Club this was a huge disappointment 
 ...and that emptiness and boredom and blankness are the only emotions which author transferred to me as his reader through the medium of his words and it feels like a disease which is called "I am one of GenXers". While being not exactly the effect the author probably aspired to achieve by his novel, it perfectly matches with the true state of lives and feelings of the people like the ones acting roles in his story. And by this, the work proves the eternal unity of the art and real life, both always creations of the creator.. 
 Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house 
 I am a lover of Japanese movies. I even purchased a masterpiece (Sadakan No. 8) for $50 for a VHS. I have a huge collection of Japanese jems.  So I know what I'm talking about. Heck I'm even Japanese myself :-)   But let me tell you--MABOROSI must mean MAJOR BORING..This movie can be condensed easily into 30 minutes and probably be still too boring. Yumiko is traumatized as a kid as grandma says she wants to go away and die...please stop you are too young to die..but grandma leaves anyway and Yumiko dreams about this repeatedly. Yumiko has a hubby and kid and hubby commits suicide. She mops throughout the movie from start to finish. She wears nothing but black and rarely smiles and sustains a flat affect. A totally unrealistic movie; in real life, Yumiko would have to worry about getting a job and pay bills rather than worrying about her psychological traumas because she has a kid to take care of. (her husband was some kind of laborer.)   THE MOVIE IS DREADFULLY BORING. BORING. BORING. BORING. It goes into trivial daily life and irrelevant conversations and becomes the whole of the movie with very little plot. It goes on and on and on making you sleepy sleepy sleepy...   Masterpiece--HOW ON EARTH????? It's another example how winning an international film prize does not necessarily mean it is good.   Now if you have problems with insomnia or need a sleep remedy-please by all means purchase this. It's hard to follow only because it puts you to sleep sooo well! I'm not exaggerating.   If you decide to purchase this BORING movie, and believe the hype of the critics as it is highly overrated, well, I warned you.   Thank you 
 If you go the largest imported books bookstore in Beijing, which is located in Wangfujing, and grab this title from the shelves, you will find that several paragraphs in the book have been covered with a white paper strip: my own educated guess is that one probably dealt with Beijing's traffic congestion and the other with a certain bloody episode which happened on Tian'anmen Square in 1989.  I asked an employee what this meant. "The content must have been politically harmful", was the answer. There was no trace of embarassment in his voice. Business as usual...    Nevertheless, the book is available. Who will want to buy a blatantly censored copy for what is still a high price remains an open question. This may sound anecdotal but it isn't. It just shows how little things have really changed although China is reputedly the land of Change. I must congratulate the author for having written some "politically incorrect" stuff about Peking (let's stick to the old name, it is so much easier to pronounce), but I have to disagree with his general appraisal of the city. It is quite true that, as he states in the preface, Peking has been  a "global irrelevance" for many decades, but it is simply false to claim that it is now an "exciting time" to visit the Chinese capital.    Think about this: John Blofeld (1913-1987), a British scholar who wrote books on Eastern philosophy and religion, and traveled extensively in Asia, including China, reports in one of his travelogues that when he visited Peking in what are for us "the good old times", before the Communist takeover that is, local people were already complaining that the old ways had disappeared.   Today, more than half a century later, after the Great Cultural Revolution and the demolition of the magnificent city walls, Peking finds itself in the midst of what in fact amounts to a second Cultural Revolution: an unprecedented, huge urban overhaul designed to turn it into a futuristic metropolis.   To sum it all up, Peking has completely lost its soul and one must ask: Where is the excitement, really? Are we talking about the five-stars hotels with their international buffets? Are we talking about the fact that local people can now buy French foie gras in the nearest supermarket? Are we talking about those glass and steel skyscrapers that have turned large areas of the city into what looks like a kind of alien Martian base? If that is something that makes you excited, yes, then by all means do visit the city. You will be satisfied.   Leaving aside the architectural monstrosities of the recent past and those that are being built in complete disregard to the ancient city environment, let us have a look at Peking's much publicized cultural heritage. Is it really worth seeing?   My answer is a definite NO. Keep your money for Pompeii, Tikal, Versailles or Angkor Vat. First of all, unless you are acquainted with Chinese culture, chances are that you will not be able to appreciate what you see. Just as it takes some time to appreciate a book or a piece of music. The reason is that Chinese architecture is not spectacular at all. And it is quite devoid of originality. If you have seen one pagoda, you have seen them all. Besides, you probably can't read Chinese characters. Chinese art is an extension of the writing system.   But there are many other factors that combined will probably make a visit to Peking quite disappointing, if not infuriating (for a sensitive traveler, that is). First of all, the crowds of tourists, both foreign and Chinese. They are overwhelming (and unfortunately most interesting sites have rather short opening hours). Second, the ruthless commercialism and incredibly bad taste: the merchants of the Temple are omnipresent. I am not only talking about nagging vendors, souvenirs shops, noisy fast-foods and bars inside the premises, but also about big and small advertising boards and a multitude of ugly modern artefacts that mar both the great monuments and the more modest ancient alleys ("hutongs").   A few examples: if you go to the Forbidden City, you will find pistachio green plastic garbage cans everywhere. The benches inside the palace all bear advertising plaques for a company that sells air conditioners. If you visit the( few remaining)hutongs, you will find that the old houses are lined with brand-new cars and that their faï¿½ades are marred by big air conditioners. Near the Forbidden City, the hutongs are dotted with ugly telephone booths in the shape of an orange mushroom (yes!)every five or ten meters. The tiles on most pavilions and pagodas are made of ugly, grey concrete (the real thing is too costly). There must be more than a hundred big, red fire extinguishers in the otherwise quite beautiful Lama Temple and there are alas not hidden from view. Roofs around Tian'anmen Square are bristling with huge, unsightly mobile phone towers. The wonderful animal and human statues in the Spirit Way, which is part of the huge Ming Tombs Site, are all flanked by a big plastic garbage can and they have built new roads on both sides of it: enough noise to scare away the spirits and prevent you from entering a meditative state...  Etc., etc., etc. There is no end to the list of things both small and great that spoil the remnants of the past in Peking and elsewhere in China, which shows just how culturally decadent Chinese people have become. One could without exaggeration say that today the urban culture in China is an extension of Las Vegas and Hollywood with some Chinese elements thrown in for good measure (and face!).   Sometimes the incongruities are so blatant, so ludicrous that one starts wondering if there isn't a kind of conspiracy, a deliberate attempt to debase and desecrate the past, which is after all just superstitious rubbish for a true Communist and a mere merchandise for a true Capitalist (they are pretty much the same in my opinion). The alliance of the two has produced what may be the biggest kitsch paradise on earth: Pe-kitsch.  The third point you need to keep in mind is the weather, which can be summed up as: cold winter smog, spring sandstorms and smog, summer sauna and smog (+heavy rains in July) and dry autumn smog. Twenty years ago(yes, I have lived that long here!), Peking had a Mediterranean climate of sorts with clear blue skies most of the time, but due to heavy traffic pollution the city has now smoky skies with no wind and therefore a suffocating atmosphere most of the time (let's say about 70 percent of the time). In many places, the air stinks with the smell of chemical paint. It is also full of dust particles from the thousands of construction sites, to say nothing of the exhaust fumes from the hundreds of thousands of trucks, bulldozers and private cars that race through narrow alleys and oversized avenues alike.    The fourth point is traffic. It is increasingly difficult to go from one place to another without being caught in huge traffic jams (the government actually encourages people to buy cars and they hope every household will have its own car by 2020!!!). The happy times when you could go around leisurely riding a bicycle are basically finished. Now the streets have become a battleground and cars crowd even the sidewalks. The subway network is pitifully inadequate and incredibly crowded. As another expat once said to me: "I never take the Beijing subway because to find the nearest subway station, I have first to take a taxi."  The fifth point is service. While young shop assistants and other employees are generally friendly (but not always competent), a large part of the local staff, specially in parks, museums and big supermarkets, is composed of (sexually frustrated?)middle-aged women who are rude, indifferent and lazy. There is a pervading mood of discontent and irritation in the city, which is quite comprehensible considering the high level of environmental stress, the lack of genuine community life (most "local" people are rootless domestic immigrants)and the political tyranny. Add to this the fierce competition for jobs, the money problems and all the cares inseparable from both great and modest affluence (blessed are the poor, indeed!). Almost everyone will try to rip you off. Money reigns supreme.    This is not to say that there aren't any beautiful or interesting places to see--the author of this guide has done a good job in this respect since he mentions not only the (fake) Great Wall at Badaling, but also other segments of the wall in wilder areas-- but most of them are outside the city. Or you have to be in the Forbidden City on a cold, rainy day or at the peak of a media-orchestrated flu epidemic, when the crowds are away. Even then, you will have to close your eyes often in order not to see all the jarring details I mentioned before.   You may appreciate the cheap food. The poor will still smile at you and greet you (while the new middle-class rich won't even look at you). The huge parks provide a welcome respite from the ugliness and noise of the rest of the city, but they are quite ordinary and, like the whole place, not genuinely Chinese, but a sloppy mixture of styles. Even here, under the shadow of gracious willows, your contemplation of the beautiful lotus ponds will often be interrupted by the awful noise of spitting indigenous males clearing their throats. This is China!  Remember the white tags of censorship in the book. And know that contrary to what the cover photograph wants you to believe, very few young people in Peking practice kungfu. These days they prefer to play basket-ball. electronic games.    PS: Read the "Ugly Chinaman" by Boyang to understand why this country has become such a mess.     
 If I had seen this in a bookstore, I would have passed it up.  The book is flimsy and the bear is very small.  The diaper  pants for the bear are very tiny and difficult to put on, so my little boy doesn't really get any benefit from them.  I don't care for the format of having parent notes on  the same page as the story.  In all, very disappointing 
 After seeing some of the other Amazon reviews of this movie, and the fact that Jason Swartzman was in it (after having seen him for the first time in "Rushmore" - a wonderful film), I had to purchase a copy of this DVD for myself to view.  It's got a wonderful cast of fine actors, but I found this movie really dumb.  One critic on the DVD box claimed this was "Laugh Out Loud Funny."  Really?  What movie was he watching?  I strained a chuckle here and there, but that was about it for me.  The Lily Tomlin & Dustin Hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script.  I know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie, but I didn't find much to snicker about.  
 but that is about all, there is not much information on anything in the book, i think it is for those who are just entering the world of Anim 
 I'm sorry to have to give another negative review to one of Katherine Valentine's books, but again, this is just a rip-off of the Mitford books.  She even has a big, unruly dog....just like Jan Karon's books!  The characters are such obvious copies of the characters in the Mitford books that it becomes a real annoyance. And again, her version of Catholicism is a little skewed.  She acknowledges several priest friends in the preface to her book....did she get them to read it carefully?  For example, she refers to "The Sacred Heart of Mary".  What??  It's the "Immaculate Heart of Mary"....we only refer to Jesus' Sacred Heart.  These and other errors just jump off the page to an even moderately well-educated Catholic.  "Rent A Nun"????  Give me a break. 
 I ordered two of them - one was broken; the other developed a hairline crack as soon as I put water in it.  I'll order another butter bell, but I guess this is a case of you get what you pay for - inexpensive, and cheaply made.  I'll keep that in mind when I order other NorPro products.  
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 After volunteering to look at this play for my Classics degree, I started out with high hopes.  But after opening it and dicovering how boring it was, my hopes faltered.  I still gave it a go though and a couple of hours later when I finally got ready to start writing whether it was actually good enough as a play, my problems started.  Bearing in mind that it was written 2500 years ago, i was intrigued that a play could last for so long.  But honestly, thats where my interest stopped.  It's lenghthy and dull, and although I know that it is a very historical and precise play, I just couldn't follow it.  If you want bedtime reading that will send you to sleep, this is the one, sorry 
 Reading through reviews of this text, I notice two main criticisms and will address them separately.  The first is that the book has some sort of liberal bias.  As far as I am concered, no bias of this sort is present.  I hold my textbooks to the same standard that I hold news outlets, and I found The American Pageant to be just as objective as the BBC or The Washington Post.  Dr. Bailey looks at both sides of controversial issues, does not, despite the beliefs of other reviewers, pan President Reagan, and has plenty of criticism of the left.  Why, then, the low rating?  This has to do with issue number two, namely Dr. Bailey's writing style.  It is, in a word, irritating.  He feels the need to bring ridiculously flowery language and bizarre metaphors into every situation.  I counted at least six comparisons of national banks, Wall Street moguls and railroad barons to octopuses.  Teddy Roosevelt had, according to Dr. Bailey, "mule-like molars" which he "bared at liberals and reactionaries alike".  It's extraordinarily difficult to cut through the (pardon my French here) merde and figure out what on earth is going on.  I'm not looking for a dry history book, really I'm not.  I believe American history can be interesting without bordering on the insane.  Dr. Bailey crosses the line from making his readers think that he may be insane to actually making his readers go insane.    I've not read any other US History textbook, so as far as I know this may be the best one.  I certainly hope not, for all of our sakes 
 I'm hoping that most of the people who wrote these reviews didn't actually stoop so low as to buy the book.  I read a few pages of it, and this is truly 7th-8th grade level writing.  I didn't realize that Bill's narcissism extended to the point at which he actually thought his writing was INTERESTING, rather than just blatantly one-sided and sickeningly arrogant.  Bill should stick to repetitive, "I know better," conservative babble - it gives us liberals/radicals/freethinkers something to make fun of 
 As a political junkie, I loved reading "Election 2004", for the behind-the-scenes peek at the candidates' campaigns (well, mostly Kerry's). However, if you are to enjoy the book, you must realize that:  a) Newsweek is very pro-Kerry. b) the Bush campaign (wisely) kept them at arms-length.  So we get fawning adulation over Kerry's daughters, while Bush's twins are treated as snide pranksters. Laura Bush is "simple", while Teresa Heinz Kerry "takes charge". The Swift Boat Vets are "grudge-bearing" while 527s like Moveon.org are "groundbreaking". Kerry's team used "sound strategy" while Karl Rove and Karen Hughes cooked up "dirty tricks". You get the picture.  If you can stomach the liberal spin, it's still a good read and does provide a few tantalizing tidbits (especailly about Dean and how he was perceived by both the Democrats [crazy, self-destructive] and Republicans [manna from Heaven]).  The left-wing slant is made more bearable by the fact that Bush won 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 In the book Catherine stops a lot of guys from marrying her .She does that because she doesn't want to get married .Catherine likes to catch stuff on fire like guy who try to marry her. She also hides from her chores all the time because it makes her look like a good wife .She hates writing her journal. She also hates her father trying to marry her off 
 It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either 
 This is garbage.  This "author" uses the term 'guys' for wiseguys.  It is sooooo anoying that I just had to stop reading it.  Use mafia, wiseguys, whatever.  Try reading the word 'guys' about 20 times a page and see how sick you are of it. this person was not a mob 'guy' so don't bother with this book.  as a matter of fact I will sell you mine very cheap 
 I have to agree with the reviewers who were disappointed in this book.  I have to admit that I discounted their reviews and took the book out of the library anyway-it was free, and I enjoyed "Rosemary's Baby" so much I figured I had nothing to lose.  And I didn't; I mean it was somewhat amusing, but nowhere near as much so as the first one.  Ira Levin is very talented at producing good page-turners but this book could have been a lot more interesting.    Rosemary's Baby had a kind of dry, dark humor and was quite riveting-I have no idea where he was planning on going with this book though.  I kind of liked the idea that maybe Rosemary had some free will to begin with and was exploring the consequences of her life choices in this book and ultimately perhaps had a chance at redemption, but Levin was so cryptic and this book so ambiguous that it is hard to know what to read into it.  Mysteries are fun; complete confusion isn't. 
 I would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks.  The walker seemed great for the price, it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it. Unfortunately, the design is terrible on the Sounds N'Lights feature.  It began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it.  After much frustration trying to get "to" the battery compartment to replace it, we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all.  The internal battery is soldered in place.  Once it loses it's original charge, you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby 
 One wonders how a corporare board would react when the disccovered that Jesus-CEO had put Mark 10:21 into effect as a corporate policy.  Really, this has to be the dumbest title in history. 
 Never having read Macomber before, I picked up Susannah with interest, hoping to discover the secret of her popularity. While the premise of this book is a promising one, it never reached it's potential. Susannah as a character is oh so nice, and for a woman in her 50's, remarkably impetuous and self-absorbed. Her husband Joe is incredibly mild mannered and forebearing, and daughter Chrissy, evidently meant to be charmingly naive and innocent, comes across as petulant and spoiled. As so often happens with writers who turn out book after book, Macomber annoyingly depends too much on favorite phrases (e.g., he "wound his arm around her waist"). Less than halfway through this story, its central "mystery" became transparently predictable, and in the final 30 pages, all the pieces fell conveniently into their happy ending places. On the positive side, Macomber did a terrific job portraying the insidiousness of Alzheimer's. Perhaps her earlier novels are more skillfully written 
 Unbelievable. I mean come on, we're only talkin about a few minutes here.  Missing some of the funniest scenes in the 1st movie including the German Jacque Cousteau character scene.  I didnt even know the laserdisc version was an 'extended' version until now.  Thank god I still have the laserdisc.  Another incident of movie companies raping the public.  Grrrrrh.. 
 This one is just plain awful!!   It's a bunch of Hollywood brats being histrionic.  
 I didn't get past the first 5 pages because it was too boring. It was like being back in 10th grade biology all over again. 
 This is one of Dylan's worst albums (alongside Dylan and the Dead and Down in the Groove).  Many of us Dylan fans like to argue which is worse, this one or Down in the Groove.  This one is worse.  A hodge podge of recording sessions hastily thrown together, it has a "let's get this f---er out and let the fans decide whether it's good or not" feel to it.  There are only 2 songs that are really worth your attention.  The first, "You Wanna Ramble", has a really good groove to it, but the second, Brownsville Girl, is a Dylan masterpiece.  Brilliantly written (with Sam Shepard)and performed (with a great vocal by Dylan and the choir).  It runs 11 minutes, and feels short, because it's so good.  The song They Killed Him runs 4 minutes and feels longer than Gone With the Wind, which gives you an indication of how wretched the song really is.  It does, however, have a great title, and the cover art is pretty good.  Perhaps Dylan should have taken the best songs from this album and Down in the Groove, and made one album out of it.  Here's a suggestion of the tracks...  Side One 1.  You Wanna Ramble 2.  Let's Stick Together 3.  Silvio 4.  Death is Not the End 5.  Ninety Miles an Hour (Down a Dead End Street)  Side Two 1.  Brownsville Girl 2.  Rank Strangers to Me  Just my 13 and a half cents...  
 99 mins of suck..good thing i don't have a life..some nudity (eva mendes' fun bags?) definitely would have raised this movie another star..couldn't wait to look at the talent files(he he)  after the movie was over..can't wait for the next one 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 This book will appeal only to people who have vested interest in playing down the effectiveness of herbal products - such as pharmaceutical companies, physicians and others who wouldn't make any money if people didn't need their services any more and were able to heal themselves or maintain good health naturally through the use of herbs.   The title of the book is a misnomer. Tyler doesn't offer any information on how to use the herbs - as a matter of fact, from the way he describes them, you'd be sure he never ever touched, or tasted any herb. If you're read this book, you'll discover that there's no point in using any herbs because there are only two categories for herbs in this book: they either fall in the category of worthless or deadly.  Tyler does his best to downplay or completely disparage the effectiveness of every single herb mentioned, and when he is unable to prove that the particular herb is ineffective, then he states that even though the herb was empirically effective, there is no sufficient research to back it up.   The book is basically loaded with information on why you should not bother using any of the herbs listed in this book - either because in Tyler's opinion they are ineffective or they could be dangerous. And for the herbs that have been proven effective and were in use for centuries, Tyler states how "pharmaceutical industry" lost interest in these herbs. Of course they lost interest - how would they have interest in herbs if they cannot patent that are available everywhere? On the other hand, because of people's interest in herbs, you'll find shelves at your drug store loaded with natural supplements.  Some people just don't want to poison themselves with pharmaceutical products (for that matter, you may want to check out compenium of pharamceutical products to find out how deadly side-effects of those can be).  If pharmaceutical industry can not make money, why would they still be interested? And to state that this book is free of commercialism, just "honest" herbal - what a joke!  For burdock, which is a blood purifier, Tyler further states "in spite of its long use as a folkloric remedy, no solid evidence existst that burdock exhibits any useful therapeutic activity."  (Burdock happens to be one of the four herbs which have proven very effective in helping people heal innumerable diseases, cancer being one of them, because it does help to detoxify the body.)  About Chickweed, Tyler writes: "Despite the fact that it is prominently listed in almost every catalog of herbs currently available and also that many writers describe it as a valuable herb, I can think of no good reason to allow space to this worthless weed. ... Let's not waste any more time and space on the imagined medicinal value of this ineffective herb." (On a personal note, chickweed is a popular herbal supplement for weight loss...)  And, well, I can only suggest that you invest your money in some other, decent and honest, herbal that actually offers some useful information regarding the use of herbs.  Do consult a genuine herbalist who is truly interested in helping people. Tyler's heart only beats for pharmaceutical industry.  
 The book explains the menu options on Google Analytics.  Nothing more.  If you can't figure out the menu options on Google Analytics perhaps you should look into a different line of work 
 It takes around 3-4 seconds to take the picture after I click the button!! And then another 8-10 seconds just to store that picture on the SD card!!  So basically, I cant take another picture until atleast 10-15 seconds of one picture!! 
 I purchased this book hoping it would help me show a novice how to start modeling for games. While the author covers the overview and technical terms, the essential modeling instruction is severely lacking. The book talks about creating detail but fails to deliver quality examples.   I bought this title because I own a few of the author's other works including the 3ds max bible. This was a dissapointment because it fails to provide the information on technical skills while it raises false hopes of earning money from games, if folks use this resource. (Read back of book cover)  The up side to this book is in the overview. It does introduce the information and resources needed for the game industry, and it covers the basic concepts of animation and modeling, but does not mention many important pit falls common to many an aspiring beginner 
 This book is quite esoteric and very theory-based.  I was looking more for a book that would assist me in learning to use accupressure rather than understand it's development and philosophy. For anyone interested in a book that is more aimed at treatment, try Acupressure Potent Points: A Guide to Self-Care for Common Ailments by Michael Gach, an excellent resource 
 One need not be worried if liberals are under the bed. However, be afraid, be very afraid, if cancervatives are in the White House ( as the last six years have illustrated in spades...)   Nice kiddie book by the way. Was this tactic borrowed from the Hitler youth movement by any chance?   
 This book started out entertaining but then it really dragged on.  Maybe I didnt understand something, but I felt the second half of the book was really a waste of my time.  I had a really hard time finishing it 
 I had never eaten a Luna bar before I made this purchase, so I had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled.   When I read "chocolate Pecan Pie" .. I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base.  What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar.   In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my "purchase" list   
 I really don't mean to sound judgmental but this was the very worst book I have ever read.  I mean even Nancy Drew books have more of a mystery than this one did.    I have always heard good things about the Jesse Stone Novels.  This was the first and only one I will read.  I don't know if the grammatical errors were the author's fault or the editor's.  Even the dialogue between characters didn't even have complete sentences.  Very poor sentence structure.  I agree with C. Richard's review..."Distracting" in that there are terrible grammar errors throughout this entire book and was hard to focus.  Ths story was contrite and very easy to figure out way before the end of the book who the culprit was.  This is the only review I have given that has been a poor one.  
 "To Rescue a Rogue", Jo Beverly's Rogue finale, has a promising beginning, with Lady Mara St. Bride showing her spunk in extricating herself from a potentially ruinious situation and enlisting Lord Darius "Dare" Debenham's help.   He discretely cleans her up, and suddenly, she determines that she loves Dare  and always has.  Alas, he sees her in a sisterly way ... though her cleavage impresses him.  But wait! he loves her, too!  Melodramatic conflict arises in Dare's attempts to conquer his opium addiction and be worthy of her love, and how she pines for him.  Rather than her own strength of character, Mara attributes her legendary Black Ademar St. Bride hair as the explanation for her grit.  Meanwhile all the Rogues swirl around and Mara is suitably impressed.  Can they rescue Dare from Society's censure?  Will Mara and Dare ever marry?  Will Mara ever stop whining?  And what about her tonnish stalker who attempts to rescue Mara from Dare's overly public kiss?  Sadly, I found myself rooting for the stalker.  Beverly is an otherwise excellent writer, but with this one she fell short.  
 Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world 
 I feel like I must excuse myself for giving this book such a low rating. I am big Ted Dekker fan. Love his Circle Trilogy and am THRILLED he is going to be continuing that series next February. I thoroughly enjoyed his two "Blessed" books, his "Martyrs" series and his stand alone novels like Bling, Thr3e, Showdown and Saint. Didn't care for House at all but I will blame that on Peretti :)   What didn't I like about this book?   I thought the story itself was just predictable. I had to plow through chapter after chapter of the exact same story just to get to an ending that made me yawn. Run from the bad guy, chop off a finger, kill 7 people, you are ugly, i am ugly, we are all ugly...blah blah blah.....zzzzzz  Then when you do get to the ending Dekker decides yet again to somehow tie this book into the Circle Trilogy by making some vague references to the Horde. I loved the tie ins to the Circle Trilogy with "Showdown" and "Saint" but by "Skin", my reaction was "c'mon, give me a break". And like his last couple of books this one had a surprise ending too...but it was just so lame... my reaction was more of "you have got to be kidding me"...  Honestly, this book just hacked me off. Was looking forward to it for a long time and then when I read it it felt like I got robbed. 
 This is a stupid book.  I got about half way through and stopped reading.  Blech.  Stilted language and not one character to root for.  The main character (Jane McGuire) is petulant, rude and for all her "worldliness" is very childish.  She seems to be constantly stamping her beautiful little foot and uttering "Damn you!!!"  She insists on doing as she pleases and all the responsible adults around her roll over, declare that she knows best, and allow her to do it.  And she is such an irresistible "woman" that 34 year old Mark Trevor salivates over her (this part is just weird) as do almost all of the other male characters.  And she is portrayed to be so much older than 20 year old Jock and 23 or so Mario.  Puh-lease.  Oh, yeah.  Ya gotta love how the ridiculous plot includes ancient treasure, international terrorism, and numerous references to 9/11 and Homeland Security.  Ooohh.  This is my first IJ book and surely my last.  I got to page 250 before bailing on it.  What was the publisher thinking 
 Detailed look at the workings of the Agency and the influence of its Directors on work and morale; however, the author presented an uncritically positive characterization of Tenet and an equally rosy portrayal of President Bush's handling of foreign affairs. The author ignores lingering questions and concerns (e.g. where are the weapons of mass destruction, statements by the Administration linking Hussein and al Qaeda), frequently uses partisan language and soundbites to describe President Clinton, and, overall, comes off as an apologist for the current Bush Administration 
 very disappointed with this CD; only has about 2 songs on there that are worth listening t 
 This movie is only good for those that "love" Alyssa Milano.  Plot?  It isn't non-existent.  It DOES exist but it's a complete crap!  Period.  Just an excuse to show skin.  Regarding the DVD, it's a barebones one but picture and audio quality is as good as most New Line Cinema releases, anamorphic and stuff, plus it's the best release of the movie if we compare it with releases in other regions.  You won't be disappointed in that aspect 
 I watched this movie after hearing how highly rated it was. VERY disappointing. Musical score over shots around Russia, or Europe. I couldn't tell since there was no story, no words (even subtitles). Just a guy with a movie camera recording everyday people in their daily lives.  The music was NOT good, certainly not great. Even movies like The Third Man (1949) had amazing music. Not here.  So you have video and music, with no plot. No words, even silent era subtitles like Chaplin-NOTHING. If the music and video can't keep you interested... Skip this.  There are great films from this era. This is not one of them.  Walt D in L 
 Reading the reviews for this book I thought it would be a more substantial book than what I found.  It is a cute idea, but it is lacking in content.  Very disappointed...will probably end up as a garage sale book 
 Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of "Life sucks and then you die"?  What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?  AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids 
 The book explains the evolution of standard 26-letter Latin alphabet focussing mostly on the early evolution of the letters from proto-Sinaitic through Phoenician, Greek, Etruscan and Latin and also looking very closely at the Aramaic stream which produced modern Hebrew characters.  It is lavishly and beautifully printed in black and red on very heavy (almost carboard) stock with the various letter shapes appearing in the text in red. There are a large number of clear hand drawings and a few very clear photographs of important early inscriptions. To some Ouaknin may seem too concerned that every shape that every letter ever took should be shown and explained. But far better a reference book that contains too much rather than not enough.  If you want to learn to read some of these early scripts and became familiar with ancient letter form this book provides lots of genuine material to practice on, especially if you know Hebrew or Greek and can read many of these inscriptions. If you can't they will mostly just be pretty pictures.  But there are some serious downsides to this book if you want to use it for anything but epigraphical reference.  Ouaknin pushes hard a dubious and undemonstrable hypothesis that the alphabet was invented by Israelites in Egypt but provides no evidence whatsover, just quotations from another writer Gérard Pommier. Ouaknin associates the original pictograph for G with the meaning "camel" rather than "throw stick" for no other reason than he wishes to believe despite archaelogical evidence that camels were associated with Hebrews in the patriarchal period. Maybe they were and the evidence just hasn't yet been found. But that's a bad reason to favor one interpretation over another when neither says anything about the independant issue of when domestication of the camel first occurred.  Israelites are as likely a candidate for inventing the alphabetas  any other Semites. But they are no more so. It is special pleading to argue that the reason later forms of the writing system lost the original pictorial quality was because they passed through the hands of a people opposed to graven images! We have other scripts that began as pictorial images which also later became abstract shapes where no such reason could involved. The explanation is redundant.  Such special pleading is disturbing.  Ouaknin mangles the pronunciations of the characters. What kind of professor and teacher specializing in Hebrew and Jewish studies doesn't know that the sounds of modern Hebrew and modern Greek were not always the same as the sounds of their ancient counterparts (and in the case of Hebrew not the same as the Hebrew used by Jews who have continued to dwell in Arabic countries for centuries).  Every time a character's modern pronunciation differs from an older pronunciation Ouaknin gets it wrong.  One example of many: in his discussion on F Ouknin explains that the letter vav is pronounced as v. In fact in ancient texts it was pronounced w and the letter should probably be called waw in those contexts.  Then Ouaknin compounds his error by claiming the diagamma character which came from waw in Greek was also pronounced v. It wasn't.  Yet two paragraphs later (correctly but in contradiction) Ouaknin mentions that there was no "v" sound in ancient Greek. (Does he not read what he himself writes? Is he just copying material he doesn't understand?)  Also in an aside here Ouaknin mentions the introduction of the new Greek letter phi which he claims was pronounced like "f". In fact in Classical Greek the letter phi was pronounced like p followed by h.  Not only are many of the pronunciations wrong but also the diacritics on some of the tables, especially the table for Ugaritic.  On page 106 the five addtional Greek letters are given instead as four and identified as "Y, then F, X, and finally W". Seemingly F here means Phi, Psi has been forgotten altogether, and W is an error of Omega. Is the writer of this passage who apparently doesn't know the Greek alphabet the same who covers Greek epigraphy elsewhere in the book?  On page 267 though the letter O is being discussed the inscriptions have instead the letter theta rendered in red.  The book feels as though it might have been expanded from a draft originally intended to treat mainly the Hebrew alphabet. Ouaknin carefully and consistantly matches up Hebrew letters to Latin letters as much as he can and for Latin letters which contain no match Ouaknin refers the reader to a Latin letter which he considers to be the main match.  Y is listed three times in the book. The last reference which is the place where a reader would naturally look for it wrongly refers the reader to the section on K. Y is actually officially mentioned under I where it wrongly said to derive from Hebrew Yod rather than Wav/Waw. But Y also appears under F under the name  "Greek I" presumably a translation error from the original French as the French word for Y is I-Grec 'Greek I'.  I will stop pointing out such confusions now. But there are others.  Ouaknin also includes discussion of meanings of the letters, based on their original forms and on their names and on who knows what. Sometimes he mentions the Kabalah but not often. For the letter resh (R) he obtains further derived meanings by replace aleph in the three letter root Resh-aleph-shin and yet further meanings by replacing aleph instead by yod, presumably because these substitutions make no difference in modern standard Israeli Hebrew pronunciation.  It's as bad as equating English _through_ with _threw_. It is just crank linguistics.  And that leads to the final short section in the book pretentiously explaining the new concept of archaeography which is what Ouaknin is really interested in, mystical divination based on the meanings he ascribes to words in languages spelled with the proto-Sinaitic forms of the alphabet according to his equations of forms.  Yet another New Age mystical system 
 I have found that most tribute albums are lame and why not just listen to the original.  So when I first heard about the project of a tribute to Grover Washington ,  I thought how do you cover God, because Grover was like a God to contemporary jazz.  WOW! What an album! OK, nobody had to write any songs on this, but they all put their own spin on each song and did a fabulous job.  Jason Miles produced this fresh off two grammy nominees for his 2000 release tribute CD to Ivan Lins ( Sting won for his version of "She Walks This Earth" while Grover was nominateed for "Cameleo " ).  First the lineup is just stellar: Regina Belle , Gerald Albright, Russ Freeman, Ronnie Laws with Sounds Of Blackness, Herbie Mann, Tom Schuman and Jeff Mironov, Dave Koz, Everette Harp, Steve Cole, George Duke, Mark Whitfield, Richard Elliot, Jay Beckenstein with Dean Brown, Paul Taylor with Peter White, Chuck Loeb with Dave Mann, Chaka Khan, Greg Philinganes with the New York Philharmonic String Section, and Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Joe Sample with Joey Defrancesco.  If you'd pick up an album with all of these guys on it and it wasn't all Grover tunes you'd buy it! In fact you'd probably have a huge grin on your face and tell half the store about your lucky find on the way to the cash register. So now imagine all these guys playing their version of all these great Grover tunes like: "Just The Two Of Us" , "Winelight", " East River Drive" , "Inner City Blues ", " Come Morning " , " Let It Flow" and more.  I can see you smiling and saying yeah I'd buy it and you should. " To Grover , With Love " is magnificent . It's good. It's great.  It's deadly gorgeous !!   
 I found after reading the first part of this book i became very depressed.  I had to stop reading it because it made me feel very helpless 
 articles weren't anything new. mostly fluff and cosmetic/clothes ads. better info and exercises in Oxygen and Women's M&F. 
 I don't have anything against gay people, but this album makes me feel borderline homosexual. I like to think of myself as a pretty straight guy, but I can't feel this way when the whole album sounds like one long vogue commercial. Not once did I hear a good dance beat or anything that could be called a decent romantic song. I could have enjoyed this album more if barney himself sang the songs. Michael needs to retire and stop living in the 80's. He has a good voice but not good enough to save all the corny lyrics and yester-year dance beats.  Save your money and don't waste it on this garbage. 
 Tommy, what were you thinking?  Although they are lovely to look at, they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe, bar none.  The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk, I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem, I was wrong.  Take this design back to the drawing board and start again.  
 Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic 
 Absolutely superb album!!! I haven't stopped playing it for the last 3 days and I am quite fussy with what I like. All the tracks for this album are wonderful and just carry you away with emotion. Fantastic peice! 
 Wow--what a downer.  We watched three unlikeable characters spiral downward into an abyss of hopelessness and despair for over two hours, and it wasn't worth it in the end.  There's no redemption here, no hope of change, no learning on the part of any character.  I'd say more, but there really isn't much more to tell.  I'd never consider watching this film again, and I would recommend it to no one 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 I recently watched this movie, what a piece of garbage.  I thought Wood Harris was plain awful...downright painful to watch as Hendrix.  I was sick of his darting tongue and  his constant cheezy grinning during the concert scenes. The guitar playing " simulation "was even worse. The real Hendrix was not like this at all!!!.  I should have suspected the movie would suck, because no one can cheapen a film like Billy Zane.  Once I recognized him behind that huge mustache, I should have stopped watching.  I blame this one though, on Wood Harris..he was just terrible 
 Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series.  As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really "jumps the shark", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the "corrupt rich guy" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space.  Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead 
 First, I'd like to say that I am a big fan of both Andre Norton and Mercedes Lackey.  That said, this isn't one of their better works. I picked this up for reading over vacation as I had seen the book in print for a number of years and thought I would give it a try.  My problem with the book, is that the characters aren't very engaging.  I've only read this first of 3 (4?) books, and I doubt I will continue simply because I found that I do not care about the well being of the heroes or the destruction of the villans.  This is definitely a "light reading" novel 
 This book is filled with lot's of 'hunko-macho' street talk. Too much descriptons of 'Rambo-hero' scenerios. This is definitely NOT a step-by-step instruction manual with accompanying illustrations. Read other authors if you are looking for more serious stuffs 
 For as beautiful and heartwarming as is The Road from Coorain, True North  is a pure disappointment. A good writer can make any subject a delight, but  Ms. Ker-Conway is not a writer, at least in this offering. Yes, she is in  total demand of her language but in True North she does not write from the  heart, she writes like a text-book author rather than as a story teller.  Fine if that is her intent, but she, and her publisher, should not try to  pass it off as an invigorating read. Further, her contradictory use of  sexism is disturbing. On one hand she condemns the male dominated world of  her era for their blatant discrimination of women, but on the other she  unabashedly uses her gender as a basis for the hiring of colleages. As a  highly educted historian it appears that history has taught her nothing.  She is repeating and coninuing a clearly defined mistake of our society. I  read Road From Coorain to learn more of my own mothers childhood, she is  also Australian from the same generation as Ms. Ker-Conway. My mother was  raised in poverty and had little oppurtunity for higher education. Yet  despite the lack of a formal education, my mother is very well read and has  a keen mind. Alert, inquisitive, always open to new thoughts and ideas. In  comparison, I sense that Ms. Ker-Conway has closed her mind to much of the  world, at least the uneducated world. If nothing else she comes across as  an educated snob, an elitist. A common delemna to a genius mind. Road from  Coorain is a delight. True North is a true bore 
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 The writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense.  I thought something might change, that it might become an interesting ghost story, or there might be moral issues, or maybe even a character would grow or change.  The heavy-handed ending is, perhaps, intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in Amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones...but that's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness.  Are we supposed to take everything that Ellie says about the Amish in court (peaceful, gentle, incapable of murder, loving, child-centric, willing to accept an out-of-wedlock child into the community) as lies?  The ending belongs to a much darker book.  My biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing, I kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story.  
 A biography about a boy - and a very tough and brave one - who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors (or killed and maimed) of Iwo experienced. He saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice. By strict definition, this act was deserving of the Medal of Honor. His terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching, but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of Iwo veterans, or any other battle, I have read. The other accounts I have read generally conclude: War is a horrible thing to experience, and not glorious, but "I would do it again.........". The recent books I have read will illustrate this contrast: "GOODBYE, DARKNESS", William Manchester "GOD IS NOT HERE.....", Richard Overton "THE QUIET HERO", Gary W. Toyn "FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS", James Bradley "THE LAST LIEUTENANT", John Shively These men may have entered combat as boys, but they certainly left as men.  
 I think I expected this book to discuss the concept of mourning  and memory more but it also discussed friendship with the inclusion of letters and poems. I cannot say that I disliked this book but its cover lead me to believe it was going to be a different focus 
 I do respect what they are trying to do in this movie, but it doesn't come to fruition in my opinion. It is definitely true that you will have to watch it at least twice to get it all, but I am not sure you will want to after the first viewing....I didn't. This is a movie that had great potential, but in my opinion it never reached it. You may disagree.  I don't mind depth and intricacy in a movie plot, or even a little misdirection in order to keep it exciting (e.g. Sixth Sense), but I do mind confusion. And it was not just confusing, in the end, despite a nice attempt and maybe a few moments of drama, to me it was just plain boring. Alot of my boredom may just be attributable to the minimalist approach to this whole movie, nevertheless, it bored me. It relied to heavily on the story and the acting, neither of which were bad, but not nearly good enough to make up for the lack of visual interest in this movie.   
 This book, this so called scientific social book, is a tower constructed by lies and half truths based upon the author's (and the liberal media's) hatred toward Christians.  There is no such thing as a war against science by Republicans and the Christians.  There IS such a thing as a war against God, very easily  seen in such "I hate Christians" books like this one, but that is to be considered later on.  Basically, this book is a 342 page book founded upon Christianphobia.  It is a witch hunter's book that tries to demean and belittle and lie about Christians.  I will make this brief, but specific on two examples.  1) Darwinism and 2) Abortion and Stem-Cell Research.    Why do I feel the need to stand up against the idea of teaching children about Evolution?  Why do I want to stand up against the humanistic agenda of destroying the minds and souls of our children?  Why do I feel the need to push for the consideration of Intelligent Design to be offered toward these same children?  Because evolution is false.  Evolution is not true.  Evolution holds no solid ground.  Have I studied evolution?  Yes.  Before becoming a Christian I was an outspoken apostle of Evolution until I was shown the facts and the facts are this...evolution is a fallacy and the only reason why Evolution is being so championed in the class rooms is because the humanist/liberal hate Christians.  They call us anti-intellectuals, strangely enough, and  yet the driving force of the liberal party is a paranoid dilution driven hatred toward Christians.  Here are some authors and their titles that I challenge you with:  Ralph Muncaster's Dismantling Evolution; Phillip Johnson's Darwin on Trial; David Snoke's A Biblical Case for an Old Earth; and finally, Fazale Rana and Hugh Ross' Who was Adam.    Then there is abortion.  What is so scientific about abortion?  You kill a child.  Simple.  Why should the scientific community care so much about abortion?  Because they do not understand the concept of human rights (their human rights are rights that go along with whatever the PC pop culture has to say this week).  Stem-Cell research is a tag along on the abortion supporting train because these so called scientists want you the reader to think that if the two do not go together then all these people will die a painful death if Stem-Cell research is not provided.  Abortion in itself is murder.  Simple as that.  You murder a child.  A child with a mind, a child with a heart, and a child with a soul.  That is not emotional blackmail toward women, that is just the simple truth.  And Stem-Cell research?  You do not have to harvest embryos like some scientist and politician out of Brave New World.  There are far better ways, far safer way, to study Stem-Cell and how it may or may not help those who are in need.  I suggest you read works such as ProLife Answers to ProChoice Arguments by Randy Alcorn    There is no Republican war against science.  There are many scientists like David Snoke and Hugh Ross that stand up and support the truth that comes, from the very heart of the matter, from the Bible.  Republicans and Christians do not long for some "Dark Age" of society.  They, we, I, want the truth to be shown in society away from the liberal bewitching Christianphobic fanaticism that comes from those like Sam Harris and Chris Mooney 
 Middle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe.  When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status.  (But at least she's still got the money!)  Actually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it's hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they're impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazer's insistence on using Gracie's name as much as possible.  For example:  "Gracie thought about it; they'd never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning.  Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife" (p 38).  I lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up.  It's very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published.  Definitely not worth your time 
 Call me a weirdo, but I actually like listening to Earth's "Earth 2" for pleasure - and I think Sunn did too, which is why they recorded the "Grimmrobe Demos". They've got bored of this now, and are piling stuff on the drone. I've only heard one track off their next release "00 Void", and it was like getting sat on by an elephant. "Flight of the Behemoth"'s BOW 1 is just horrible, and Julian Cope on "White 1" is laughable. Now "White 2" starts with Helloween, brilliant "old skool" drone, really nicely done and worth the cost of the CD alone, but this is followed by "Bass Aliens", which I can't believe anyone listens to for pleasure. It's okay as background music with the volume down to near zero, which I believe is a problem. It's followed by "Decay "2 which is really cheesy panto black metal drone fusion. It's fun as a one-off though, and the chanting vocals are good.  Now unfortunately Sunn obvously thought it was a very good idea, and they've released a whole album of this rubbish -"Black One". I grew up listening to the likes of Slayer, and I saw millions of thrash bands at the Edinurgh Venue in the early 90s - so I'm a metal fan. But this nonsense - it's really cheesy. If you like your drone to be spooky and screechy with scary samples and vocals, it's for YOU.  In fact, it not even drone - it's ultra-heavy black metal made as unpleasant as possible. But rather than being hardcore, almost the opposite is true - its seems to be both posturing to the metal crowd and providing the journalists with something easy to write about   I hope Sunn do a U-turn in their following releases and get the purity back 
 After the hype on this book, I was extremely disappointed at how it rambled along with extraneous detail that never made a cohesive whole. I kept at it, hoping it would improve but alas, dear reader it does not. 
 I love the other disturbed albums-this one though is somthing of a letdown. with the exeption of "liberate" its the same tune from begining to end.   Not great.   I love ten thousand fists though that whole album is teriffic 
 I am baffled at how country music stations and fans of the horrible music can stand hearing Lonestar's "Mr. Mom" over and over again everyday. The song is as stupid as it is annoying, and the lyircs are extremely juvenile. Who had the horrible idea of writing a song about stay at home mothers? Lonestar, the manwomen of country. But what's worse is that Nashville and country radio declared it a hit and decided to play it 25 times per day. (And I thought that Tim McGraw's "Back When" was as bad as it could get)  Let's take a look at a few of the hillariously idiotic lyrics from this song:   "Football, soccer and ballet Squeeze in Scouts and PTA And there's that shopping list she left That's seven pages long How much smoke can one stove make The kids won't eat my charcoal cake It's more than any maid can take Being Mr. Mom  Well Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer Crayons go up one drawer higher Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time Breakfast, six naps at nine There's bubble gum in the baby's hair Sweet potatoes(they pronounce it PER-TAT-ERS) in my lazy chair Been crazy all day long and it's only Monday Mr. Mom"  I should seriously consider becoming a country artist. I can make my voice sound like a male country singer and I can write meaningless whitetrash songs, so all I have to do now is find someone to play steel guitar for me, and i'm gonna make it big as a star in Nashville and all over redneck USA. If you want to hear good country, stay with classics like Johnny Cash and Conway Twitty. Please pass on girly garbage and mindless hick mumbling 
 I generally really like well-researched historical fiction, and have been a big fan of Dorothy Dunnett and Philippa Gregory (though the latter takes a lot of liberties with history).  I was quite drawn into this book from the first sentence, and found the description of life on the manor rich and convincing.  But.  began to switch off around the time we discover Jacob Cullen is possessed?  haunted?  by a "Voice" that encouraged him to brutally kill a young boy, and then rape his new bride.  Jacob ends up in the New Model Army where he forms an intense relationship with Ferris, who is a naturally good man.  The descriptions of the war and the brutality are vivid and detailed.    After they get back to London, Ferris becomes obsessed with forming a common plot for "diggers," and he and Jacob form an intense homosexual romance.  At that point and for the rest of the book everything was rather overheated and lusty.  It seemed like every other page was a description of longing for the embrace or the sweetness between their legs etc.  I would have been equally bored if this had been a heterosexual couple, but I couldn't connect this simpering Ferris with the earlier Ferris, and Jacob's bouts of violence began to bore me.  The book ends when they've been kicked off the common brutally by the neighboring lord, with the implication that Jacob could have stopped it but just didn't, and Jacob is on a boat to America crying. The Voice is silent.   I feel as though I didn't get it. A number of readers here assume the Voice is a symptom of Jacob's schizophrenia or madness, but it's presented in the book as though it really is the devil.  Well, which? Did Jacob rape his own brother when he was a teenager, as implied in one scene?  I kind of resented the way the author withheled information from us-- it's first-person narration, but the author only conveniently reveals/remembers these types of things, when for the first 70-80 pages of the book, Jacob is presented as well-liked and decent.  It just seemed flashy.  The book's change in focus and tone felt somewhat ad hoc.      Lots of loose threads with Jacob's family.  Ultimately, I was disappointed.  After zooming through the first half, I just naturally slowed down and took a week to read the rest.  By then I was cottoning on that the author was never going to reveal the mysteries, that no one plot was going to develop in a satisfying way, and that she enjoyed vivid descriptions of violence and sex but not deeper characterizations.  She can definitely bring a period to life, but the characters were ultimately shadowy and the storytelling was disjointed 
 	`Dead Serious' is all that backs up Tuck Everlasting. If you're a person who likes a good action or comedy movie you'll drop dead after you see this movie. It's no `Rush Hour' or ` Slap shot'. It's more like your classical ` Black Beauty', but if you're that kind of person then it is highly recommended. It has the idea of life and death. It's about a normal family who was going to settle in and they stop at a spring to refresh themselves with a bit of cool water, but the spring has a curse. Who ever takes a drink from the spring has everlasting life. For me the only expressive scenes were the start and the end of the movie. You know those Oreo cookies and the icing in the middle? Well the icing in my Oreo cookie has no icing in the it just like Tuck Everlastings middle part of the movie. This movie won't entertain any teenagers. There goes three of my rotten tomatoes. 
 I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall).  Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film.  Then I noticed the cover.  I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'.  YIKES!  It is!  I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!).  If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it.  Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy 
 Like other reviewers, I bought this book based on Amazon's 'if you like David Sedaris,...'  Wrong!  Rakoff depressed and bored me.  I read most books in 2 to 3 days, but it took me two weeks to get through Fraud.  Sedaris made me laugh out loud - I never even cracked a smile with this guy.  Some of the stories could be really interesting, but he takes the fun out of a dry sense of humor 
 I have bought 5 of these crappy pads and all 5 stopped working after a short period.  Buy the Sunbeam 902 Flexible heating pad--much more reliable and useful too 
 NOFX is probably the most shamelessly sold out punk band EVER.  Fat Mike thinks his opinion is law, and quite frankly, I'm sick of it.  What happened to the good ol' days, when they were ACTUALLY FUNNY?  I mean, is this record a joke!?!??  Yeah, and um, NOFX isn't the funniest band ever.  In fact, this WON'T give them a song idea.  NOFX has no ideas.  They are just jumping on the political and religious bandwagon to sell more records.  Honestly, I don't care what NOFX says anymore.  All I hear is a bunch of whiners going "Blah, blah, blah..."    Oh, P.S.  If you want a REAL funny song by a punk band that actually has their own ideas, check out GREEN DAY's "Dominated Love Slave" off of Kerplunk 
 This book was crazy and all over the place.  I would not recommend this book to anyone it was far to unrealistic.  The mother went from normal and sane Mother to crazy pysho killer mother in a couple pages 
 John R. Barry (another Digital Communications textbook author) first introduced me to this text.  And Mr. Barry, as with many com. theory persons I've met since (GTRI in Atlanta, GA; MITRE along around the Boston area of MA; Northrup in El Segundo, CA; Intersil in Palm Bay/Melbourne, FL) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs.  Essentially, it's their Bible.  The only problem is that the values and beliefs in Proakis, especially from an engineering perspective, are very third rate.  Trying to use this text in a classroom situation, especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor, is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective.  John R. Barry, for example, is a very good baby-sitter and a so-so mathematician (he couldn't be otherwise as a faculty member of Georgia Tech).  But as an engineer, John R. Barry, as with the other followers of Proakis, compares very unfavorably (in fact, I don't consider Barry an engineer; I consider him a phony that should be removed from the ECE faculty of GATECH; the department's economic fortunes would be far better if he were moved into some kind of adjunct English/Mathematics Faculty or just shipped off to some research laboratory without any students to harm [i.e., vampirically mind f--k them and then kindly provide them with werewolfic deliverance (yes, I mean along the lines of the 1972 movie with Jon Voight [Angelina Jolie's Dad] and Burt Reynolds)]...any place where truth/reality aren't so important).  There are far, far better communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [infinitely better to be precise].  And what makes these others better [others meaning real engineers; John R. Barry being a make-believe "engineer"] is not mathematical ability, memorized knowledge, or even rhetorical shrewdness, but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility.    In fact, the values and beliefs in the Proakis text seem to promulgate not only  Intellectual Abuse, but also a Spiritual sort as well. In a nation (where Steven Pinker, who like Proakis is of Harvard Fame, has noted) that has around 75% of its population esentially believing in the biblical/torah-related account of things, this kind of Spiritual abuse can be very dangerous indeed and lead to serious consequences.  Though it may not be intentional, nevertheless, the values and beliefs of Proakis's text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually abusive.  These values and these beliefs somehow set up a massive cognative dissonance with many student's own biblical/torah-related values and beliefs.  The result is almost always a broken-spirit.  From an economic perspective, this is bad. Very bad. And it should be stopped by no longer using this text or any like it.  Most of the "engineers" now being "developed" by the followers of Proakis (e.g., John R. Barry) are very analogous to Mid 20th Century Carribean medical school "doctors."  They can say, write, and use a lot of terminology making them useful for billing purposes, i.e. writing up invoices to Insurance/Government agencies.  These "engineers" like those "doctors" don't and probably never will understand the essence of their professions, though because of their training or lack thereof they really think they do.  When in fact, they are utterly clueless "professionals. 
 I hated this book.  This family has two girls, Racie and Jaynell.  Rachie is a girly-girl and Jaynell is a tomboy.  It seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  Her parents are just plain crazy.  Mama repedily whipped Racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to "tear up" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  Once Jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. Then Jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on Racie.  Her parents are just crazy.  Then grandpa dies.  Dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  I understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  Children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  Racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  Jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  These people were crazy.  This book is crazy 
 The good thing first: Classical baby has very nice animations and the music choosen is nice too. BUT, it is very short and it does not contain any extras, there is just the animations nothing more. The package says something about a parents guide but thats just a small booklet inside thats really just an advertisement. I was hoping that some real instruments appear and people showing how to play them, as an extra this would be very useful. Well, I am disappointed by this DVD! And my kids (4 y. and 17 m.) too, they looked it one time - nearly, and dont want it any more 
 Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book.  I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.  In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.  I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so.  This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined.  Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts.  Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired 
 This short little book contains three essays that move from the exoterically esoteric to the downright incomprehensible.  Like Kabbalah itself is often assumed to be, Bloom's thinking is like a Gnostic nugget - albeit without the imaginative cosmology that Gnosticism historically had - where the first essay is like the outside of the pomegranate, the second essay like the layer around the pomegranate and the third essay the actual fruit.  Kabbalah and Criticism is set within a Scholem-esque historiography but with one thing missing: the Messiah which, in Bloom's work, never appears - indeed, one can wonder whether or not the Messiah is ever coming at all!  The actual fruit turns out to be empty and emptying; rather than taking us anywhere, Kabbalah and Criticism simply leaves the reader hanging.  The first essay is an explanation of the major themes in Jewish mysticism/Kabbalah, focusing primarily on its Zoharic (13th century) and Lurianic (15th & 16th century) manifestations.  Kabbalah is usually considered fairly esoteric; ironically, this essay is the most exoteric in the entire book.  It is clear that Bloom has digested the writings of Gershom Scholem - the brilliant mind who first brought Jewish mysticism into academic credibility in the 20th century - and it is from within this Scholem-esque framework that Bloom operates.  In the second essay, however, Kabbalah is clearly shown to not actually be a map of the world, but a type of two-dimensional signifier in which the various interactions between the the Ten Sefirot exist not as signifiers pointing to the reality of God, but as signifiers pointing to the fact that texts themselves interact with each other and that the interaction is not found first and foremost in the texts or the Sefirot, but in the space between them.  Thus Kabbalah, rather than speaking of God, becomes a springboard for a literary theory.  Why it is that Kabbalah ought to be this springboard is never explained; given the commodification of all things Kabbalistic today, it seems that Bloom is no different, for Kabbalah is entirely unnecessary for his theory - it's just a useful heuristic, and nothing more.  The heuristic, furthermore, never actually serves to take the reader to any point of understanding.  Thus, for Bloom, Kabbalah is a series of symbols that interact within one another ad infinitum but because they are never anything more than that, nothing ever arrives in Kabbalah any more than in any text.  In short, Bloom's theory is entirely devoid of a Messiah: just as the symbols symbolize unendingly in Bloom's Kabbalistic maze (something that Scholem would have found quite hard to accept), so too does the text itself continually exist in need of re-reading - or, as Bloom prefers, *mis-reading*.  Literature is a series of misreadings, a confusion of interpretation with text by insisting that all interpretation *is* the text that is being interpreted.  By the time Bloom gets to this essay, he is so far from the Jewish mysticism that he began with that it becomes quite clear that Kabbalah is really quite superfluous to his whole theory.  He *mis-reads* Kabbalah and, in doing so, is only capable of arguing that interpretation - mis-reading - justifies itself.  If one is interested in Harold Bloom, the back of this book claims that "Kabbalah and Criticism may justly be regarded as the cardinal work in Harold Bloom's enterprise."  I honestly can't understand why anyone would bother, though, for its Kabbalism is vacuous and its criticism vapid.  Bloom is a brilliant guy, but because his Kabbalism lacks the possibility of a Messiah - a reading in which the text and the reader meet in a moment of deep meaning - Kabbalah and Criticism simply wanders in a desert of thin symbols lifted out of their historical context and it therefore begins to look not just like the Messiah will never come, but that there is no historical world for him to even come to 
 I am really not able to understand what is this cheap kind of strategy not to provide USB cable with this product, especially when thats the only interface available technically? Can someone make me understand the logic (business sense) behind this, especially for a Canon like brand!!??? Definitely, consumers expect much better from Canon. "Canon", please bring better business sense to market that would help end users/consumers. Thanks 
 I don't know what the last poster was thinking... This DVD goes to the top of my worst quality list. I wouldn't complain as much but they are advertized as "Digitally Remastered," which is obviously meaningless. "Long John Silver" is soft-focus, borderline blurry, throughout; marred with constant flecks and blobs; and has countless vertical scratches that score the full image. It's like watching some old home movie you found in a trunk. Haven't viewed "Captain Kidd," but a cursory scan indicated it too is in poor condition. If that's the best the films come, and there's no money for clean-up, so be it. But get that misleading "Digitally Remastered" off the box. That's a hoodwink if ever there was one 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 This is a total waste of your time, IMHO. You know you are going to get three page chapters and lots of white space, but Parker usually manages to tell you a story and often quite well. Not this time.  Spencer meanders around and around while everyone lies to him about what he is investigating, he and Susuan have some snappy chat, he and Hawke much less so and then the book is over in a very forced and unsatisfying way. You wait and wait for the story to pick up and get interesting, but it never does.   Pass on this one 
 Having a novel's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre.  When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened.  When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions.  When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming.    In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed.   Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying.  My question to Mr. Patterson is:  If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first ï¿½ of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end?  Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)?  I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters.  Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel.   My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense.  For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows.  Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing.  This is ridiculous.  Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find.  How else do people buy drugs from them?  It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames.    Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal.  It doesn't make sense.  Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality.  Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid. 
 Pleasant movie but nothing special, a very ordinary story. Audrey Hepburn's charisma is what puts some life to the movie. Some subtle humour though 
  Book arrived with more than the stated "edge wear". It was missing pages and the spine of the "trade paperback graphic novel" is broken and loose. This should have been listed in the details of Book condition. Used but not abused is what I thought I purchased. Sad 
 I bought Elizabeth Aston's Mr. Darcy's Daughters and  The Exploits and Adventures of Miss Alethea Darcy at an used bookstore at the same time and so I had no choice but to give them a whirl.  I didn't like Mr. Darcy's Daughters so I had no big expectations with this one.  I don't know if my not expecting much had actually made this book a little more enjoyable than its predecessor, but it was.  This one picks up where the fist installment left off.  Alethea Darcy, the Darcys' youngest daughter is miserable.  Her unhappy marriage to the controlling Mr. Norris Napier, whom she married after the love of her life marries someone else and leaves on the verge of ruin, has left her no choice but to run as far away from him as possible.  Alethea and her personal maid dress up as men in order to avoid being recognized as they travel to Italy.  She wants to be with her sister Camilla, the one person she has always confided in.  But on her way to Venice, she encounters several obstacles, one in particular in the form of  Mr. Titus Manningtree.  Titus cannot believe the woman's boldness and improper behavior, but he is also smitten by her wit and spirit.  Feelings ensue between these two characters, but will Alethea ever be free from her husband?  There are some twists throughout the novel.  Elizabeth Aston is no Jane Austen.  I have known that since reading the first installment of this series.  As said earlier, I was unimpressed with the first novel and thought that the five daughters were almost exact replicas of the Bennett sisters.  And the whole thing centered on improper behavior and ruined reputations appalled me because Jane Austen would have never written something like that.  Having said that, The Exploits and Adventures of Miss Alethea Darcy was more enjoyable because Aston created some rather compelling situations this time that didn't sound like a bad copy of a Jane Austen novel.  It is also a relief that most Pride and Prejudice characters don't appear much here (and the appearances and mentions of P&P characters include Mr. Collins, who is as annoying as ever).  Alethea Darcy is an interesting heroine.  Out of the five women Aston created in the first book, she is the most interesting and I'm glad that the author decided to do a spinoff with her.  Titus is also compelling.  However, the reason for his European trip (to try to find his father's Titian painting) is just a contrived plot device to put these two characters together.  The fact that the painting isn't mentioned again proves this theory.   As for the novel in general, I suppose that the main reason why I liked this one a little more was because I was able to suspend the fact that these characters are based on the beloved Pride and Prejudice.  I read this as a standalone novel and not as part of a sequel of the aforementioned classic.  I had to do it so that I wouldn't throw the book against the wall.  There are, after all, things here that Austen would never have written about.  And there were still things that puzzled me.  The historical accuracy here is questionable.  Some things just don't ring true for that era.  Homosexuality and sexual things in general are discussed a little too openly.  That was unheard of in Regency England.  There were other things that annoyed me because I wasn't sure if they were true to the period or not and they pulled me out of the story again and again.  All in all, The Exploits and Adventures of Miss Alethea Darcy is a better read than Mr. Darcy's Daughters.  However, it is nevertheless far from being perfect, which is why I give it two and a half stars 
 This slender paperback has a lot to offer in the food category, which is the main point.  The recipes were more gourmet and ethnic than I expected, with a lot of new dishes.  Even if you choose not to cook them in a tabletop/toastr oven, they're nice to have around for only 1-4 servings.  As for the books toaster-friendly side, I'm not so sure.  The authors give few special techniques or safety tips, a must for an appliance notorious for being a fire hazard.  Also, most small toaster ovens are hell to clean, making it questionable whether you'd want to broil a lot of greasey things like hamburgers in them 
 I was forced to read this book in English class and it is terrible! If you want a book that will put you to sleep at night, this is the one. I dissliked this book because it seems that it is not even supposed to be entertaining! 
 This book could be useful for a serious etymologyst, but it is very difficult to decifer unless you are willing to spend hours learning all of the abbreviations. It is organized like a dictionary.  The entries give the current dictionary definition of each word, and then proceed to trace the evolution of the word.  This evolution is often difficult to understand because of the previously mentioned abbreviations.  This book is for a dedicated linguist, or someone with much patience and tim 
 Ok I started reading. It was pretty interesting. Until the middle. It was kinda confusing. There were too many characters. I read back through and got it. Next, I find out the main character's brother is a killer who never get sin trouble and who's parents don't care. The reason Paul has glasses is because his brother Erik sprayed white paint into his eyes. Nice huh? And of course, his parents keep all of this a secret, telling him he looked up at the sun during an eclipse. Paul is good at soccer, so his parents care? NO. All they care about is Erik's football career. It was depressing. Then Erik steals $1,000s of dollars worth of stuff and is responsible for two murders. Guess what? His parents don't punish him! Paul finally tells the Sheriff the stuff Erik did, and finally, Erik is caught and arrested. I was disappointed, they didn't tell what kind of punishment the jerk got. The parents still don't seem to care. How abusive?! The summary seems to make it seem like a happy and silly type of book. Well, it's not. It's dark, and evil. Don't read this if you hate violence, or are under 9. I could handle it just fine because I'm a mature 11 yr. old. It may deeply disturb and depress some younger children though 
 "If you tell a joke and it isn't funny and you put a laugh track under it it still isn't going to be funny." -Robin Williams (as Tom Dobbs in Man of the Year)  In a momentary lapse of judgement I rented this from a redbox. I knew  with Robin Williams as the lead that I was taking a risk but I thought that the prescence of Chris Walken could maybe redeem the movie. Besides I figured even if it wasn't that great it would only be a dollar investment. Today I sit in quiet reflection over what i must boldly state is the worst movie ever. I watched this with some friends and never once during the movie did I hear the sounds of laughter. Just uncomfortable, embarassed, awkward silence as Tom Dobbs (Williams) threw out zinger after zinger, perhaps hoping that the sheer volume of terrible jokes could compensate for the incoherent story line. But it was all in vain. Much to my dismay the movie actually continued after the election and turned into a "thriller" about a big business trying to kill an employee with a shocking secret. Now let me tell you a secret, this movie is not funny and not thrilling it's just old fashioned terrible 
 People like bunker2k1 sicken me, talking about peace and then turning around and saying how much he enjoys Burning books. The fact is that the Acult is no different then most other religions. Christianity its self is the largest Acult. So before you start preaching about peace and Jesus Why don't you look into the history of Christianity. You will then see the Purest of all evil. Wonder why its the most excepted religion? Lets see because The Christian faith was a plague across the land killing entire villages of people and converting all it can. You where told to drop your faith and except Christ. This is the reason today it is where it is. Not because of love or peace but with murder,hate and the idea of having everyone believe in the same thing. If you look at history where do you see devil worshippers or witches even killing 1% of the people that Christians, catholics do. they don't, its a fear tactic to make people believe their is a "DEVIL" Around every corner to keep people believing in the lie. So you can Pray to your GOD of false LOVE believing their is a devil and the acult is out their waiting to take you and your children, Or you can open your eyes do some research and you will find out Christian based religions are the Acult you place so much fear into 
 This book has no real facts and makes outstandingly stupid claims that have no basis in reality, a real waste of my time 
 Most of this book seems to focus on the "adult" video industry, with a hefty portion of wife swapping thrown in.  The former is pretty much a LA industry, and the latter is more of a realm for perverted hobbyists than part of the Las Vegas sex business.  The book cruises along for quite a while before getting to the meat and potatoes of prostitution and "gentlemen's clubs" in Vegas.  Those parts of the book at least have some interest, but the author wastes too much paper, ink and readers' time on the personal history of each and every stripper, hooker, and wannabe that he interviews.  It seems that there is much to be written about the BUSINESS of sex in Vegas, and even more about how that business is carried out, and by whom.  Sadly, this is not the book for that 
 As a general rule, any film with a large number of Roman numerals behind it is going to suck, and the eighth outing of the F-13 franchise, JASON TAKES MANHATTAN, obeys this rule to a fanatical degree. This movie is terrible, an utter embarrassment, and is noteworthy only as a study in corporate greed and marketing deception.    By the fourth installment of the series, the ironically titled FINAL CHAPTER, this formulaic slasher franchise was as exhausted as an old, blood-soaked boot. Jason Voorhees had outlived his usefulness and it was time for his rotted a*s to hang up the gaolie mask and retire. But the movie industry is an industry first, and when THE FINAL CHAPTER turned unexpectedly into a cash cow the studio execs at Paramount continued to flog their exhausted serial killer into progidies of meaningless violence. THE FINAL CHAPTER was followed by three more absolutely asinine sequels, which saw Jason improve the Crystal Lake gene pool by slaughtering legions of pot-smoking teenage dimwits. By this time P-mount was beginning to get embarrassed by their deformed, kill-crazy stepchild, yet the lure of an easy payday drew them on.   I still remember seeing the preview for this flick in a movie theater back in 1989. The audience ate it up. We actually believed that the producers had decided to tweak the exhausted series by loosing Jason in a place where he would probably feel right at home: the Big Apple. One could only imagine the bloody shennanigans Crystal Lake's least popular citizen could embark upon in New Yawk City! People were laughing out loud as they imagined him loose in the City of Lights. He could slay obnoxious Volcanoites! Teach rude cab drivers the errors of their ways! Annihilate the snotty salespeople at Tiffanys! Cut down on panhandlers! Convince grafitti artists to stay out of dark alleys! Run for mayor! We sixteen year olds LOVED the idea.  There was just one problem. The gang at Paramount had no intention of delivering on their promise. The ad campaign, like the title of the movie, was a fraud, and the only thing that got "taken" in this film was the money of a lot of bloodthirsty teenage dupes.  First of all, the first 60 minutes of this 90-odd minute movie are not set in Manhattan, but  in Crystal Lake and then on a ship called the Lazarus (get it?) which is conveying the usual cargo of teenage acting-skool dropout slasher fodder on a graduation cruise to New York. Jason, accidentally revived from the depths of the Lake by a jolt of electricity, stows on board the ship and proceeds to ch-ch-ch, ha-ha-ha his way through the doltish grads and the suspiciously small crew until the survivors are pursuaded to take a rowboat to Manhattan Island. Unfortunately "Manhattan Island", with the exception of a couple of second-unit establishing shots, is largely an unimaginative-looking soundstage on the Paramount lot populated by Central Casting New Yawkers, including the usual mixed-race mugger team and an Irish cop who says things like, "Well, ye seem loike foine peeple, so I'll not be arresting ye."   There is not a single scary moment in the whole film, and there are not even any particularly interesting kills. Kane Hodder's plodding, rotting, thoroughly over-rated Jason looks almost bored, as if he signed onto the cruise by accident, and then got talked into doing his mass murder shtick by the ship's entertainment director. To make up for the lack of any kind of suspense, the writers threw in a lot of gratuitous pleading for mercy from the female characters, and added nice little moments like a ship's crewmember talking warmly about his baby son right before Jason runs a harpoon through his body. Classy stuff, but really, everything about the movie is stupid, from the crazy deckhand who mumbles prophetically that the voyage is doomed (shades of Crazy Ralph), to the annoyingly cute little dog who has more acting talent than most of the victims. Hell, the climax of the film features a chase through the New York sewers, which, we are told, flood with radioactive toxic waste every midnight. (Does Rudy Guilani know about this?)  I realize having expectations for a Jason movie is silly, but even by the cellar-low standards of the franchise, this flick is a ripoff, a fraud, a dreadful fake, utterly stupid, appallingly bad, useless, terrible, and horrible. ZERO STARS. 
 I was disappointed like many of the previous readers, mostly having to do with non-existent character development (all clones of each other), insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans (all of whom seemed to be "ruggedly handsome"). However, I was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies. For example, if one can actually believe that non-musicians can air-guitar their way through a live performance, it doesn't explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone. Also, I find it hard to believe that their GPS was working in the depths of the sewers. Also, the cops' plan to pour dye into the sewers didn't seem like it should have worried the corporation; with a couple of hours head start, wouldn't their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye? Also, the CIA head was 33 years old in 1959, and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in WWII; pretty responsible job for someone who was 19-years old at the end of the war 
 I do not have enough negative adjectives for this charger. Echo the other reviewers regarding the sliding contacts, they barely work correctly right out of the package, consistently getting disconnected at the slightest bump. My bet is that after a year of use they don't work at all. And after a disconnect, you start the 8 hour cycle all over again. Which brings me to my second complaint. The charger works on a timer, something that is not specified on the outside of the package. This is the worst way to charge your batteries, cooking them with a full charge even if they don't need it. Get a charger that senses voltage and your expensive batteries will last a lot longer. Another thing, this charger will charge only an even number of AA/AAA batteries, something else that is not specified on the outside of the package. It has four separate charging circuits, each circuit will work only if it has two identical batteries in it (C, D, and 9 volt can be charged individually). Again, this is a very bad way to charge your batteries, especially if the two batteries have different discharge levels. And finally, the quality is very very poor. One charging circuit on my unit didn't work right out of the package. It kept showing that it had bad batteries in it, even though there were none. 
 This book was poorly written. Its plot was somewhat implausible and the characters were anything but dynamic. It seemed more like a screenplay thinly disguised as a novel, as it possessed very little literary merit. I would not recommend this book to anyone who values his or her leisure time 
 My book club strikes again with this inane, predictable and hard to complete selection.  I think Kim Edwards found the novel difficult to finish writing, because the ending was even more bland and poorly developed than the rest of the book.  The premise of the novel is interesting enough, which is why I found it mildly engaging.  However, I found myself hating all the characters in the book (save Phoebe).  The metaphors the author uses are for the most part cheap, and are further deflated by their constant repetition.  How many starfish metaphors can she make in the course of just a few paragraphs?  Then there was the overuse of several phrases..."silverfish" is just one that comes to mind.  Still, this was Kim Edward's freshman novel, so I can excuse some of the overly-elaborated and amateur metaphors; hence the two star rating.  I had a difficult time trudging through this book to reach the end.  The middle section could have been half as long and still sufficed.  The characters were all, without exception, poorly developed and painfully uninteresting.  This doesn't make the invisible plot any more tolerable.  I would say that if you really wanted to feel like you wasted your time reading something, then choose this book.  There is certainly nothing to be gained by reading it 
 Somewhere in the afterword of "The Callahan Chronicals," Robinson alludes to an SF writer who wrote a series of stories that were deliberately bad, I suppose as a sort of commentary on the literary standards of the public. The series proved popular. After reading this note, I wondered for a few days what the series could be. Then, duh, it struck me. Robinson is, of course, referring to the stories in this very book. It's a reasonable joke, but not one I was happy to pay for. As for the stories themselves, if you like characters that are organic (i.e., wooden) and multidimensional-remember that one is a multiple of itself-and don't care about plots, you might like the book. Readers who prefer science fantasy to science fiction may like the book as well: most non-human characters are unique, freeing Robinson from any obligation to consider implications of the presence of different sentient species in this adolescent fantasy world. The book might also appeal to science fantasy fans who crave reassurance about how cool they are and who don't mind page after page of authors showing off how clever they are 
 What is this a teaching text or a political commentary?   What professor would recommend such an awful book to their students!  I thought it was just me until I read what other people thought and I agree 
 The M-Audio Revolution 7.1 is listed as being Mac compatible but with all the issues it has currently, I am not sure how that is true.  I own a G4 Mirrored Drive Tower and have had nothing but problems with this sound card. Currently there is still no driver for anything past 10.4.6 and if you upgrade any higher the card will not work in Surround Sound. Besides that there is constant speaker popping and horrible buzzing and squeals when switching between programs, sometimes even when the computer is not in use. It has been flakey with surround sound when using DVD Player and Quicktime, as well. During the 10% of times it works without a hassle the sound is great through my Logitech speakers, so it is quite sad when it doesn't work. It seems that this is the only option for Mac users to achieve surround sound that I know of, which is also very saddening.  I have a feeling I will be selling this to a PC user in the near future and just settling for good ol'stereo 
 This is one of the most disappointing book of short stories I have read in a long time.  The characters are shallow, boring and forgettable.  The book has a section called "Three Stories", describing different times in the lives of the same characters.  The character development, however, was so shallow, that I didn't realize I was reading about the same people until I noticed that I was seeing the same (unusual) name, Galen, so many times. Ms. Bloom tries to add surprises to each story.  Since I couldn't identify or empathize with the characters, the surprises were just an author trying to add oomph to an otherwise dull story 
 After installing this software in to My PC. Some functions of my keyboard stopped working. Even some multimedia buttons disappeared. After that I had to concatct HP to download drivers again. Even after installing the drivers, it did not start working as beore till I uninstalled this third rate software from my PC. After uninstalling every thing got fine. I will not recommand this soft ware to any one 
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 I read this book after being directed to it by a colleague at work. It started out interesting about Carlos the under graduate student spending time with the Indian Mistic Don Juan. It seemed that Don Juan was trying to get Carlos to pierce the illusion of reality, but the story broke down quickly and just got strange and made little sense from a logical or mystical stand point. By the end of the book I started believing Carlos was being drugged and I did not trust this Don Juan. I would advise reading Vernon Howard or studying Buddhism for enlightenment and avoid this book 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 I'm just not feelin the love on this one.  The first story is ok, but kinda dull and the second is just too wordy and all this crap about incubus and imps etc.  Are all Katie Macalister books this way?  If so, I won't be a fan.  I like some vampire stuff, but if it gets too out there or detailed, I can't take it.  The third is also ok, but same thing on almost ever chapter.  Not a keeper and I wouldn't pay for it.  Good thing I got it used 
 Sorry, this guy's voice gave me the creeps. He sounds like a preacher. Who can meditate without the ability to respond positively to the  leading   voice 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 This rating dont even deserve 1 star this book sucks!!!!!!!!! Do not waste your money on this crap 
 It is American pop culture which continues the horrible trend in the United States of idolizing consumerism and placing materialistic goals and possessions in front of human beings and how they are treated individually and collectively.  He would have us believe that bands like Nirvana communicate through their music some type of hippster leftist ideal (for kids).  This coming from a music exec, an individual who on a daily basis worked in a business segment which regularly abuses the naivete of its consumers (teenagers), all in the name of making a buck (or rather, millions of them).  It's disgusting.  I'm not going to waste more time on this trash, I already feel violated after reading 2/3 of the book (at which point I admittedly gave up and moved on -- there's no way the last 1/3 was going to save it, I guarantee it) 
 This is a real electronic sounding band that has no guitar solos or good vocals. Infact they are not real good at all. All they have going for them is the lyrics, and they are getting old. They are so simular to the Hybrid theory. All of the songs sound genaric and not real fancy or hard to do. Its all in the synth. I cant say I love it, or even that its just OK. I owned it for years but I finally sold it, thank god 
 Whatever possessed Jessica Lange to appear in this mess will never be known.  The payoff at the end is a huge disappointment.  Jessica Lange tries hard to bring the material up to her level but the script does her in.  Gwyneth Paltrow is unbelievably bad.  But I think this is not their fault.  The screenplay and direction could have been better.  This could have been a very good movie along the lines of "Misery" or "Fatal Attraction" but it fails in every department.  As I said, the payoff at the end is a real disappointment.  This film is a waste of time and money.  Stay away from it!  
 The jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap-stick sight gags. I normally wouldn't have bought a movie like this but I needed it to make my Johnny Depp library complete 
 This book is written for someone with a 6th grade education and no more. It talks about magamps for pete's sake. It dosen't even broach the subject of transistors. NO TRANSISTOR THEORY!! What in sakes is electronics if not transistors! The stupid objectives at the beginning of each chapter, and the even worst review problems at the end of each chapter are simply a waste of pages. I am a former nuke electrician from the navy and a current IC Fabrication Technician in the semiconductor industry. I purchased the book to just stay up on my studies, but this book fell way short. My fiancee's daughter has learned almost everything that is covered in this book, and she is only in the 7th grade. Be forewarned, a bad book indeed 
 AWW Garth Nix I'm so disappointed :'( truly, I am. Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen were such good books but The Ragwitch was really bland. At frist I thought that it'd be really good, despite my friend saying it was going to be rubbish, and then... I read it. I couln't even finish it. I'm really sorry, I wish I didn't have to be such a kill joy but this book is really bad. I'm not going to be sour and give it a 1 but if you've read Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen then you'll know what I mean. If you havn't read thease books, then do so instead of this one because they are a hundered times better 
 It seems to me that Jon Brion has a split personality as a musician.  On one hand, he is an austere and formal composer in the classical sense (see his brilliant symphonic score for Magnolia).  And on the other hand, he is a pop magician, creating hooks within a Beatlesesque format as a producer and songwriter.  With Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jon Brion taps into the latter musical personality, and given the context of a movie score, it feels ill-suited.  The scale of a movie score requires greater complexity in the composition than Brion's pop wizardry, as superlative as it is on albums by Rhett Miller, Aimee Mann, and the like, as well as on his own solo effort, Meaningless.  Most of the pieces on this soundtrack are mere shells of pop songs albeit with some winds and strings.  The difficulty and the sense of traditional musical history that informed the greatness of the Magnolia score is all but lost on this soundtrack.  As another reviewer commented, most of the pieces are extremely short, less than two minutes.  Jon Brion clearly has the brains.  So why not show it? 
 Naturally, I was quite excited when I first heard that a new book about Hekate had been published. While there is plenty of material from academic publishers, there's really a great need for a book aimed at the Pagan audience. The book I would like to see would be written by someone with a good grasp of the primary sources and some familiarity with ancient Greek religion, and would contain suggestions for how to honor Hekate both in a traditional manner, and within the context of Wicca and other neo-Pagan religions. Let's just say that "Crossroads" ain't it.  First off, the author has not done his homework. He accuses "conventional" scholars of ignoring or misrepresenting Hekate, but the only name he mentions is Edith Hamilton. Apparently he is not familiar with the wealth of information printed in books and academic journals from the 19th century onwards, which is inexcusable since much of it is still in print, reprinted or even available online. Robert von Rudloff and Sarah Iles Johnston are listed in the bibliography, but Crowfoot has only bothered to read "Hekate Soteira", which has a rather narrow focus, while leaving out "Restless Dead" which would have been better suited to his purpose. He quotes Krauss, but only as Krauss is quoted by Iles Johnston.  As for the primary sources, Crowfoot draws much from the Theogony and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (which he mistakenly attributes to Homer). The problem is that he fails to put things in their proper context. While he often gets the basic facts right his interpretation is just as often wrong, because he lacks knowledge of ancient Greek religion and culture. For instance, Crowfoot is obviously not aware that myth and cult don't always agree. He also doesn't deal well with seemingly conflicting stories, such as those dealing with Hekate's different genealogies. Instead of realizing that different myths can illuminate different aspects of a deity's nature he attempts to create a nice, neat, picture which is just not impressive in a book that claims to be a "ground-breaking" work.  The bibliography is a joke. Crowfoot appears to work under the assumption that all sources are created equal, and as a result much of the information in "Crossroads" is taken from web pages credited to "Unknown"...  In conclusion, "Crossroads" is not historically accurate, does not present any revelations, and the claim that it should offer a correct interpretation of Hekate is outright laughable.  
 I bought this recording for my 5 & 3 year-old grandchildren who love ballet. There was nothing in the Amazon literature to indicate the homosexual slant of the production. The kids and I were half-way through viewing it when I realized what was being passed off was truly counter culture. The principal women (mom & girlfriend) were evil and stupid respectively. The "hero"s" true love was an undisguised male swan (all the swans were male). There was no hiding the passion between the male lovers. Good grief!! [... 
     I agreed with many of Salereno's points about the current self-help gurus.  They do perpetuate the need for themselves and often sham people.  However, that is about the only sane thing he has to say.      What I adamantly disagreed with was his attack on homeopathic medicine and feminism. He shamelessly blames feminism for bad education and boys' bad behavior.  Feminism is not to blame for the failure of our school systems!  There is no logical leap to be made here.  He merely twisted his words and the studies around to support his prejudices.     He also quickly discredits any use of anything outside of western medicine.  While standard medicine is important, it isn't the ONLY approach that works.  His arguments are far from fair and balanced.     Finally, for all of his complaining, Salerno offers little in the way of solutions. (Which is what College Freshman Composition 100 should have taught him)  He hints at things, but doesn't create any clear ideas for his readers of what needs to be done.  He'd be happy if we could turn back time and do away with the woman's movement I think, which is what he seems to think is the root of all of today's evil.  (Have you noticed most of the positive reviews are mostly from males and not females?)        
 I read the other review about this book. I dont understand how reader enjoy the book. its boring, many twisted plots is unnessery, the end is little surpising but not convincing at all. I read the book 10 days and I just wait to see where the book will become interesting- its not happen. I never feel so boring in reading a book. This is my second book of deaver. I read the vanished man and I very enjoy but this book was inferior.  Maybe one thing in the book was enjoyable and this is the descriptions of Deaver- like the description of the childhood of  Hrubek and of Lis- this was touching and maybe this give me the fews moments of enjoy in the book 
 I have to agree with the librarian, this book is packaged like a book for small children, but reads like a book for older school aged children and adults.  My kids did not see the humor, even after I tried to explain it to them, they just thought the pictures were scary and sad.  I frankly found the story a little past creative and venturing in disturbing 
 What a joke, not worth the money. I put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through. Swapped batteries, pulled it out, washed it and looked at all the parts. It was either used and resold to me by amazon, or it was defective from the start. And since they have a 30 day return policy, I am now stuck with it, I will see what eastman says next. VERY disappointing, I will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it 
 Willy Wonka meets Dr. Strangelove in this one-of-a-kind cinematic disaster. Barry Levinson's longtime "dream project" emerges as a garish nightmare. The impressive production design wears out its welcome after five minutes while a talented cast sinks in the big-budget quagmire. Another unfilmable concept that somehow received the Hollywood green light 
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 If you are looking for a tape that will slowly lead you through a meditation exercise, with pleasant music in the background and a guide taking you through the steps, this is NOT the tape to get. This is more of an audio book that explains different meditation techniques. If that's what you're looking for, it's not bad, I guess. However, I wanted something else and was disappointed in the purchase 
 This book is a self-indulgent wallow in the mire of despair.  Wolfe starts with the supposition that "our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime," that God is "an unwitting spirit" in "remote eternity," and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope.  The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in "a stone, a leaf, an unfound door," (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since "There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger," "YOU are your world."  This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.  Avoid it for your own good 
 I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also. 
 I have been a fan of spyware doctore for some time. Spyware doctor 4.0 was an excellent product. It did it job pretty good without taking up any significant resource. But unfortunately it seems that PCTOOLS have not yet got their act together for Version 5.0. The first version I received as an upgrade was version 5.0 build 172. Problems started as soon as my machine rebooted. The Spyware doctor service for apparently no reasons hogged the system resource to an extent 95-97%. Killing that does not matter because the application restarts after 15 sec, and also that it seems to be the heart of the application. After reboot the update started running and BAM came the blue screen of death. So after a series of reboots and crashes I installed the version 5 build 176. But that too did not work, hence finally I reverted back to version 4.0 and eveythig works perfectly.Please stay away from Version 5.0 till PCTOOLS get their act together. As a reference do go through the review of CNET for this product [...] 
 This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them.  For a theater lover this is heartbreaking.  What a disappointing story.  If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer.  Even the ending was changed and not for the better.  The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing.  A pretty face is not enough 
 'Nightmare City' aka 'City of the Walking Dead' aka 'Invasion of the Atomic Zombies' (by far the best title) is pretty much the most reviled film of the European zombie cycle of the early 80's.  I don't think this is entirely fair.  Personally, I think this movie is better than Mattei's 'Hell of the Living Dead'.  But, that ain't much of a prize, and this film is pretty damn lousy.  But, it's still worth seeing if you're a zombie fan.  So, as I always say, if you've even heard of this movie, you'll probably think seeing it is worth your time.  In some ways this film is slightly better than average.  The scenes not involving the zombies are relatively competent, perhaps slightly better than what you'd usually get in this sorta film.  None of the characters are remotely interesting, but the acting is not atrocious, if not good either, and the dialogue is rarely laughable. (Except for Anna's ridiculous, luddite social commentary.  And that's funny due to the content, rather than the delivery.)  The problem with this film is the zombies themselves.  Now,  I'm not a total zombie purist, but I can't call this a real zombie film.  I don't care that they run,  and I don't care that they aren't dead (or maybe they are. I forget.  Don't care either  way.)  The problem is that they always use weapons and tools.  Now, it's one thing to use these items sporadically, but they do it all the damn time.  For the most part, these supposed zombies just run up and stab people.  Not very zombie like.  Furthermore, they just aren't animalistic enough.  The fast zombies in '28 Days Later' and the new 'Dawn of the Dead' were at least wild and out of control.  These ones just seem like murderous people with gunk on their heads.  What it all comes down to is that these zombies are just lame.  They look terrible, with just some ridiculous lumpy crusty crud on their heads, at best, or just some black goo. Lame behavior and lame appearence= LAME.  I think if they'da made this with regular zombies it could've been a middle of the road zombie pic, and if they had some decent gore.  The gore in this is terrible, other than a few amusing exploding heads.  It's not especially gory for this sort of film either, though again, this isn't much of a loss considering the quality of it.  There's not too much else to say, it's just a lotta angry zombies running around cutting people up.  Reasonably amusing, but not much more than that.  The only really great moment is when a pack of zombies bursts in on an operation, and one surgeons flings a scalpel across the room and into one of the zombies necks.  That was pretty sweet.  Yeah, that's it.  Amusing, but just barely.  Grade: D 
 The authors theories are a strange blend of biblical and alternative origins.  As others have pointed out the authors personal credentials are in question.  (Rexford Morey of Lawrence Livermore is the inventor of ground penetrating radar.)   
 I enjoyed this film , but it has nude childern and I did not think it was needed in the story  
 The book reads like a gripping novel. Unfortunately, the evidence the author uses is pretty much innuendo, hearsay, and rumor. Having been a student there, his comments are exaggerated. Yes, there are some problems about the curriculum and professors who deem themselves self-important, but I doubt this problem is only at Harvard. This book capitalizes on the desire in America to see the  top stumble once in a while 
 Well it certainly was a very pleasant book, wasn't it?  Diverting and well written, with good characters to root for and a setting that felt reasonably unique and detailed, it has everything going for it except for a solid story line that left me wanting anything, let alone "more".  Except maybe a genuine reason to care for the characters.  Maybe bit more tension.  Or any tension at all, really.    There are no great acts of villainy here: no mad wizards, no slavering beasts (except in one flashback), no plots to avenge ancient wrongs or bring about Armageddon.  The antagonists here are bureaucratic in nature.  Here we have a king who wants to control magic and magicians (but never cruelly, mind you) under the guise of education and a creepy aide who wants to help the king get his misguided way.  That's essentially it.  It's not an ideal situation, but neither is it especially harrowing.  As a result, our heroes (all of them creative types who you can't help but root for) muddle about, falling in love, chaffing at the roles society forces them to play and getting in to tight situations that never feel perilous.  Will the gardener escape the Twilight Quarter unharmed?  Can the professors decipher the mystery of the school's utterly nonthreatening yet vaguely irritating labyrinth in the basement?  Even the one chase scene feels as though it's been awkwardly wedged in to ramp up the excitement and falls apart upon further consideration.  Ultimately the good guys win and the bureaucrats are forced to concede that changes must be made.  Which would be impressive except that, aside from their misguided beliefs, we're given no reason to really root against the bureaucrats.  OK, so the king is going to force his daughter to marry his aide and they the king and the aide are both so wrapped up in the workings of the kingdom that they never listen to her when she has important things to say but... is this really that big a deal?  They're not genuinely evil, they're not malevolent, they're just set in their ways.  They're bureaucrats, which diminishes the climax of the book, giving it all the emotional weight of an After-School Special; preferably one that's about how everyone is unique and should be cherished and nurtured and... and I learned something, too, I guess.  It was diverting enough, it was fun on the bus and in the coffeehouse, but in the end I just don't think it was that good or even that much fun 
 I did have to buy this book for a class and I view it as a total waste.  It is just another self help book...if you wish to stray away from the reality of life and have something to blame your problems on this is the book for you 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 I am a great admirer of David Suchet's Poirot, but I found this production disappointing.  Despite being filmes in Egypt with breathtaking scenery, most of the touches of warmth and humour that make a Christie novel such a pleasure to read are missing from this production.  The three young people in the love triangle that is the basis for the mystery all seemed to me entirely lacklustre.  The worst thing of all though, is that two of the most charming and interesting people in the book, Timothy Allerton and his delightful mother, have had their characters grotesquely distorted until they bear virtually no resemblance to their originals, and there is a quite gratuitous and disgusting implication of an incestuous relationship between them which is certainly not implied in any way in Agatha Christie's novel.  The girl who, in the book, Timothy Allerton loves, has had her character changed and subdued until she barely makes any impact on the story at all.  All this makes this a very disappointing production.  The Ustinov film is better 
 The fact that the story is left unresolved isn't particularly an issue for me... In my opinion, the movie is decent, but the plain truth is that it is simply not that interesting. Of course, it is a good premise... basing a film on the human ability to deal with guilt. The writer has chosen a random and mundane situation, I'm sure intentionally, to delve into for the story, but it just isn't all that good. The acting is mediocre, the pace is painfully slow... It's just not right for everyone. I have a high tolerance for a slow-paced film that eventually leads you somewhere, but this movie was slow-paced and led me to a disappointing ending. 2 stars for the idea, but that's about it 
 The studio should have invested more in the film to dvd transfer, the colors are a real disaster especially in "The Gang's All here". I whish I could ask for a refund. You know now what to expect.. 
 Don't pay Amazon $34 for this subscription when you can get it directly from National Geographic for $15 
 In the spirit of fairness I have attempted to read this book twice now and have put it down with a sick feeling in my gut. It's the same feeling I get whenever I find myself in the company of someone  extraordinarily pretentious and self-absorbed. I just wanted to read something intersesting about Greece. Instead, this book tells me a lot more about the peculiar psychology of the author more than anything else. I hate knowing I wasted my money of this drivel. I've yet to find a better example of mental mastrubation in my Amazon purchases. 
 This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next.  However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives.  A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband?  It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research.  That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book.  I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it.  It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure 
 This book is the hardest book I have ever encountered in my electrical engineering experience. I have to relearn the electrodynamics theory in CGS units and form the physicist perspective. Jackson is famous for his nearly impossible to solve problems as well as his abstract derivations throughout the book. At least I ended up with an A in the course after a semester's hard work 
 this film had a few laughs but it never really got working for me.James Belushi always seems to get the sidekick role even in films where He is the Main star.it is a very cliched type of film but it has some moments 
 Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does "Dream of Mirrors" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with "Thin Line" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original "Iron Maiden" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named "Too old, too tired!" & quit defiling the great name of "IRON MAIDEN" 
 i bought this today (razor 3d the ultimate 3d experience) and have tried 3 dvds with it, used all the different settings, and so far it offers more depth perception, but is definitely not jump-off-the-screen 3d.  i was using a regular tv.. 32" crt sanyo, and again i could tell a difference in depth but it is confined to the square boundary of your television.. it is absolutely not come-out-of-the-screen at all.  plus it kinda hurts my eyes.  i was disappointe 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 Before buying this book.  I wish I had.  I was disappointed in this book.  Jane Eyre is one of my favorite novels, I also loved Wide Sargasso Sea, but this book is nowhere close to being as good.  The reason this book failed is that the author tried to write a book that was an extention of Jane Eyre but could also stand alone.  The problem with this is that the person most likely to read this book, fans of Jane Eyre, want to read about familiar characters and make connections to the original story, which this book fails to provide.   Since this story is written by a different person and at a different time, it is understandable that the feel of the book is different, and I did not expect a book that was exactly like Jane Eyre.  However, this book is billed as a companion to Jane Eyre so the author owes it to her readers to make a connection to the original story. Instead the author fails dismally in her attempt to reproduce the original characters.  Every character was wrong and did not resemble the originals.  The author portrayed Adele as a rebelious, scheming, unhappy girl, whereas in Jane Eyre Adele was happy if not resigned to her lot in life.  Even the character of Jane Eyre is not portrayed accurately in this book.  Speaking of accuracy, there are a lot of inaccuracies in this book.  Like others have mentioned, it's almost as if the writer had never read Jane Eyre.  I think the writer chose to ignore certain facts in order to make the original story fit her own.  This is a mistake as anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be annoyed by the inconsistencies.  The grossest inconsistency being (in my mind) was the supposed murder of Bertha before she fell off the roof.  It was made clear in Jane Eyre and earlier in this book that Bertha was seen and heard screaming before she jumped.  Finally, I was most disappointed in the cheesy overwrought soap opera ending.  Mrs. F as a murdering maniac who is so intent an Ingram/Rochester marriage that she kills the first wife and dangles the current wife over a ledge?  Unbelieveable.   Even if I had never read Jane Eyre I still could have not enjoyed this book.  The dark, garbled plot and all the twists and turns make this a difficult read 
 If you're looking for a presentation skills book, this is the wrong book to buy. It deals mainly with Business Etiquette--how to make an entrance, how to shake hands, how to enter a room invisibly if you're late for a meeting, what to do on a bad hair day, etc.   You won't be shown how to plan your opening, organize your slides, deliver your ideas, or deal with difficult questions at the end of your presentation.  Then there are some other problems that made the author lose this reader's respect. For example, did you know that Lao Tzu--that seminal Chinese philosopher from around 500 BC--was a famous communication and image coach? (It's on p. 19.)  From the number of stars it has received from other reviewers, it is clear that several people found this book helpful. It must fulfill a certain need. However, I was looking for a presentation skills book (I provide training in Taiwan to help Chinese businesspeople present their ideas to Americans and Europeans. [... 
 I love the idea of this product. Like many of the other reviewer's I don't have the regular traditional style crib. Our crib converts to a toddler bed. This product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs. I would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one's that are more with the current styles of cribs, like mine's. 
 i love nature and cowboy movies.  Jeremiah Johnson was on of the best movies i've seen.  it is unforgetable.  It was my favorite  RobertRedford movie.  He did very little talking talking in this movie, he just acted, his best performance ever.  the movie deals with the american indian also, in a profound and touching way.  this movie is engrossing and based on a true story,  it's simply the best. Don't miss the opportunity to see this movie, it is a classic.  It truly is in a league of it's own.               
 don't just automatically hit "not helpful" because you unconditionally love sufjan, think about it. these are b sides, and more of the same. problem with sufjan is, he's brilliant, but not exactly varied. he's beginning to ape himself over and over again with similar time signatures, arrangements, and all slowly evolving towards the charm of a book report. Would like to see Sufjan stop the cloying/cutesie states project and sing about something personal to himself rather than the construction of a ferris wheel in Illinoi 
 If it were possible to give this movie zero stars, i would have. Although it may have won an Academy Award and been considered great in it's day, it is now outdated and boring. Unless scenes of teenagers trying to have sex with anyone are interesting to you, then maybe you will find it interesting. When i say anyone, i do mean anyone. The main chracter, Sonny, who is a teenager sleeps with Ruth, wife of his footbal coach and the young girl, Jacy, sleeps with her mother's lover on a pool table. The film also attempts to bring up homosexuality but keeps it muted. You would think a movie called "The Last Picture Show" would be more about a picture show but it really has very little to do with the movie. There is some nudity which was huge for the time of it's release since it was practically unheard of. The film is also completely in black and white which was a choice of the director so the film could give a better feel of the time period, 1950's. This movie also gives a bad impression of those who live in the country, making them look like they are so bored of their desolate surroundings that they must seek sex with anyone who is willing. If this movie would have been made in present day, it would be your typical porn movie but since none of the sex scenes are actually shown they just show the faces and i guess that is what it allows it to be called an "award winning movie" and not a porn. Also if you think the movie was bad, try reading the book it was based off of, much worse 
 I have the Institutes and I have read with careful atention Calvin`s Doctrine of Salvation. He teaches pretty well some  christian truths. He uses the bible and the church fathers, but when Calvin gives his (or Luther`s) peculiar teachings, he shows how unchristian his doctrine really is by NOT quoting a single NT text or church father to support what is nothing more than an heretic view. Just to give an example: he teaches in this book that the good works of the christian stink, smell horrible, but Calvin doesn`t give a single quote from the NT or the fathers to support this view. His teaching is clearly anti biblical. One more: When he teaches about Righteousness he never quotes Matthew 5:20. In this text Jesus tells us that if our justice is not superior than the scribes' we won`t enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Justice for Matthew is good work of love for God and the needy (Mt 6:1). Calvin simply doesn`t quote this biblical text, and just read his commentary on his "Harmony of the Gospels" and you will see how in some 29 lines Calvin just run from the simple sense of this text, and that`s because Mt 5:20 goes against his doctrine (salvation by faith alone).  Calvin taught that salvation can`t be lost, even tough this doctrine wasn`t taught by the church fathers (not even by Augustine). Read Daniel Corner`s Conditional Security of the believer" Yes you will find in this book his classic insult to God: that He has predestined some people to hell. And Calvin`s use of violence to support his views is well known. Let`s reread the Bible without Calvin`s lens.  
 Former Philadelphia newscaster Larry Kane scrapes the bottom of his memories of covering The Beatles and few encounters with Lennon afterward to pad this combination of memoir and hagiography.   Kane covered the Beatle tours as a radio reporter and his book about them, "Ticket to Ride," is considered an excellent fly-on-the-wall account. Here, he takes his material, what little information he's gathered, padded it with bombastic praise for the group and nearly everyone who knew or worked with them then tacked on 33 pages of fan letters. Kane is besotted with Lennon and uncritically takes his side whether John is using his rough tongue on his friends, cheating on his wives or behaving badly while taking copious amounts of drugs and alcohol.  Kane wraps the Beatles in fulsome prose that would embarrass the most hardened egotist. The Shea Stadium concert? "An epic moment in contemporary entertainment" Onetime band mate Stu Sutcliffe? "In the formative years of John's march to eternal greatness, Stu Sutcliffe was a colossal figure." Even Beatle experts aren't spared this trowelwork, with one authority called "the world's greatest scholar" on the group. This fulsome praise makes for hard reading.  Kane's prose settles down when he describes the private moments he shared with Lennon while on tour, and there's a wonderful section describing the weekend Lennon spent in Philadelphia helping Kane's station with its telethon in 1975. The accompanying 40-minute DVD mixes a promotional interview with Kane with a 13-minute interview from 1968 with Lennon and McCartney, and a few seconds of Lennon giving the weather report as part of the telethon promotion. So while there are some interesting bits, it wasn't enough to justify a book. As they say in the record business, I didn't hear a hit 
 Although it could be more, this book is only an in depth historical study of the prophets from a Jewish perspective.  However, as Christians, we know that Jesus came to fulfill the law and the prophets. The prophets in this study were warning the Jewish people, but they were also foretelling the good news about Jesus Christ, the Messiah. Yet, Heschel ignores this essential purpose of God for the prophets. Yes, the prophets had a profound place in the history of the Jewish people, and, even though Heschel ignores the truth, and glosses over key verses like Isaiah 7:14, the prophets' message is not confined to that small time or that people in history, as Heschel would have us believe, but is still relevant to all of us today to point the way to Jesus Christ as the Savior and Deliverer of the whole world 
 I thought this book was all over the place, but maybe that was because I only read it before I went to bed. There were flashbacks and flash forwards and I thought the author was trying to be overly clever.  None of the characters were really that interesting to me.  It was sad that Jean didn't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one.  Wow!  I hope I don't end up like that when I am her age.  How could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things.  What a miserable life!  I am glad this book was short or I would have put it down sooner.  I am not sure if I would read any of her other books.  I do like the fact that it is set in North Carolina, which takes me back home.  I thought this was a boring book with little moral value for me.  It is probably because I couldn't relate to the characters because I just don't live my life in total isolation.  Others might get more out of it that have life experiences that mirror these characters 
 Hacking Wireless Networks for Dummies is a terrible book. If you are a regular person with social skills you have likely noticed that computer guys do not know how to communicate. They enjoy being geeky and learning all the techno speak of certain topics so they can try and sound smart. This is exactly what this book is 387 pages of. The authors are classic computer geeks who love their nonsense talk.  Nothing is really explained. This is a "Dummies" book. That would suggest to me that the authors are going to drop the geek babble and talk like humans. They do not. Fortunately I have the computer knowledge to follow techno babble. What is unfortunate is these guys are very inaccurate. They babble on (they repeat sections of the book MANY times, cut and paste style) almost as if they just wanted to fill pages. Many of the tools discussed are known not to work. They recommend Linux and Unix tools knowing full well the "Dummie" audience will not be able to use this info.  The entire book is more of a 387 page advertisement for why wireless is insecure (the first chapter is an advertisement). You will not know how to hack anything after reading this book. The 387 pages could have easily been pared to 150. Take out all the repetition and nonsense (they babble on about garbage throughout the book)  I used to like and recommend Dummies books years ago. However I haven't found many in the last few years that really cover a topic well. It seems like they simply want to put the title on the shelves. The content is not a concern. If you are a regular person this book will put you to sleep. If you do manage to get thru it you will learn very little. If you are a computer expert this book contains absolutely nothing that you cannot find in any forum on the net. There is no useful info in this book. Internet forums are free and up to date. A few Google searches would provide more value then this 387 pages of repetitive nonsense.  If you see it in the bargain bin for $1 ... PASS. 
 I've read this book out of curiosity, but unfortunetely found it to be without real or factual substance and no objective conclusion. Rather, it was politically motivated and written by someone who is naturally biased towards Isreal, and could not possibly have the objectivity nor the intention to write the full truth. Saudi Arabia may be a country with many extremists and people who hate America or the west, but we cannot take this view without looking at the big picture and all other factors including Isreal and the Isreali Arab conflict into consideration as well as the Amrican role in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Middle Eastern regimes that are supported by the United States. Therefore, I can honestly say that this book is worthless, dangerously biased, and incite hatred rather than understanding 
 I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...        
 I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another. 
 This television hasn't worked right since I got it, and support is not so great.  I simply cannot get it to display in full screen.  Comcast doesn't carry the id# which makes setup complete guesswork.  I really might as well have bought a good 32 inch set.  Well, I do get the advantage of the taller screen in 4:3 aspect, which is nice.  The picture quality is fine.  I have seen reviews about the clunky remote, but I don't have any problems with how it looks or feels.  You do have to aim it pretty close to the bottom of the set.  Right now I wish I had spent another $600 
 I came to Blowback by way of a year-long research project on  globalization. Over the past year I have read dozens of books, both scholary and popular, on this topic. Right - Left - Love America - Hate America - Multi-Cultural - Eurocentric; I've suffered through them all ( happily, there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject ).   First let me state that Chalmers Johnson, this regrettable book notwithstanding, is not by profession the village diot. Johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst, a man who used to be worth listening to.  What happened?  How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg? Where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from? Johnson, where did you go?  Well, the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge.  His take on America's military policies is ludicrous.  Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50+ years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north, where he will discover NORTH KOREA. Of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy.  Conspiracy "theory" is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated; it's their sanctuary; but for a scholar of Johnson's caliber to go there is incomprehensible. Unti you see what I saw.  The professional works that I read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free-trade and concluded more-or-less-nothing, all in scholarly language.  For the most part the popular books were  not nominally about globalization at all, although globalization was the only thread holding the books together, and to each other. Brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the mustard-gas-like effect of that era at your peril ),the only possible reason for these immensely angry, nonsensical books is this: no one fully understands globalization.  No one. Even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast, too young to tame; growing unpredictably every day like the Blob. They're frustrated, these authors.  I can't blame them, but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the've rounded up the usual suspect, America, as in why does America impose - dominate - ignore, etc. the third world?  Silly question, really. You're at the top of the food chain, what do they expect you to do? When bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else.  
 Enough? Bill McKibbon's had ENOUGH of the biotechnology revolution? He hasn't seen anything yet. The best is yet to be imagined.. 
 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 As a Vodou Houngan I read this book with expectations of it being the usual banter with only a marginal amount of information.  What I found was something else entirely.  A book that has false information in it and manages to have an author against Vodou.  Calling it "hysterical nonsense" I believe was the term used.  The author stated this near the end of the book.  Please!...  Unless you know A LOT about Vodou don't read this book.  The Tao of Physics or Divine Horsemen are MUCH better alternatives 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 authors should find real jobs instead of creating witchhunt after witchhunt looking for those evil militia people who want to blow up the world.  this stuff would be laughable if it wasn't so serious. The left cries about McCarthism but is doing the exact same thing here by creating villians and devils where there are none.  Peddeling hate and fear even if based on loose facts or lies works for some 
 For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around.  It gives a classic "torpedo" shape to the breasts, does not offer any lift, and is pretty much unwearable.  
 I've always been fond of Clive Cussler books, although his more recent ones have had me groaning a lot because he keeps appearing in them as himself, never a good thing for any author. Nightprobe, however, is his one duff effort. The concept of Great Britain signing Canada over to the US is so implausible that I actually laughed - no British Government would have done such a thing, especially as the War was supposed to be over "by Christmas", according to popular wisdom. And given the fact that the US entered the war three years after the fictional treaty was signed, that would kind of make it obvious that the terms had not been adhered to. So why, after 70-odd years, would the treaty still be valid? The other thing which increasingly irritated me is the fact that Cussler seems to have had no idea as to how the Empire worked. Britain couldn't have signed Canada away because it didn't own it - the Dominion of Canada had its own Government, as did Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. And the thought of George V signing Canada away is so laughable that it's totally implausible. Cussler seems to have had the notion that what London said the Colonies followed. Well, times had changed. Read this book if you want a lesson on a silly plotline 
 This is one of the worst text books I have ever used for a course.  The content is dense and difficult.   Chapters are not well outlined and don't follow sequence provided in text.   Too many inconsistencies in the data and materials.  Chapter 12, page 524 says that the HEDIS quality review has 56 measures, the glossary says 71.  This is only one of many I identified.  I spotted far too many grammatical errors, incomplete sentences and more for a 3rd Edition book.    It is more than obvious that some updates have occured in certain sections but have not been rolled throughout the entire text.  This textbook is in dire need of an overhaul and condensing.  Major points are diluted with it's over-complicated verbiage, poor flow and lack of comprehensive outline.    
 I would not neccessarily call this book "Christian".  It is more of an historical account, Bible as literature type of book.   It does make you think about different aspects of Jesus life, but most of that is speculation or perception.    Yancey leaves the reader hopeless at the end.   
 I was very much looking forward to recieving this title from Amazon.com after reading the first few pages online. And, admittedly, I did like the first few chapters; however, the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly, and became almost smug and self-aggrandizing. The authors seemed far too pleased with themselves, and, by approximately the halfway point I felt as if I were reading some kind of bizzare Conservationist Manifesto. I like to think - as a self-appointed conservationist and vegan - that I try to mind Mother Nature and all living creatures, but after I finished reading this repetitive, pedantic bore, I lost the will to care. Maybe I am being too harsh, but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter; then, it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant. Others liked the book, and that's fine; But I was disappointed 
 I was sucked into this book as one of the "campanion" books to a book that I was purchasing through Amazon.  I was hoping for an insightful book on our culture, instead it was just a bunch of whining people who use tiny examples of people behaving badly in public and try to roll it into an argument that our society is basically bad. Honestly, they use examples like people acting rudely on a bus!    The only type of person who would enjoy this book is a crotchety old fart who is looking for evidence that his bitchy, whining, and negative view of the world is correct.  Everyone else should avoid this book!  Oh, the introduction is written in an extreme acedemic style. It's been awhile since I studied up for the GRE, so I had to pull my thesaurus out a number of times to try to follow the editor's introduction.  I gave up after awhile because it was obvious that he had a bigger thesaurus than mine. (I couldn't find some of the words!)  Okay, I'm impressed, your vacabulary is bigger than mine, but you lost your audience, so what's the point?!!  Save your money, and avoid this book.  Patrick Robinso 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I was surprised to find this book very unhelpful in my new tutoring business. It mainly discusses the relationship between the tutorer and tutoree and provides no information on tutoring techniques, etc.  A real  disappointment 
 I thought that this book would be enlighting, but it proved other wise. I began to read this book and felt myself bewitched, until something snapped in me and I said to myself "What kind of book am I reading!" I stopped reading the book and will never pick up another book written by Liz curtis Higgs: which is a shame for she does have talent to write books. Now I will tell you what i found in this book which is offensive.  In the beginning it says how the pregnant woman puts all her trust in God, but yet believes in silly superstition. Another thing is how Jamie falls in love with Rose just for her looks; that is not true love! - The father doesn't love his daughter's, just wants to marry them off. -Rose even says that she is not ready for marrige but yet goes against herself. -Jamie is Rose's cousin, but yet wants to marry her.(You are not allowed to marry family!) -Leana, for some reason falls in love with Jamie, how? Who knows. - If Jamie really did love Rose, he would of waited for her to come and then marry her, no matter what. But instead he asks Leana to take her place, which is the most stupidest thing ever, in other words he is not married to Rose in the eyes of the true God. - Leana commits the sin of adultery (Before doing this, she was asking for Rose's forgivness : if you know what your about to do is wrong then don't do it! - Her father threatens her, if she doen't get married to Jamie then she won't get married at all, as if Jamie was the only man on earth...   There is no romance in this book only stupidness, if you want true romance then read books by Dee Henderson or find another author who rights true romance. Don't waste your time on such useless books that only damages your soul and mind. You my just ignore all the wrong in this book, but if a person continues to read books such as these, it will be engraved into your thinking,and then you won't even see the sin in it, but accept as right.   
 I bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player. I tried it for at least 10 times, but no luck. Wet clean the lense manually is the best way, but that will include getting the player out from the dash board 
 I was very disappointed with this book, especially since one of my friends saw it on the Oprah show and I like many of her recommendations.    I feel like the book and the questions lack depth. The questions are very shallow and not the sort of questions I would ask and want to be asked from the person with whom I want to create a closer, more intimate connection.    If you really want to take a look at it, check it out from the library or spend a few minutes browsing it at the bookstore.   
 I am a wife who was cheated on. How pathetic that there is a book out there to help the other woman. Don't waste money on this book as I will give you advice for free. Ready? Don't date married men you slimeballs 
 Interesting, but I hadn't expected the "question/answers" format.  However, I am getting through it 
 Have you heard?  Many Christians are seeking authentic Christian church life.  And they are leaving the institutional church (i.e. the religious buildings, empty pagan rituals, professional staff members, etc.) to experience it!    This I applaud.  Many Christians would do well to read "Pagan Christianity" by Frank Viola.  The institutional church is not the model given to us by the apostles.  And please know... I grew up a Southern Baptist and was on the ministerial staff for 6 years.  This conclusion was not all that easy to embrace.  However, I did discover it to be true.  Most truth loving people recognize the institutional church doesn't bring the results we see in the book of Acts. (e.g. read "Church Planting Movements" by David Garrison, published by the International Mission Board)  Yet, many are not willing to leave the comfortable confines of the man-centered institution to discover real ekklesia.  So... why did I rate this book so poorly if I am a part of a "house church" myself?  Because this book dishes out church in homes like it was fast-food!  Tony and Felicity Dale seem like wonderful people who have seen some great things happen in homes, but it would seem their method of starting churches is not founded in the N.T.  First, they use a proof-text (Matt.18:20) to establish the existence of a church.  A true church is a group of believers in a particular locality who have joined together in community for the purpose of gathering around Jesus Christ. (e.g. read "The Normal Christian Church Life")  A church is not just getting a couple of Christians together and doing a bible study or singing some songs. This idea is a really popular strand of "house church" that has many rushing out prematurely to do this.  These people have no real solid foundation and knowledge of the roles and workings of an apostle(church planter), prophet, pastor/teacher, etc.  In chapter 10 "IT'S OK TO START A CHURCH," the Dales encourage you to nonchalantly go out and find someone who will allow Christians to meet in their home and walla!  You will have a "house church".  Question: is this the model in Acts?  Go read it.  The Dales even admit from their experience that the life of many a "house church" does not last very long.  Why?? I believe it is because "Simply Church" is so simple it is not biblical.  If you believe that the church gathering in homes apart from the religious systems of man is what Christ and the apostles intended, then you must believe there is an order to things.  (e.g. Eph. 4:11)    However, if you believe church is a "cell group" or some other kind of alternative fellowship to the insitutional church... I imagine you can do whatever you want.  And many do.  Unfortunately, these "house churches" usually do not last.  Why would you want to trade one wrong practice (the institutional church) for another (house church as alternative)?  It is not an alternative.  It is the model given by the apostles to the community of saints.  We must be careful we do not trade one man-centered institution that meets in a building for another man-centered instituion that meets in a home!  Remember-- Real Christian church life comes by gathering around Jesus Christ in the order of the New Testament.  T. Austin Sparks puts it this way, "The church is measured by Christ: more Christ, more church; less Christ, less church."  The simplicity is found in gathering around Christ with a New Testament understanding of who we are and how we are to function within a local community of believers.  A biblical "New Testament" church comes about by a group of believers gathering around Christ the Head of the body.    The journey that you embark on in a true church... I believe can be represented in a picture.  It is a picture of believers hand-in-hand circled around the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.  This community is singing, encouraging, rebuking, correcting, and edifying for the worship of the one in the center:  Jesus Christ, the lamb who was slain!  Don't get hung up on mimicking the "first-century style" of church... be consumed with Christ!  Place him in the center.  In time... you will discover your church life is authentic.  I highly recommend you read the writings of Frank Viola if you are interested in gathering around Jesus and experiencing the freedom of the first-century church.  His book set is very helpful for those who seek to model Christianity in Acts.  He references his claims to Scripture.  Frank Viola's set: 1. "Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the N.T. Church" 2. "Who is Your Covering: A Fresh Look at Leadership, Authority, & Accountabiltiy" 3. "Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices" 4. "SO YOU WANT TO START A HOUSE CHURCH?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today" 5. "From Nazareth to Patmos: The Saga of the N.T. Church"  I also recommend reading: "Paul's Idea of Community: The Early House Churches in their Cultural Setting" by Robert Banks "The Normal Christian Church Life" by Watchman Nee "Life Together: The Classic Exploration of Faith in Community" by Dietrich Bonhoeffer "God's Ultimate Passion" by Frank Viola "The Untold Story of the New Testament Church" by Frank Viola * "The Release of the Spirit" by Watchman Nee 
 Masquerading as a text on correctly using infrared, I found this book very poorly written, loaded with errors and containing amatuerish photographs. I felt ripped off. I will look for better written books on the subject. If I could have looked the book over ahead of time, I never would have purchased it 
 I don't understand why everyone's giving this movie rave reviews!  The actings horrible, the film's dragged out, and the cliche's pile up so high that I couldn't even see the movie at the very end!  When I watched the part of "Chaplin" sitting in his sofa with a glass of wine contemplating how he could help the common man I wanted to throw up and laugh out loud at the same time -- not a good combination.  To reiterate:   1) Bad, wooden acting 2) Dragged out storyline 3) Bad plot (hard to tell what's going on at times) 4) Unimaginable amount of cliche's   Stay away from this movie 
 I bought Trawler because I had read O'Hanlon's previous books, Into the Heart of Borneo and No Mercy, and so thoroughly enjoyed them, I could hardly put them down.  By contrast, Trawler was such a huge disappointment, I could hardly bear reading it until I finally put it down for good without finishing it.  It's full of the kind of fishing and sailing detail of Moby Dick, but without Melville's nuance or complexity.  Instead, we get an insignificant frenzy of unrelated "facts" that we might expect from someone in a drug-induced state, who imagines that each experience during that time is fraught with deep significance.  It's perhaps telling that early on, O'Hanlon admits that "months after the contract was signed," he still owed his publisher a book.  Trawler ought to serve as a reminder not to let term papers go unwritten until the night before they're due 
 This story is very dark, full of menace and dark thoughts. Not great for kids. OK for adults if that's what you like. A hard story, not much gentleness in it except for a couple of moments 
 I don't understand how this book gets so much high overall praise.  I must be too much the lowbrow bore to appreciate the literary heights which this book apparently achieves.  I plowed through seemingly endless dense pages, full of arcane references without explanation.  Nothing flowed.  I tried skimming - I still couldn't find somewhere to start things better off.  I had to give up 
 I really need to learn to put books down when I realize they are bad and stop wasting my time, but there is that side of me that really must find out what happens in the end.   I started off being annoyed by the writing style, then got intrigued again once the Horse Whisperer entered the picture.    When Annie and Tom began their affair, it went downhill all over again. The sex scene was WAY over the top - not romantic or sweet - more like a cheap romance novel.  An example of the bad writing? "And he felt no shame nor saw any in her, for why should they feel shame at what was not of their making but of some deeper force that stirred not just their bodies but their souls and knew naught of shame nor of any such construct?".  Let's put aside how we might feel about adultery not being of "their own making", and maybe even put aside the fact that that sentence seems to be missing a comma or two.  "...knew NAUGHT of shame nor of any such CONSTRUCT?"?????  Give me a break.  That about says it all.  That and the ending was infuriating and completely out of character.  Would a supposedly kind and gentle man allow a child who had been through such trauma, or any child at all, to witness such an awful scene? The author certainly makes it seem as though it were a deliberate act, not an accident.  If he were going to be such a coward, couldn't he have at least had the dignity to do it somewhere alone? That the author would leave you with the notion that it was anything other than an accident is maddening.  Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.  
   Tullio Kezich claims to have been a long time friend of Federico Fellini and perhaps that's one of the several reasons this biography is very disappointing.    Kezich approaches his subject as an insider, someone who shared the same social circle and perhaps artistic pretensions. (Kezich is descibed as a film critic, author of numerous boks on cinema and a playwright.)    The book is worshipful of Fellini, talks a lot about parties, drops a lot of names, but gives precious little information about Fellini. What information it does provide reads more like a campaign tract for sainthood. Comments such as "[t]he grief over his death is indescribable" add nothing to our understanding of Fellini as man or artist.    The situation is not helped by Kezich's writing style which, charitably, can only be described as bloated and pretentious. Perhaps the blandness is partly due to translation. Paragraphs run on forever, sentences are often incomplete and reminiscent of a high school student trying really, really hard to be impressive.    Amazingly, for a book about one of the greatest of all film makers, there is not a single photograph. Likewise the author presumes that any one reading the book will remember every detail of Fellini's films, most of which I haven't seen in 30 years or so.    I had hoped for a biography that would lead me into Fellini's life and mind. Instead all I got was a list of parties he went to and some fluffly, adulatory prose about great his movies were. I already knew that --- I wanted to know more about Fellini made such great movies. Not in this book.  Jerr 
 This is a disappointing book. The main points of Atatrk's career - hero of his country's war for independence and founder of the modern secular state of Turkey, a man with some remarkably modern views for his place and time - make him one of more attractive hero-figures of the twentieth century.  But somehow Mango does not succeed in giving us the living, breathing man. Indeed, Mango manages to make some of the genuinely exciting events of Atatrk's career read like rather dull broadsheet accounts.   Mango is certainly a scholar. That comes right through, but there is a somewhat lifeless quality that characterizes much of what should be a smashing yarn of great wars, declining empire, and dashing figures. The great number of Turkish place names and people do not make reading any easier, although Mango does offer a guide to pronunciation at the front.     Interestingly, this appraisal is quite at odds with cover quotes from reviews. One gets expert reviewers' ambiguities like "Takes its place at the top," or "...a higher level of biography than any previous account." Book reviewing in major publications has always been something of game, full of backscratching, favors, and artful ambiguities. The gap here between reviewers' words and Mango's actual work is rather notable.  Still this is a biography of an important figure, one about whom there is limited material in English. It is definitely worth reading. 
 I wasn't expecting Disney, but I was less than thrilled by this feature.  I'm assuming there's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it.  Many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story.    I am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything, but I couldn't get through this whole film 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 Vanishing Voices does a good job of showing how larger languages are destroying smaller ones, and the methods of language death.  This is all pretty much common knowledge.  However, the authors fail in their attempt to give a reason as to WHY language death is something with which we should be concerned.  The only argument they put forth is in a ecological/enviromental analogy, which says that biological diversity is good and stable, therefore, linguistic diversity must.  However, they only go part way in their analogy and reject natural selection for languages.  They also show that linguistic diversity corresponds to environmental diversity, but state this has nothing to do with the inexcessiblity of the areas.  The violin-playing and loaded words are hard to stomach if you are looking for good social science.  I would not suggest the book unless you are an ecological activist wanting to try to link your cause with "saving cultures" or with yet another critique of the West 
 Andy Grove helped to build Intel into the behemoth it has become. On the other hand, he didn't sell IBM on the X86 which was the critical moment nor resolve all the manufacturing processes they had in different fabs (Craig B's watch did that).  This is a relatively short book and could be a lot shorter.  Inflection points... yeah, I get it. Now, please move on Andy.  If you are a high-tech sales or marketing executive and read books like this and are awed by them, you are the probably not the sharpest tool in the drawer 
 Sure, being overprepared gives you a sense of confidence when entering the test room, but the extent that this book went was utterly impractical to the point of being innaccurate about what truly is on the test. For example, it bombards you with slews of obscure literary terms, tells you that you may have to read poetry in unitelligible local dialect, and oh, knowing 500+ years of the history of literature may help. After trying the practice problems on this test I was in a state of desperation (of course I procrastinated so this is the day before the test)and was prepared to just not show up on test day because it seemed so hopeless. However, after trying the Princeton Review book, I decided that if the problems were more like PR's the test actually might be doable. While the test was hard, it was no where near Barron's level; PR was much more accurate. I couldn't break 700 on Barrons and ended up getting a 780 on the real thing. Unless you have a ton of time to prepare, I really would not recommend Barrons. In the end though, what will prepare you the most for the SAT II Literature are the skills you've acquired over the years in English class and reading challenging poetry and prose on your own time 
 There must be a serious vacuum in today's counter/sub-culture around psychedelics. Daniel thrills us with the confrontation with the Bwiti King around the Iboga ceremony. Beyond telling us about some of his own experiences we get to hear what sounds like the drone of a cocktail party.   This work is fairly uneven. If you have never read Terence McKenna you might be intrigued by some parts of this book. Beyond that the work is a ramble, often not just opinionated but also filled with trite wanderings, sometimes you feel like a gadfly as the author dances about in his mind about a wide range of topics and his own spin on psychedelic cultural history. But in the end, there is not much here.   What is also uncomfortable is that the author in person (e.g. Burning Man) brings in liberal use of a certain Four letter word cojoined with it's 7 letter verb form. You get that same kind of hipster spin at times in this book. However it's not hip. 
 Phone broke after minimal use.  Not a good shop phone.  The other reviews say it all.  Stay away 
 There's not an ounce of meat in this book.  This book features a steady stream of the author's self-praise and excessive "name-dropping".  The "conclusions" are certainly not original.  The thesis of the book is never really developed and the text is directionless and slow. 
 If you are a real hard core Sonny Chiba Collector, then this is not worth your time, because he doesn't do really anything in this flick! Why is it not in widescreen? Why is there no original language track? This is DVD right? If you still want this movie to fill the gap in your Chiba collection try to find it in its original format & quality 
 This book is, frankly, pathetic.  Shattuck puts his incredible erudition to work in the service of his conservative Christian convinctions, to write a book that fundamentally condemns intellectual curiosity and advocates institutional obedience.  This, from the man who wrote THE BANQUET YEARS, one of the best intellectual histories of fin-de-siecle Paris.  In his old age, Shattuck apparently feels compelled to take a stand on the subject of society's increasing liberality, which leaves him feeling threatened.   I knew Shattuck personally.  I was one of his students in Boston.  Professor Shattuck, this book is contrary to the spirit of UNI 
   Tens of thousands of books are published every year: few of them sell more than a couple of thousand copies at best. Sometimes you come across a book from a "name" publisher and wonder why the manuscript wasn't tossed into the wastbasket. This is one of those books.    This book is filled with New Age nostrums. "Let's visit the cosmic sphere tht contains our neighborhood - the center of our visible universe." (By the way, Leo Tolstoi visited this neighborhood in the 19th Century in his "The Kingdom of God is Within You.") More great advice from Primack and Abrams, the husband-wife team that claims great new cosmological insights: "Movement becomes a mere idea. There is no visible way to detect it, only the tricky conciousness of time passing." Here's another gem: "The Cosmic Las Vegas metaphor illustrates trhe random, quantum nature of eternal inflation, but it gives no sense of what the theory of eternal inflation could mean if it is true." Yeah. Sure.    Reciting every mawkish statement in this pretentious tome would take as much space as the book itself. As a final example, how about "We represent  an age on Earth comparable to the age of cosmic inflation at the beginning of the universe: brief, but about to set the pattern for the long-term future. . . . For our entire species, today matters."    This New Age gruel is served up as a plea for scientific thinking. It is anything but. It is a feel-good tract on how special you are, much like the character in the classic Saturday Night Live sketch.    Greater good could have been done by saving the trees sacrificed for the paper the nonsensical nostrums of Priamck and Abrams are printed on.  Jerr 
 Released in 2000, this album has come in many different options.  The original album, which is this CD, has 11 songs and is 44 minutes long.  Also available is a Lovers Rock CD with some bonus live tracks on the disc.  There is also two disc option, with the original Lovers Rock CD, and a bonus CD of a few live tracks.  Lovers Rock is also included as a bonus CD in the DVD Lovers Live (which comes in a standard DVD case).  The best value is to get the Lovers Rock CD with the bonus Lovers Live DVD in the standard jewel case. Confusing?  THIS CD DOES NOT MAKE THE MOST OF SADE'S VOICE OR SONG WRITING.  This is really a stark, stripped down sound for Sade, especially when you compare it to her early work.    Seven of the tracks are driven by muted electronic rhythms and a muffled background music.  I don't think the sound works well with Sade's vocal style.  She sings flat and without emotion.  All seven of these tracks sound alike and the CD gets boring and monotonous.    The songs that are good are where she drops the electronic rhythms and lets the emotion of her voice come through, or where she livens up and starts to rock.  On The Sweetest Gift and It's Only Love That Gets You Through, Sade sings to almost no accompanyment.  Here she sings in a great jazz/blues style and really lets the emotion of her voice come through.  King of Sorrow and Immigrant are a little more upbeat rockers. (they are not really rockers, but do rock when you compare to the other tracks on the CD). Here she sings with more energy and variation.  So, if she is the King of Sorrow, I think I might consider turning gay 
 I bought this book thinking that Im going to learn the tricks of the trade about making unique sounds, As i was led to believe that this book has it all, As it was marketed for beginners aswell as advance players. Now Ive been playing guitar for over 15 years. Upon receiving this book and taking a brief glance at it. I realised that i must be a better player than Steve Vai, because i knew every thing that this book had to offer. In Brief: If your starting to play guitar or just learning lead guitar, this book is great.. But if youve been playing for a while or you are in a band, dont waste your time with this book 
 There's not much to say.  The book isn't confusing because the material is too technical--it's often confusing because the author doesn't go in enough depth; it's frustrating when a crucial concept is presented, such as Hamilton's Law, but no examples on its applications are put forth.  I find myself frequently searching the internet to suppliment this textbook.  It also doesn't help that the book doesn't come with a cd-rom, or any additional material, unless you purchase the teacher's edition...reading this textbook makes me yearn for Campbell.   
 Years ago, these really were ground steak burgers with a very special flavor.  The most recent shipment I had was tastless with an unusually chewy texture.  Not recommended 
 I found this story to be extremely elementary.  This Shakespeare fellow obviously has no idea what he is talking about, and I hope he refrains from releasing anything in the near future 
 I had reservations about it when my small group decided to give this book a whirl, and although I was game and tried to like it, I just couldn't.    Liz's overfamiliar style, her judgemental tone, and pandering to churchy already-good-girls reads like a book that reinforces smugness among the churched.  I especially did not like the way she glossed over the difference in 21st Century standards for women, and instead just judged them against today's free-er women's options and opportunities.  I will say that we had many good conversations because we read the book, but in the end, we were all severely disappointed in the book itself.   Examples of what I mean:  some of the "bad girl" scenarios seemed like she was stretching to fill pages, "bad for a good reason" - what?, or nattering on and on about David's sin with Bathsheba - wait, he's not a girl! 
 I didn't like it, first I asked for a nano ipod holder and when I send the sellers a mail asking if my nano will fit, they never answer... now I have it and of course is to big to hold my ipod nano... it isn't for "all ipods" like the web said, and it isn't a solid item also it brokes easily 
 I thought it was a little immature. Not for older readers. It's for young teens to sit around and read to understand their "so-called" feelings about what they have experienced in the recent past. Or a older teen that just remember about a past experienced about at the ages of 4-6. Not for prelonged abuse survivors 
 I am very disappointed.  This book I was told has to be bought with a CD for the computer.  I was given a choice of a book with and without the CD.  I chose the book with the CD and it was not the correct one.  There was no description as to what was on the CD.  I was being asked to choose a book with a SPSS program on the CD and I gotthe introduction to the book with no choices to down load.  You would have better business practices if you required the cd's to be described.  I will have to think very carefully before I order my school books from here again. 
 Many useful, if obvious, ideas here but more often than not it's "my way or the highway." The author has little tolerance for those of us who prefer a certain amount of "chaos" at work. Look elsewhere  before making yourself guilty about your office habits. "Ergonomic  Living" offers a much more realistic and thoughtful approach to the  "real world" modern office 
 I read the Gathering Blue which was written by Lois Lowry. It is a fantasy. It is about a girl who is crippled in her leg named Kira. She has to walk with a cane. 	Some other people in Kira's village want her out because she is worthless. When the Council of guardians find out she is good at weaving they decide to keep her in the village to repair an important robe. 	I liked it because it was suspenseful. You didn't know what was going to happen to Kira at the time.Was she going to be killed? Or worse? 	 
  Come on --- let's have some sanity.  I thought American's were smarter than this.  If most American's believe this, worry 
 I bought this thinking I was going to see some of the skits that made my laugh when I saw them on live TV. What I got instead was a DVD with only a few skits (that were not his best) and some out-takes. Very very dissapointing.   This should've been called "A few randome sketches pulled from SNL with Will Ferrell in them. 
 Terrible writting,This was the first time i bought a book written by mr Cahill.I recommend renting his book if you want to sample his writting but he is very hard to follow with stories that never seem to go anywhere.The book is compose of many short stories and I would have to say that less then 40% of the stories are worth reading 
 Robert Kiyosaki's books are all the same thing re-packaged over and over again. This book could have been condensed into a couple of paragraphs and saved it's readers a lot of time. He writes in an arrogant, condescending manner that is hard to stomach. I would hate to have been his real dad. It's obvious that he despises him and worships at the alter of "Rich Dad." It's offensive and disturbing. Read the first review of this book and you'll have the essence of the whole thing. Don't give this guy any more money for putting out this drivel 
 I am amazed that you send me this review as i have not even received my parcel ,I was promised a refund which i am still waiting  for,  I am trying to get hold of anyone at Amazon to lodged my complain but it has fallen on deaf ears never  will i  purchase anything not even a safety p 
 I would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 & 1/2 years (unless small for their age).  My 4 yr old son (36lbs) got it for his birthday, and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car, but its been "parked" since broken.  I wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted.  The plastic seems cheaply made.  The voice buttons and noises are loud and work well.  Stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month.  Consider a bigwheel 
 It is ok if You want to see it, but I wouldnt recomended to buy it, cause I wont see it more then the timne I saw it, I really do not know why people have given so much stars to a very regular movi 
 I saw the "Young" part.  I even saw the "Black" part.  But "Gifted"?  My God!  This was such a waste of time in my busy life.  I can't believe I was subjected to read such boring nonsense.  If you're thinking of reading this book, DO NOT.  You would have more fun  being dead 
 The worksheets are helpful in applying what Malphurs has just covered. The book is loaded with practical hints and tips. The biggest drawback is that Malphurs relies too heavily on statistics that are questionable and cites some that contradict each other. By that I mean that he cites a statistic about 'Protestant' churches which includes Mormons and Jehovah's Witness. Instead I would recommend Stuart Murray's "Church Planting: Laying Foundations" 
 Aries Spears is cool, but I guess that I set my expectations too high for this one...I should have bought "I Ain't Scared" instead...I'll be selling this one immediately 
 THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE!  IT WAS SO STUPID, I CANNOT BELIEVE I WASTED MY TIME READING NOR MY MONEY BUYING IT.  IT IS COMPLETELY IMMATURE AND RIDICULOUS.  I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE WOULD PUBLISH THIS CRAP 
 I anticipate this review will not garner too many "helpful" votes (since a majority of people appear to have enjoyed this movie), but it is something I need to say anyway.  I am writing this review because I've read quite a few reviews (written by men and women alike) stating that men will hate this film whereas "women will love it." I am a woman and I absolutely hated this movie, the only reason being that it was absolutely boring, and, for lack of a better word, stupid. I can't tell you why it was so painfully boring, but I'm guessing it had something to do with the plot, which is yawn-inductive to begin with.  It is rare that I give out the one-star rating, but this is one of those movies it actually pained me to sit through. I watched it at a family member's house and I fell asleep 3 times. (Note that I am an insomniac and I do not fall asleep easily.) I can't help but resent it a little when people say that "women will love this movie" because it was quite honestly one of the most boring movies I, as a perfectly legitimate woman, have ever seen. To add insult to injury, the Ya-Yas are terribly annoying. A couple of reviewers have said that "to call this a 'chick flick' is insulting to all chicks," and I vehemently agree. I understand that some women probably will like it; my point is only that not all of us will enjoy this dull, insipid movie just because we're chicks 
 I can see how some readers might be put off by all of the science and detail in this book, though I was personally not bothered by it.  There were several things that did trouble me however: 1.) The abrupt switch in the third section from first person to third person.  I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her.  Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either.  2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived.  Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those "clairvoyant" elements. 3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting.  For a truly fascinating real theory about the Ripper murders, read Alan Moore's From Hell.   4.) Absolutely no resolution on what happened to Nick and Christian. 5.) The Jack-Claire affair was just creepy. 
 When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use 
  This book was entirely disappointing for me. I read it in hopes of finding a better understanding and instead found 2 people who sound very bitter and are trying to sell a book through humor and not real facts. Some of their advice include using sex as the "ultimate bargaining too" and ways to "realisticaly rate yourself in a scale of 1-10" and stay in your own playing field(like don't aim for a 8 if you're really only a 5). Scary stuff. This book really depressed me until my (Married) friends pointed out how utterly ridiculous it was. If you are single and searching, stay away from this book 
 I used this book in an MBA International Marketing course.  The text is a very cumbersome read.  While the book contains adequate anecdotal information, the information is poorly organized and often fails to engage the reader.  I routinely found myself searching for more concise supplemental materials for concepts the book failed to develop.  The narratives are extremely wordy and consistently obfuscate salient points.  If I were using the book as an instructor, I would use the country notebook section as a course guide and scrap the rest.   
 This book was very, very informative.  However, it was also very dry.  This book was assigned to me, for summer reading, and as a book, it fails.  As a collection of facts, it is very well done.  If i had been writing a paper, or doing a project on the Minutemen, this would definately be one of my sources.  But, like I said, just to read, this book is not my first choice.  I read it, and took notes, and i still have trouble remembering most of the knowledge contained within "Minutemen and their World. 
 The vast majority of the book has no relation to the title.  There are great passages, but they are largely buried under dozens of pages of yammering prelude, silly bickering, and attempts at drunken humor.  James Morrow's Blameless in Abaddon covers the same theme with much greater depth and breadth 
 This is a common text for many introductory anthropology courses.   It's apparently a classic ethnographic work, but honestly one of the most boring books I think I have ever read 
 I was very dissapointed when I watched A Bing Crosby Christmas.  There was very little of his old Christmas shows and a lot of stuff I didn't care to see.  If I had wanted a biography on Bing Crosby I would have ordered a biography.  I would send this DVD back if I could...don't waste your money on it 
 I purchased this book because I like deviant art, but this one goes beyond deviant..it's just crazed and illogical.  I'd like to state for the record that I have personally killed and helped gut hundreds of chickens.  When you are hungry and dealing with the processing of a winter food supply, sentimentality is a luxury you can ill afford.  I did not believe then nor do I believe now that chicken killers are "Nazis" perpetuating a holocaust.  Sue Coe exaggerates the grim reality of farm animal slaughter, taking it to grotesque extremes.  By attributing human-like emotions to the animals, she tries to get her audience to identify with the victims and respond with pity.  Her portrayal is more melodramatic than accurate.  In fact Sue Coe, like many animal activists, exhibits an almost unhealthy obsession with pain, death, blood, and torture.  The animal rights purity trip allows these gothic animal rights types to guiltlessly wallow in their perversions in the name of a "good" cause.  I don't have any problems with kinky art per se but Sue Coe just goes over the top with her sanctimonious go-veg shock tactics.  While some of the drawings are strictly representational most of them seem self-indulgent and just plain nuts at times.  It's actually a valuable book for the non-believer trying to  understand the animal rights mentality, that's why I am giving it two stars. Perhaps Sue Coe reveals more of that mentality than she really intended. If I was a parent who found this book in a pre teen's room, I'd be seriously concerned.  Sue Coe is definitely not for everyone 
 I am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of Black men in this book and in the movie.  The work offers NO BALANCE whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face.  One Black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel.  It is no wonder Spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves.  The castration of the Black male has always been their main attraction, apparently Oprah's as well 
 As others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  You have to open the phone.  Stupid design.  It does not have any exterior lights, such as my old Samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  This phone needs to be opened to get any info.  Can't even see the time without opening phone.  While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  I don't like that either.  It's also very hard to hear on it.  Especially if in car, with traffic noise.  No, I'm not driving, but I'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  Forget it.  Re the color that someone mentioned.  Cingular is a light pastel pink, TMobile is magenta (dark pink).  The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  I just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  Oh, it must TMobile to get international service.    The phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but I don't use them.  I want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets.  I would never buy this phone again, and as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  I doubt I would get a  Motorola ever again, I'll stick to Samsung. 
 I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better 
 It should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator! I'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind; I'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind. Once you remove the plastic prongs that are designed to relax the head/neck, the base is an approximately 5 inch vibrator.  Just be forewarned, customers, this item is not for the easily offended 
 This documentary covered what I had seen in other documentaries without anything really new.  The only new thing I really couldn't stand was Bettany Hughes comparing the Spartans to the Nazis.  This was so juvenile.  It was a cheap sensationalist way to fill her narrative.  She did it on more than one occasion.  Comparing everything militant to the Nazis is old and out of date.  Yes, the Nazis would have liked to imitate the Spartans is many ways, but the two cannot be compared.  Please skip the cheap sensationalism when dealing with a very interesting ancient Greek society.  There are much better documentares available made by the history channel.  Its a shame to have such an otherwise good PBS production be wasted on poor narration 
 Boring. Boring. Boring. The story is boring. The writing is boring. The characterisation is boring. In a word, the book is a giant bore. I tried reading when it won the Booker. I gave up after three chapters. On seeing some of the comments here, I decided to give Last Orders a second chance. After all, I loved Waterland and if his other books don't come near to matching it, they are readable enough - although I couldn't for the life of me tell you what one of them was about.   Last Orders is told in the first person from the viewpoint of five people. This style of story telling only works if the writing is good enough to give the characters strong enough personalities to be recognisable from their own words. A voice of their own, so to speak. Swift is unable to do this. Without the names of the characters appearing on the chapter headings, it would be difficult to tell who was who. Consequently, I found myself caring little about them and nothing about their journey to Margate. In the hands of a better writer, this may work, but not with Graham Swift. 
 An average movie with average performances. Glosses over many of the details in the book and ignores the role of many important characters. It wont appeal much to the general audience and neither will it satisfy the people who have already read the book. 
 The nastiness of this book, the awful interpretation of Allan Bloom's life, his work, his SELF--just floored me.  I don't know who Saul Bellow saw in Allan Bloom, but I saw a man who could penetrate the minds of the greatest minds:  Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche, Rousseau.  Bloom's day-to-day life?  THIS is what matters?  What if Plato had written about how Socrates went to the bathroom?  That's how bad this book is in my opinion.  A "friend" who missed the whole thing.  A "friend" who savaged his "friend" to make a buck.  How in God's name can you write a (fictional) book about a man who was known for his wonderful teaching ability without one single scene of his TEACHING!    Dumb,  But, more than dumb, cruelly unfriendly and, more than that, a way of upending someone who was dead and unable to defend himself.  I think Bellow may have been, MUST have been envious of his friend's intellect and just let it rip.  I wish Bloom's heirs could get the money Bellow made from this book 
 I bought this item thinking I was getting a healthy snack. The fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup, and it is extremely sweet. Not healthy. 
 What's going on here? All year, I've seen dozens of family movies, new and old. Of those I've seen, only two have been worth mentioning. They're actually incredible movies: The Cat Returns and Balto. Going into any family movie now though, I'm not expecting much. Barnyard didn't help that mind set. I'd like to tell you that I was disappointed by it, but it's exactly what I was expecting it to be. For the most part at least. I didn't expect it to rip off The Lion King, that's for sure. There's not a whole lot to Barnyard really, which is bad to say since the first trailers I saw for it almost 2 years ago made it seem like it'd be a cool lil' movie. Originally called Boy Tipping, it looked like a movie about farm animals getting back at humans who tease them on a regular basis. What happened? Well, considering how the final product turned out, I can't blame them for not showing much in trailers, since, like another bad recent family movie- Happy Feet, things get so boring that it's not worth mentioning. Now, don't think I'm some kid movie hater, because I'm not. Not one bit. But I can't see how anyone without vision or hearing problems can enjoy Barnyard. Why did this thing even get A-list actors to provide the voices? Man I hope Kevin James gets some good roles soon...  We start out by meeting the crew of the farm, which is held together quite well by Ben the cow. He's a tall, dark and beefy bovine who takes out the coyotes who try to feast on the farm folk, and has never let a single animal get harmed under his watch. His son, Otis, doesn't seem like he could care much, since he's a young cow just looking to party and have a good time. He and his buddies skip out on a farm meeting just to go hill surfing. One night though, Ben is overwhelmed by coyotes, and passes away, right before his son. Otis is elected the new head of the farm, but thinks he can't handle it, so he goes about his care free ways, and the entire farm turns into one constant party. They even invite pizza delivery guys to the barn (isn't that sick if the cows and pigs are eating pepperoni though?), not caring too much if they get caught. Heck, when the farmer checks in on them and sees them throwing a huge party, they knock him out several times in order to fix everything. This makes up most of the middle of Barnyard, and it's pretty boring with few jokes that anyone will get much out of. Only later on when most of the chickens are held hostage, does Otis do the right thing and head out to save them, as well as deal with the coyotes like his dad before him.  You could take out the entire second portion of Barnyard, and get the same results. The same jokes are used over and over to the point where you can think up a better one before it's even delivered. I kept falling asleep after the opening due to the lack of anything important or funny happening. Even the big musical numbers were dull. You'd think a rat with sunglasses singing Shaggy's "Boombastic" would be great, and I'm sure it would be, just not here. The only moment from the movie that sticks out in my mind is one that almost doesn't even fit in the movie. When Ben's taking out some coyotes, he's holding a guitar, and plays "I Won't Back Down" by Tom Petty. But given that it's Sam Elliot singing, with his signature deep voice, it's an even more beautiful rendition of the song. It's so great that being in this movie almost holds it down and makes me wonder if it should've even been put here in the first place. I guess mentioning the Lion King rip off bit is worth going into a little more here too. A lot of people claimed that Barnyard took what The Lion King had for the main plot point where Otis didn't want the responsibility of being the head of the farm. A minor thing that could be compared to many movies, sure. But the fact that he also doesn't want to because he makes an agreement with the head coyote (who strongly resembles Scar) seals the deal. Honestly, you're better off showing your kids The Lion King again. I also really do feel sorry for Kevin James being stuck in another lousy movie. After seeing his incredible stand up special, Sweat the Small Stuff, a few years ago, I knew the guy was awesome. His tv series is great too, but his lack of any good movie role choices, as far as I've seen at least, has me worried that he could be fading before he becomes a really big name like he should be.  The picture transfer looks like it was taken from a decent VHS copy. Most CG movies made these days get a great transfer to dvd, but I Barnyard manages to fail in this department as well. Lots of out of focus scenes, fuzz and even some aliasing plague the print. The sound's nice and loud though, and those musical numbers sound great (at least, in the technical sense). Lots of use of surround here for about half the movie, which is more than most animated flicks these days.  I remember commercials boasting that the special features were cool. But yet, once again, things just don't go like the advertisements would lead you to believe. The commentary being such a mess wasn't a good sign for how the other extras on the disc would be. It features Oedekerk, Marshal and "The Barnyard Crew", and is all over the place with people talking over each other. Someone could get a headache 15 minutes into this thing. They talk about some technical aspects, little in-jokes and the like, but never anything that interesting, as I've come to expect from Oedekerk. Boogying in the Barn is your standard featurette fare focusing on the band who made the original songs for Barnyard, North Mississippi All-stars. They seem pretty bored about the whole experience, even during the studio footage. Utter Talent is another short featurette that covers the voice actors, big or small. It's kinda sad to see the director praise some of the actors so much when most of them barely had 10  lines, namely Wanda Sykes and Andie MacDowell. Ironically enough, these two get tons of time during this extra, much more than they got in the movie. On top of this, I didn't even know Courtney Cox did the voice of the main female cow, and in seeing that, it feels like a waste of a big name actress. 'seems like she was expecting the movie to do better than it did. Keeping in the short featurette streak is An Animator's Life, probably the most boring of the bunch. The animators are stiff and keep showing differences between character designs that don't look that different. Having been interested in animation and character design for a long time, I didn't think I'd be saying that looking at something like this could be so boring. At least Method Acting With Kevin James ups things slightly- it's just footage of him on a farm with some cows, trying to act like them/gain inspiration from them. We also get about 10 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary. They wouldn't have helped the movie if they were left in, and are either in demi-complete animated or story board form. The Nick On-Air campaign is a series of little clips totaling 6 minutes, and are mostly trailers, but I guess exclusive to Nickelodeon. A lot of this footage is repeated from the previous featurettes, unfortunately. There are also the usual trailers, previews, a trailer for the game, music videos, and some DVD-ROM features (mostly games).  Before this year, I wasn't heartless or anything regarding family movies. But after seeing many disasters, and now Barnyard, I could end up being that way unless something fresh graces my dvd player. Some other bad news I just found out, is that there's going to be a Barnyard tv series. Kevin James is left out of it, but I see that Wanda Sykes has signed on. I guess another lousy animated movie claims another victim into going for roles just to get a quick buck. Do yourself a favor and watch something else, or go do some kind of family activity instead. One that doesn't involve Barnyard. I haven't seen Open Season yet, but I can pretty much promise it's better than this 
 no wonder Mr Sutton was kicked out the country. We never should have let him in in the first place 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 Without religion it would be easy to see good men doing good things and bad men doing bad things.  With religion bad men can do bad things and justify those things under the guise of religion.  However good men can also do bad things behind the same religion.  Here we have a fine example of either.  You can pick which man you see here.  Whichever way you go it does not remove the fact that BAD things have been done.  That is the message of this book 
 I read this book as a part of a Chicano Literature course during my undergrad studies.  While I found the first 140 or so pages okay, I found the overall story a bit boring (educational, but boring).  Lest you think I am being unfair, let me note that the story did pick up again at the end and I do not recall ever having fallen asleep while reading it. (2 stars so far)  I really liked the use of language in creating the voice of the narrator.  It gave me the feeling that I was sitting with an elder aunt or grandmother who was telling the story to me.  (Make it 3 stars, bordering on 4).  So, why the 1 star?  Mainly because I did not like what I interpreted to be a thinly disguised attack on a straw man version of Catholicism and I can't rate it a zero.  I found many of the incidents in the story and especially the commentary of the narrator to be very critical of Catholicism.  I find it unfortunate that, like most critics of Catholicism, Castillo critizes/attacks a straw man version of Catholicism rather than the real thing.  In an interview the author was asked about fact checking in works of fiction (specifically in her book "Massacre of the Dreamers"), Castillo answered:  "No. There isn't any point in it. It's your opinion. It's your reflection, your reaction, your own opinion. When you write a critical -- and this isn't personal essays, these are critical essays -- then you have to prove ever single thing you say."  Maybe that's why she chose to attack a straw man rather than the real thing 
 As a Bowie fan, I know quite a few stories behind Bowie songs. Unfortunately, this book tells very few of them. The title is a misnomer for what is actually another annotated discography to rival with Roy Carr  and Charles Shaar Murray's "David Bowie, An Illustrated Record"  (which, having been published in 1981, covers exactly the same period) and  David Buckley's "The Complete Guide To The Music of David Bowie".  Also, why did the writer choose to draw the line in 1980? As much as I  agree this is the most important period of David's output, twenty years  have gone by which shouldn't have been ignored. By the way, what the author  describes as "intake of breath" at the beginning of "The  Bewlay Brothers" has always sounded like David smoking a joint to me 
 Like a couple of the others who've reviewed this book I believe this book to be a poor choice to get a handle on Reformation history.  I think a more "timeline" type approach would have been better.  Instead, this work bounces around and throws bits and pieces at you.  Makes it difficult to "get your brain around" so to speak.  Being an intentionally short work he could have taken a few major paths and fleshed out their effect on Europe rather than trying to hit the highlights of so much.  A very difficult read for those without a decent amount of knowledge on the Reformation to begin with 
 This book is full of nonsense and open doors that get kicked in. Robert is not telling anything new. All he is telling is some common sense knowlegde your 5 year old kid can come up with. And then he repeats that knowledge a couple of times in different wordings. I regret buying this book and waisting my time. If only I had read the negative comments :-( I actually don't believe Robert and his friends. If they made themselves rich it's probably by selling books like this one and recommending eachother on the covers of those books 
   The south is blowing up quickly but the reason is because the real niggaz just took a break (Westside, and Eastcoast) but when they come back there will be a war to claim who is king.    T.I. will be one of many Dirty South rappers who will battle to the end as a soldier to defend to title and I will be proud say he is the best. (Trap Muzik) proves it, how ever this album is a disapointment coming from someone who took the time to buy, and listen to it. Please run to the store and get Trap Muzik, and I'm Serious I recommented it to every Dirty South fan 
 The GPS worked fine for a couple of days and then it never turned on again. I sent a mail to DIGITECHDEALS and they told me to send them the GPS and they would send me a new one.  The new shall arrive this week. Fast response from DIGITECHDEALS 
 If your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of "End of the Century" or "Filth and the Fury" THIS AIN'T IT!  Picture taking 40 hours of bad home video (really awful sound) and editing together and calling it a documentary. No current interviews, No voice over making any sense of the chaos...No thought to flow or storyline, just a mishmash of stuff banged together. A real dissapointment. The saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it, this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance. I've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due. Its a shame this is what its been reduced to. Shame on everyone involved 
 Why buy an expensive book about anime when you can experience anime on television or read about it online. This book doesn't have any new insights on the subject so I'll say again why bother 
 On the 3rd use this rice cooker burned the rice because it never went into the 'keep warm' mode. The cooker never worked at all after that. Returned for Refund 
 I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.  
 The humidifier started leaking after a few weeks.  In another website, a few reviewers also had this problem.  The water overflows from the reservoir to the unit and onto the floor and does not stop until the tank is empty.  Very annoying!!  The filter has not lasted long and started smelly funky the third day of use.  It is also way too expensive 
 I didn't expect this series of books to be laid out the way they are. I am disappointed that the "notes" are simply a glorified glossary arranged by chapter rather than alphabetical. Key points from the book are not bulleted or organized based on content presentation, rather key terms are defined and that is all. 
 I was quite disappointed with this book. I've heard that the results in the British Health System after implementing TOC are quite outstanding. If it's true, this book doesn't reflect it. First of all, written as a novel, the backround story is not good. Two brothers are in a great fight and won't talk to each other because one of them is a TOC follower. Come on! I'm sure the authors's could've found a better backround story.  The description of how the NHS works is poor. The Health System is different from the one in my country, so I found it very hard to try to figure out how the NHS works, the different departments, the interactions, etc. From the TOC point of view, good for someone just starting with TOC, but too light for someone who has read any other book.  To explain the concept of a system constraint, the book uses the same type of analogy used in Goldratt's "The Goal" (the boy scout trip), but the example and the explanation is not good. The clouds built to find these problems conclude that the core problem of the NHS is the lack of communication between the different levels. I was expecting a more detailed analysis from the operations point of view. In the last chapter a year has passed, and there is a summary of everything I would have expected the book to explain throughout the book, all in one chapter, with insufficient detail. This book is good if you are involved in the NHS, and therefore know its problems, and if you know nothing about TOC.  If you want to learn about TOC Thinking Processes, I recommend Dettmer's "Goldratt's Theory of Constraints" with the main concepts, and "Management Dilemmas" (Shragenheim) with many interesting practical examples. Also "It's not luck". If you want to learn TOC Operations, "Manufacturing at Warp Speed" (Dettmer & Shragenheim). Project Management: Project Management in the fast lane (Newbold). 
 The worst book I've read (actually, I was listening to the audiobook).  The characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that I found myself YELLING at the tape player, "I KNOW, I KNOW ALREADY".  I couldn't stand the torture anymore, I didn't even finish it.  I have enjoyed some of DS's earlier work, but will not buy another 
 Hamburg obviously writes for a different genre, allegedly screenwriting. And while ascribing himself much credit, his prose falls largely flat. Many of the sentences read on a basic level, a recitation of his accomplishments, marginal people he met, and esoteric details that are painful to dig through. For the Stone fan, an interesting read, for the average person, it has its moments. But its material, and its potential, is so much greater than what Hamburg delivers. For all the material possible, the book delivers flat. It's not worth the money and not really worth the time. It often reads as Hamburg's diary entries, with most chapters being a scant three or four pages, rather than a real story about great opportunities and fascinating characters. Hamburg is also a constant name-dropper, for almost no discernable reason. It seemed as though Hamburg's insights were immature, overwrought, and full of snide commentary and self promotion. It's no coincidence that his career centers on the two parts of the country that hype both: Hollywood and Washington 
 The book is written in a means of propaganda, this book did not illustarte how Iran is danger to other nations? The author mentioned that state of Israel was in danger due nuclear Iran. 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 The Last Escape By John Nichol and Tony Rennell  	The story starts when a group of British prisoners of war are stuck in a camp named Stalag Luft IV in Germany.  They are then sent on a treacherous journey through Germany.  Many prisoners died and many became very sick and ill.  Most prisoners became so skinny that all you could see was bone there was no meat at all. 	Finally, they stopped at a camp that would end this march.  The name of it was Stalag IIA.  After many days the German guards decided to get up and move so they could become farther away from the Russians and have a chance of evacuation and killing for the guards.  Unluckily, this march was just as hard and treacherous as the first but not as quite as long. 	The name of this new camp they had reached was Stalag XIID.  The Germans did not hold control of this camp for long.  Russian troops quickly arrived and took the camp.  Relieved were many of the starving prisoners.  There was something weird about the Russians control of the camp.  They would not let any of the POWs leave even though the Americans were two miles away too evacuate them.  The Russians were saying they have to wait until they get permission from the government in Moscow, even though they are allies with all of the POWs countries.  It seemed as though the POWs were being held as hostages under the Russians. 	Then permission came fro the POWs to be released to the Americans two miles away.  Therefore the POWs hoped on the cars waiting and then were shipped too an airport.  Finally the POWs' destiny came they were going to be sent home by country on airplanes.  Though not the Russians they stayed behind with the troops that were leading the camp.  There they were shot because of surrendering to the Germans.  It was thought to be frowned upon if you surrendered, that is how the Russians were. 	Happy were the prisoners that were sent home. 	 I did not enjoy this book very much.  It seemed to go on and on.  There was way to much detail.  It seemed like one of those stories when you wall asleep in the middle and when you wake up it is still going on.  There was also no action in the story. 	The people that would like this book are people who love detail and like to listen to a lot of stories.  They must also have a lot of patience for the story to develop.  Do Not read this book if you are not that type of person. 
 Based on the other reviews, I was eager to read this book. What a disappointment! The decorating advice is the same as every other book: declutter, have comfortable chairs with reading lights, hang some art, put kitchen things where you use them, design your home for you, not based on decorating magazines. What differentiates this book is that the standard material is wrapped in New Age 'spiritual' veils and tassles, so a room now has an "altar" instead of a "focal point." This lingo might have some value in knocking people into thinking about what they truly want in a home, but if you already have a comfortable home, you won't learn anything new here 
 Last Minute Knitted Gifts is one of my favorite knitting books, so I bought this book hoping to find lots of inspiration for cute sewing projects.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with it.  Many of the patterns (scarves, blankets, dishtowels, a sarong) involve not much more than buying a large piece of fabric and hemming it. Some projects are not sewing projects per se, but rather involve felting (felted rocks?  Seriously?), or simply using fusible interfacing to attach fabric to things.  While the results of all of these types of projects aren't unattractive, I'd rather use my limited crafting time to create, rather than embellish, and I certainly don't need a book to tell me that if you hem a piece of fabric, you can call it a blanket.  As for the actual sewing projects--well, some are cute, but if you can't find versions of them for free on Craftster or the crafty blogs, you're not looking very hard.  There are some cute projects here--a darling felt bunny, a patchwork pillow, a hooded towel that would make a great baby gift--but overall, I think anyone who is interested in more than basic beginner-level fabric projects would be better served by Amy Butler's In Stitches or Denyse Schmit Quilts. At the very least, I'd look at this book in a store before you spend the money 
 This is just a general review, of all DVD cases. I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs. I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years, and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks, so DVD's is your only source of video entertainment. My collection grew to more than 400. I have been trying to find a good case, that hold equal number of title books as it does DVD's. But that seems to be asking to much, or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers, you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly?????  Then when you look at the furniture options, everything seems to be made for function, and not style at all, they are generally pressboard P.O.S's and nothing I would want to keep in my garage.......... I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions, cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied!!!!! 
 If you are a hardcore John Waters fan, you are in for a big disappointment. Where's the sleeze, John? You owe me 15 bucks! 
 I admit that I am not qualified to "judge" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO "stupid." I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.  This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has "got it" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.   FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.  Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.  If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.   I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy. If still your ego insists on reading this, then purchase as many supplementary books as possible, and good luck 
 This book has glaring errors in the chapter regarding Dr. Gary Kildall and CP/M.  The author trashes DOS as a "slapdash clone" and a "rip-off" of CP/M, which is simply untrue.  Tim Paterson, the author of DOS, is in fact suing the publisher and the author over numerous misrepresentations in the book.  Save your money and get a book that is better researched 
 I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality.  What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger.  There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like "Swim": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire." Or the artistic suicide of the last track, "X-Girlfriend", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long.  That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between "Machinehead" and "Glycerine." The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building. 
 First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan.  I love the majority of his work. Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book.  I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only.  It has not been influenced by what others think.  I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book. I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book.  What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get.  People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc.  This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read.  And where is the plot?  There isn't one.  This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round.  This book is a statement, that's for sure.  Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement.  I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently.  I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country.  That is wrong.  I don't feel that way.  I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises.  None.  Not like "Of Mice And Men" or "East Of Eden" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck.  Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book.  If you've read his bio you must read "Grapes Of Wrath" to understand why Californians hated him so much.  In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book.  One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved "Grapes Of Wrath".  Go figure 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 There is an odd conceit found in many otherwise intelligent people to the effect that as they're brilliant on one field, they must be brilliant in EVERY field, especially as other fields must be trivially simple in copmparison with the one they're in. Hence we see doctors losing fortunes in the stock market, scientists losing money in business ventures, a generally smart people making asses of themselves in every way possible.  Penrose' argument can be boiled down into a very few simple assertions:  1. Mathematicians appear to derive proofs in a way that is not describable in the algorithmic language of computation.   2. The only processes we know that are not so describable are quantum processes.  3. Ergo the way mathematicians derive proofs, and by extension cognitive processes in general, must involve quantum processes, which for some reason he locates in the microtubles of neurons.   Now I don't know much about quantum mechanics, but I do know a fair bit about cognition and neurophysiology, and I can safely say that Penrose is talking hooey from his first assertion on. He's made a very clumsy error in looking at mental processes that occur a level not open to concious introspection, and then assuming that because individuals cannot describe these processes, they are not describable using the language of ordinary logic.  Everything else in the book derives from that simple error- an error I'd hope a second year Psych student wouldn't make. If he'd shared his manuscript with at least one psychologist, maybe this would have been pointed out to him, but again, perhaps that's just that conceit rearing its head again; how could a mere psychologist hope to understand the work of a briliant mathematician? ;-)  If you're looking for a good book that will explain cognition once and for all, I don't think it's been written yet. Certainly not by Penrose 
 This PCI Post Card is barely acceptable. I bought this unit because time was very short for me. I needed to test a dead computer as quickly as possible and Amazon could get this to me quickly.   The card installs in the PCI slot so that the LCD unit mounted on it is upside down and you have to tilt the system unit backwards, hunker yourself down, and generally experience discomfort in order to view the code coming on the card. For the money one pays, it would be better to include a cable with an LCD display on the end which plugs into the card.  The worst point about this POST card is the horrible, misspelled, incomplete documentation. You might as well make sure you have several websites handy which list POST codes and explains their meaning and what action, if any, you should take. The documentation was written by an Asian person who learned English as a second language and learned it poorly at that. The vendor ought to hire a qualified technical writer fluent in English to write the manual. By this I mean a technical writer who natively speaks, reads, and writes English. Poorly done documentation should be unacceptable for technical equipment.  The manual doesn't explain what a POST code of 00 means. It does not list what corrective actions might be appropriate for a given code. I had to Google search for such information. That might be the best thing to do with this type of hardware, I don't know; I just feel that if a manual is included with the hardware it should be well written and decently comprehensive.   In summary, the biggest reason for not buying this card is the miserable documentation. Also, this card should have an LCD attached to a cable which can plug into the card body, making it easy to read the POST codes. This should come standard for the price 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 I was bored stiff reading this novel.  I think J. Oke needs to slow down and take some time to think between writing each book. I thought it was very unrealistic how quickly the two young ladies became friends considering they didn't speak the same language.  This action was sooooooooooooooooo slow.  I prefer Oke's more exciting books like the Canadian West series, A Woman Named Damaris, and A Gown of Spanish Lace. They aren't overly sappy and their characters do more than just hug and cry.  
 I bought this cd without listening to it because I love Nickel Creek so much. What a big mistake. MAS is just dull. In a world of exciting and glorious music, what a disappointment it was to buy this cd 
 Written to obscure rather than illuminate.  Effectively makes simple subjects seem complex.  Skip this and buy anything by Ansel Adams instead 
 All during the 1960s, when authors still appeared on The Tonight Show, The Dick Cavett Show, etc, the two authors who had the most exposure and most  proclaimed their "genius" were Norman Mailer and Truman Capote.   Both fizzled miserably.  Their dwindling fame will be filed under  "Celebrity" rather than "Literature."  Mailer is the  better of the two, but he has not worn well 
   To begin with humans, as a species, are not very variable genetically. Of this small genetic variation, only a small proportion is correlated with the geographical distribution of human social groups. This geographically conditioned genetic variation, small though it is, can nevertheless help in the reconstruction of human history as long as it is used to supplement large amounts of reliable information from the social sciences: social and cultural anthropology, history, archeology, and linguistics.   One thing that geographically conditioned genetic variation cannot help with is in explaining the evolution of cultural and social institutions within human groups. Social scientists discovered this a century ago when they observed that genetically very similar groups can show enormous cultural and social differences while groups that are relatively different genetically can be socially and culturally alike. Unfortunately, the authors of this book are not aware of this. As geneticists who know little social science they look for genetic explanations where these do not exist.  The author's ignorance of social science also leads them to miss an important story. Although, the genetic differences between human groups are relatively insignificant in themselves, humans have, at times, attached a great deal of importance to them. One product of this socially and culturally conditioned exaggeration of the importance of genetic differences has been racism. Unfortunately, the author's ignorance of social science seems to have rendered them unconscious of their own racial prejudices.   Readers interested in human diversity can find a number of good books on this subject. This is not one of them 
 Berkhof's work itself is an essential document for the thinking Christian. With much of what one sees going on today, this is put into even sharper relief. This particular publishing is the `New Combined Edition', giving you a lengthy introductory work as well as the work proper, topping it out at over 900 pp. But the publishers cast it in a small book format. You have to forcibly hold the book open to read it. I would suggest getting the The Banner of Truth edition but I don't know if it will include the introduction 
 I had rented this movie on VHS awhile back and thought that even with it's slightly "B rated" style it was a very good movie for the genre. Good acting, great special effects, and a top notch storyline make this a classic in my collection. I have purchased the DVD through several online vendors and have yet to find one that will play in any of my DVD players or computers. I highly recomend this film, but suggest the VHS version 
 I have no quarrel with anti-nuclear books or thoughts, but this book presents itself as "The frightening true story of a whiz kid and his homemade nuclear reactor."  It's not.  The author spends far too much time criticizing nuclear power and oddly enough, the Boy Scouts, and far too little on the actual incident that led to the story.    Silverstein's anti-nuclear slant is obvious.  Chapter 2 (sarcastically titled "From the Radium Craze to the Soaring Sixties:  Science Conquers All") is a criticism of all things nuclear, including Hiroshima, the Atomic Energy Commission, using nuclear energy to generate electricity, and the Cold War.  Writing about the Boy Scouts' "Atomic Energy" merit badge booklet, he says "Such was the pronuke slant of the pamphlet that it...was authored by a group of nuclear-power advocates."  (Who else would the Boy Scouts ask to write it?)  He continued "The Boy Scouts systematically whitewashed the many problems encountered by nuclear power."    Silverstein devotes nearly a full chapter to criticizing the Boy Scouts as an insitution.  He writes "The Boy Scouts have always claimed to be apolitical, but the group has had a decidedly right wing character."  He devotes a page to reciting a cynical poem that mocks the Boy Scout motto "Be Prepared" with lines like "Be prepared to hold your liquor pretty well" and "Keep those reefers hidden...when the Scoutmaster's around, for he will only insist that they be shared.  Be prepared!"  What's the point of that?  Siverstein also states "So shameless and enduring was [the Boy Scouts'] shilling for nuclear power the the scouts later helped the industry turn the partial core meltdown and mass evacuation of Three Mile Island into a marketing opportunity."  (He later acknowedges that Three Mile Island produced zero fatalities and resulted in the precautionary evacuation of only pregnant women and small children.)  The book is not about a "radioactive Boy Scout."  It is a critique of nuclear power and the Boy Scouts.  He of course has every right to express those thoughts, but I felt deceived and cheated out of my $13.95.  (I Google'd the book's author, "Ken Silverstein."  You might want to as well. 
 I think that Jessica Simpson is trying too hard to be like Britney Spears and Madonna. Truth is, she's no where NEAR Britney/Madonna status! Yes Jess does sing better than both Brit & Madonna combined together but I think that she needs to make something a little more original! The only album that I enjoy from Jess is Irressistable and the remix album. Other than that she totally sucks at making music. Half these songs are not original and it's pretty obvious that she has no talent at writing songs. If this album had a any orginality and showcases her voice on songs that are fit for her, then maybe I would've given it more starts. But for now, I suggest you skip this album and go buy Danity Kane or Christina Aguilera. And if you only wanna buy it cuz it's Jessica Simpson then download it! You'll hate yourself if you buy it 
 I have found that most tribute albums are lame and why not just listen to the original.  So when I first heard about the project of a tribute to Grover Washington ,  I thought how do you cover God, because Grover was like a God to contemporary jazz.  WOW! What an album! OK, nobody had to write any songs on this, but they all put their own spin on each song and did a fabulous job.  Jason Miles produced this fresh off two grammy nominees for his 2000 release tribute CD to Ivan Lins ( Sting won for his version of "She Walks This Earth" while Grover was nominateed for "Cameleo " ).  First the lineup is just stellar: Regina Belle , Gerald Albright, Russ Freeman, Ronnie Laws with Sounds Of Blackness, Herbie Mann, Tom Schuman and Jeff Mironov, Dave Koz, Everette Harp, Steve Cole, George Duke, Mark Whitfield, Richard Elliot, Jay Beckenstein with Dean Brown, Paul Taylor with Peter White, Chuck Loeb with Dave Mann, Chaka Khan, Greg Philinganes with the New York Philharmonic String Section, and Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Joe Sample with Joey Defrancesco.  If you'd pick up an album with all of these guys on it and it wasn't all Grover tunes you'd buy it! In fact you'd probably have a huge grin on your face and tell half the store about your lucky find on the way to the cash register. So now imagine all these guys playing their version of all these great Grover tunes like: "Just The Two Of Us" , "Winelight", " East River Drive" , "Inner City Blues ", " Come Morning " , " Let It Flow" and more.  I can see you smiling and saying yeah I'd buy it and you should. " To Grover , With Love " is magnificent . It's good. It's great.  It's deadly gorgeous !!   
 Even if you've never read a decorating book before, this book isn't one on which to waste your time and money.  It's elementary (do we really need yet another explanation of the color wheel)and glib (don't even think about doing a faux finish based solely on the information in this book).  I bought it used for about $2.50 and still think I overpaid 
 This novel starts out okay, but rapidly deteriorates into a maudlin melodrama of cardboard characters.  After I began reading this, I thought it seemed very formulaic compared to other Ludlum novels.  My biggest problems with the book can be put into two basic categories:  One - The man with no name who is too dangerous to let go.  This theme is well done with Jason Bourne, but far too commonplace here. Several times I felt that if the main character was this well trained, he never would have pursued his course of action.  Two - The reasonable female.  The girl is far too willing to accept really bad things here.  No convincing is needed - just imply cloak and dagger and the girl falls in line.  I started out liking the book - but ended up hating it 
 Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.  Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett.  Don't waste your money here.  You'll regret it.  This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information 
 In all, I think this story could have been written in about ten pages in The New Yorker, or some publication like that. Mr. Sierra simply took too long to get to his point and rambled about topics not relevant to the crux of his book. Because it was originally published in Spanish, part of me wonders how much was lost in the translation. Then again, that would only account for a better read, not a better plot 
 David Slavitt takes a choice cut of Greek literature and butchers it. Then slathering it with a repugnantly saucy Prologue, and  peppering it with expletives and anachronisms, he serves up this yuck-slice of literary scrapple and calls it his "translation."  According to the back-flap, Slavitt's translation "remains loyal to the Greek originals without confining itself to the literalism that has made many previous translations unusable in the classroom and inaccessible to general readers." On the contrary, Slavitt's The Persians is not Aeschylus' The Persians.  This translation is to Aeschylus as Hollywood's Troy is the Iliad... but more tasteless.  I'd recommend trying a different translation such as [ISBN: 0195070089] 
 I am a man who loves his classic rock, but I don't shun modern music.  However though, I just hate bands like these who add Absolutly nothing to to the music scene other than giving people urges to gouge their ears out.  This is just terrible.  Laffy Taffy is the worst song of the year.    We need some good music to come out.  I can't say that much, other than this stuff will be on it's way.  Read the other reviews as well, they all know what they are talking about, but I am just adding the back up, for the sake of power in numbers 
 I had to return this boombox as soon as I opened it because the CD player didn't work.  I got the new one in a few days and it worked for 3 days, then stopped.  It is heavy and cheap and not at all user friendly.  I have never purchased a product online that was such a huge waste of time and money.  I realize that it is an inexpensive, low-end item. Even so, it didn't even meet minimum expectations 
 This book was compiled with the assistance of many people (p.xi), and makes for interesting reading of these sixty plus cases. You will be educated in reading this book, but do not assume these stories to be complete and accurate. They are the equivalent of a TV show, meant to be entertaining.  The Boorn Case gets a fuller discussion in Edmund Pearson's "Studies in Murder", who does not discuss the story of a "conspiracy". It defies common sense for a poor farmer in Vermont to have access to a man in New Jersey! The main point is there was no proof of any murder, or that the bones belonged to Russell Colvin. The hanging of a Harvard Professor was based solely on circumstantial evidence, a first in America. The Judge's instructions were in favor of the prosecution (pp.105-6). His story about Lizzie Borden is in error. Edmund Pearson's book was shown in error by Edward Radin's 1961 book, and his in turn. There were no bloodstains on Lizzie or Bridget, and no murder weapon found. Neither were a likely suspect, except they alone were present. David Kent's "Forty Whacks" gives a better treatment of this unsolved murder puzzle. The Judges' instructions correctly favored the defendant. Any story about the "Black Sox" and Shoeless Joe Jackson should refer to Eliot Asinof's 1963 book "Eight Men Out" which covers this story better.  The Alger Hiss trial divided America, "but not along class or party lines". Hiss was convicted of perjury in saying he did not recognize Whittaker Chambers. But a picture taken around 1935 shows Chambers (under his false name) to be around 145 pounds, sandy haired, and with a mustache. Compared to the 1948 Chambers, 300 lbs gray and bald, they do look like two different men. See for yourself. Chambers claimed these papers were a "life preserver", but were worth little without his corroboration. And Hiss, unlike real Soviet spies, never left America after his release. There are problems with the evidence (p.316).  The book "Tainting Evidence" has a chapter on the evidentiary problems in the Jeffrey MacDonald case. This is mentioned on pages 435-6. There is no evidence of any payoff to get MacDonald convicted. One of the most publicized and yet unknown case is the OJ Trial. The limousine driver picked him up at 11pm and drove him to the airport. OJ could not have personally murdered his ex-wife and the visiting waiter. The Medical Examiner who did the autopsies testified that the forensic evidence said they were murdered after 11pm. [The red, liquid blood suggests murder after 11:30pm, just before the bodies were found.] These facts trump manufactured evidence like the planted glove and fabricated blood evidence. In June 1996 the Los Angeles Times reported that the lead detective took away blood samples of the victims before the evidence was turned in for DNA testing. O.J. Simpson escaped the fate of Dr. Sam Shepard (or Tom Mooney). Isn't it true that murders by organized crime are rarely solved by the police? 
 ... until two thirds of the way through it limps on withouit a credible resolution and turns in to a cross between Star Trek, Dead Ringers and The Invisible Man. With a better 3rd act this could have been great. The guy can write 
 This book is the exact type you don't want your child to read. My sister read this book and she asked me some awkward questions from the book. It told her that the facts wasn't true but she was  still scared. This was the worst book in the series, and I think Barbara Park has lost the skill. DON'T BUY IT!- if you really want to read it to find out, check it out from a local library and read it before buying it. 
 It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport.  I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.  If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.  Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad.. 
 After consuming everything Hillerman has written, and learning something new about Native American culture from each book, and after Hillerman's squib on the Dust jacket, my expectations were set so far above what this trite book delivered that even two stars seems kind... As a 1/8 Arapaho [& 1/8 Blackfoot] i had hoped to learn something about their life.  The characterizations were also paper thin, including both the male and female protagonists... and the denouement was telegraphed for miles... ergo, even as a mystery/suspense novel, this one flunked 
 Never would have bought them if I'd realized they looked like switchblade knives.  Poor choice on my part... 
 I have bought this book in order to find a usfull guide in sleight of hand...instead I have gotten a lot of unusfull text with ONLY 57 illustration.  Think twise before bying this book 
 I continually hear nothing but how great and gifted a musician John was but when I finally hear his music, I wonder what all the talk is about.  Nothing but cacophony here. If you like the sound of several musicians each listening only to his own instrument, then you will like this. Otherwise, you will probably consider this to be pure tripe. I'll stick to more conventional music 
 If I hear that phrase one more time I'm going to scream! The character of Elayna says it way to often!  But considering she acts like a snotty high school girl I suppose it's appropriate. I expected much more from Cathy Hanauer.  This is the first book I've read of hers and I am accutely disapointed.  The character behaves like a spoiled brat, ignoring the potential danger that her daughter may be in and drolling over a young man instead of working on her marriage. It's a story that's been told a hundred times before and Cathy Hanauer didn't add anything new.  The writing was fine but the story line was a yawn 
 I too read this book cover to cover with high hopes for success.  I took notes and paid extra attention on how to perform each technique.  When a particular therapy had more than one technique I tried the first with no improvement and worked my way onto the next and still I saw nothing.  I got no immediate results as promised and no results still.  I've been very disappointed with this book 
 The movie itself was ok, especially Freddie bartholomew' acting.  But Spencer Tracy gave a horrible performance.  I sure hope he didn't win any awards for this.  He doesn't even come close to a Portugese accent, or any other kind of accent for that matter.  Spencer Tracy's take on a Portugeese accent is to talk in broken english.  Like they used to portray the Indian's in the old westerns. It comes off more as some sort of mentally deficient person speaking in broken english, such as 'Manuel no like you.  Wish you not here'.  It's got to be the worst accent in the history of film making.  And then there's the lack of realism.  Half the time there is no one steering the ship.  In real life, someone would be at the helm 24 hours a day.  On this ship, no one steers at night.  When the ship is racing back to port at the end of the movie, in the distant shots it's pounding through heavy 10 foot sea's.  But when they close in on the actors, the deck isn't moving at all.  They just stand there as if the ship were floating on a pond.  And at the end of the movie, when Spencer Tracy's character is cut in half below the waist.  He's not even in pain.  He survives in the water for at least 5 minutes with nothing but a torso and a head.  This is what really spoiled the movie.  The only saving grace is Freddie Batrholomew's portrayal of Harvey 
 I am very enthusiastic about exposing my children to different cultures and ideas, and when I saw this book and read the reviews on Amazon, I was excited to get it for my girls.  When the book arrived, I read it immediately.  The story and the pictures are beautiful.  I liked everything until the very last sentence of the book -- I was very surprised to read that Yeh-Shen's stepmother and stepsister were "crushed to death in a shower of flying stones."  Although I understand that this may be part of the original story, I am giving this book one star because it is supposed to be appropriate for children 4-8.  I don't believe, with such a violent and disturbing ending, that it is appropriate for this age group 
 theres nothing wrong in making thought provoking lyrics but man if this isn't watered down rap or what?.theres some tracks on here don't get me wrong but damn its too comercial for me 
 ......because I did!  I do like R.A.W., and I feel that he is right on the mark with many things he says.  But, my God, if I could only get the time I spent reading this book back.  There was one truly engrossing and suspenseful moment of the book when a guy (nope, can't remember his name) was on the phone with another guy (nope, can't remember his name either) pleading with him to get to his home, because creatures from Hell were trying to get in his house. The twist at the end was disappointing, and the process by which the author was trying to build to the climax was irritating. 
 You have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract.  The wire is very thin, so I'm thinking it will not last long 
 I bought this as a gift and my friend has informed me that after two weeks of use, a pocket ripped so we will be returning it 
 This nonsensical book has precious little to do with Isaiah, making very little mention of Isaiah while dragging the reader from Tibet to Hopis in Arizona. Braden's baloney name-drops quantum physics, a subject matter that, clearly, he does not begin to understand but does know how to exploit for his mush-minded readers. What Braden also understands is the mindset of so many irrational readers who are positively triggered by words such as "Decoding," "lost," "science," "prayer," and "prophecy." Combining all of these trigger words into one book title evidences Braden's marketing savvy, attracting the ignorant and the neurotic into a mire of mystery and mishmash. Even the brilliant writings of Carl Sagan do little to educate people away from irrational and pseudoscientific gobbledygook such as is displayed in this silly, silly book 
 Given the devotion that Gaiman seems to inspire in his fans, I'm probably going to upset a few people by saying that taken as a whole I found this collection underwhelming.  The short story format is notoriously difficult to do well and I'm not sure if it really works here. He's too good a writer not to have pulled off a few gems but most of the stuff either feels like filler (the poems and the Tori Amos CD liner notes in particular) or not quite worked out.  I wanted to like it, really... 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 Margaux with an x is about a young lady who seems to have it all. Beauty,Popularity and can do about anything without getting into trouble at home. Yet she is not happy she holds a dark secret that happened to her when she was young.She is tired of every boy drooling over her and wanting to date her and most having no content to them.  She has a gambler as a father and a mother who just watches television all day. Her life takes a different turn when she meets Danny. He is the total opposite of all the guys she has dated. He is a year behind her in high school he is thin and is not shapely, yet they both start a bond with each other. The book was interesting but after awhile I got tired and could not keep up with the constant bantering and sarcasm of the main characters 
 When I saw this book at the bookstore I imagined it would be very good, a train ride trough the continent!, it is really about complaining on everything, he should have stayed home!, I kept reading because I was expecting it to get better, but it really did not, this was the first and last of his books that I buy, I am sorry but as a traveler I expected much more, I could not imagine a more unfriendly person writting about travels 
 Overall, I found this record too boring to even bother using as background music. Background music doesn't have to be so bland. But there are a few standouts.  "Protection" - Gorgeous song. Not the best opener, but it's great. "Karmacoma" - Great track with not-so-great lyrics. "Three", "Weather Storm" - Okay, but kindda average and cheesy. "Spying Glass" - Same as the last 2 but also annoying. "Better Things" - Starts off incredibly dull but gets a little better, mostly due to Tracy Thorn. Lyrics could be less..dull. "Eurochild" - Pretty good! Actually "chill". "Sly" - Boring & pretentious. "Heat Miser" - Boring. "Light My Fire" - Really horrible cover 
 I can't discourage this book enough. It takes the interesting world of tattooing and makes it into a bland history lesson that doesnt even emphasize the more interesting aspects of its past. Tattooing is one subject that is generally vey interesting no matter how you study it but this book manages to make it boring. At times it gets so far off the subject you wonder why you dont just read a real history book instead. Very bland and reads like a medical journal 
 Really horrible stuff. Here's some history the book forgot to mention....  The U.S. Congress immediately passed legislation providing enforcement provisions for FDR's Executive Order, unanimously in both the House and Senate, provided under Article 1, Section 9 of the United States Constitution.     Only persons of Japanese ancestry (alien and citizen) residing in the West Coast military zones were affected by the evacuation order. Those living elsewhere were not affected at all.     It is not true that Japanese-Americans were "interned. Only Japanese nationals (enemy aliens) arrested and given individual hearings were interned. Such persons were held for deportation in Department of Justice camps. Those evacuated were not interned. They were first given an opportunity to voluntarily move to areas outside the military zones. Those unable or unwilling to do so were sent to Relocation Centers operated by the War Relocation Authority.  At the time, the JACL (Japanese American Citizens League) officially supported the government's evacuation order and urged all enemy alien Japanese and Japanese Americans to cooperate and assist the government in their own self interest.     It is misleading and in error to state that those affected by the evacuation orders were all "Japanese-Americans." Approximately two-thirds of the ADULTS among those evacuated were Japanese nationals--enemy aliens. The vast majority of evacuated Japanese-Americans (U.S. citizens) were children at the time. Their average age was only 15 years. In addition, over 90% of Japanese-Americans over age 17 were also citizens of Japan (dual citizens)under Japanese law. Thousands had been educated in Japan. Some having returned to the U.S. holding reserve rank in the Japanese armed forces.  During the war, more than 33,000 evacuees voluntarily left the relocation centers to accept outside employment. An additional 4300 left to attend colleges.     In a questionaire, over 26% of Japanese-Americans of military age at the time said they would refuse to swear an unqualified oath of allegiance to the United States.     According to War Relocation Authority records, 13,000 applications renouncing their U.S. citizenship and requesting expatriation to Japan were filed by or on behalf of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Over 5,000 had been processed by the end of the war.     After loyalty screening, eighteen thousand Japanese nationals and Japanese-Americans were segregated at a special center for disloyals at Tule Lake California where regular military "Banzai" drills in support of Emperor Hirohito were held.     The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Consitutionality of the evacuation/relocation in Korematsu v. U.S., 1944 term. In summing up for the 6-3 majority, Justice Black wrote: "There was evidence of disloyalty on the part of some, the military authorities considered that the need for action was great, and time was short. We cannot -- by availing ourselves of the calm perspective of hindsight -- now say that at the time these actions were unjustified." That decision has never been reversed and stands to this day.     It should be noted that the relocation centers had many amenities. Accredited schools, their own newspapers, stores, churches, hospitals, all sorts of sports and recreational facilities. They also had the highest percapita wartime birth rates for any U.S.community.  More history for you to consider regarding the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians:  Consider that of the nine commission members, six were biased in favor of reparations. Ishmail Gromoff and William Marutani, relocatees themselves, sat in judgment of their own cases. Arthur Goldberg and Joan Bernstein made sympathetic, pro-reparation statements publicly before hearings even began. Arthur Fleming had worked closely with the JACL (he was a keynote speaker at its Portland convention in the '70s). Robert Drinan was a co-sponsor of the bill establishing the commission.  Consider that notices of when and where hearings were to be held were not made known to the general, non-Japanese public.  Consider that witnesses who gave testimony were not sworn to tell the truth.   Consider that witnesses who were pro-reparation were carefully coached in their testimony in "mock hearings" beforehand.  Consider that witnesses against reparation were harassed and drowned out by foot-stomping Japanese claques, that the commission members themselves ridiculed and badgered these same witnesses.  Consider that not one historian was asked to testify before the commission, that intelligence reports and position papers contrary to reparations were deliberately ignored.   Consider that as a result of the above, the United States Department of Justice objected strongly to the findings of the commission.  Lastly while we've all been educated on the doctrines associated with the rise of Nazism, I would be curious to know if courses are provided teaching the history of the doctrines of Japanese militarism, a belief system similar and equally as insidious as Nazism?  Any clasess on the kokutai? Hakko Ichiu? Any reading of Kokutai no Hongi? Shimin to Michi? The role of Nichiren Buddhism and Japanese "Language Schools" in teaching these doctines of Japanese racial superiorty to ethnic Japanese colonies throughout the word prior to Pearl Harbor?  Those of you learning this history at your public schools and universities should understand you are being taught an extemely biased and partial version of what really happened and why. I would urge you to go beyond the politically correct version of this history as propagated by the Japanese-American reparations movement.  Your taxdollars going to these folks to brainwash your kids.... Be very concerned...  http://www.library.ca.gov/cclpep/index.cfm#admi 
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 I enjoyed the story of Chi Chi Rodriguez and how he over came illness & poverty, however, I lost interest when I read vulgar quotes from a gay recording mogul. I should not have to pay to be offended. I will not buy anything from these authors again 
 I had bought this book, and for a time I was enjoying it.  Then I came across another book I bought, "Disney, The Mouse Betrayed" and I  became so very upset about learning about the true Michael Einser, and what  was not said in this book, that I returned this book, very disappointed  with this man, and the damage he had and has done to the Kingdom so many of  us love so very much. :- 
 I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.   The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad.  * Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D.  * Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B  * Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.  * Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C.  * No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F.  * Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great.   * Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and "A" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why??  * Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year.  In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.  If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you. 
 After hearing so much about this book, I was expecting something really informative but what I got instead was a book talking about America's federal debt for 300 pp.--BORING and NOTHING NEW.  As a financial professional, I can tell you that America has had debt for decades with no major consequences, and debt alone won't cause a problem for America.  There are so many other issues that are more problematic such as free trade and its devastating consequences, America's healthcare crisis, the real estate bubble, the pension problems, the global oil shortage, the elimination of the middle class, and the control of America and Washington by corporate America---issues that this book does not address.   After researching the authors, I now know why their coverage was so limited.   They are not financial experts, nor have they even worked on Wall Street.    In contrast, the book---America's Financial Apocalypse: How to Profit from the Next Great Depression---does address these issues in detail and makes Empire of Debt look like a comic book in comparison.   The debt chapter alone is better than the entire Empire of Debt book.  As well, the author does a spectacular job showing how the government and Wall Street twist statistics.  There are too many topics to mention but if you are looking for a book discussing ALL of America's challenges with hundreds of tables and figures to back up everything, look no further.  America's Financial Apocalypse is the book to read and was obviously written by one of America's foremost financial experts.  The price is well worth it.      
 I grew up with this story - what happened?!  Somewhere in this grossly underproduced version they forgot that even in a kids story you need talented actors.  Kids know when someone sounds wooden and unskilled - and you can't pawn something as poorly done as this off on them.  They're smarter than that!  I could've done a better job in my garage.  "Under the bridge lived a troll..."  Come on 
 If Cass Pennant came up against 500 people with just him and his mate the 500 people would come off worse,well that's if your to believe this book.It's a good read but he does exagerate and it should be in the fiction section.Those Cockney's do like to bend the truth 
 But at the end of the day, Leach believes in scheduled feeding, scheduled sleeping. She's opposed to the family bed. She encourages  short duration breastfeeding for everyone, but her feeding schedule and her solid foods introduction quite clearly are opposed to breastfeeding for longer than a few weeks. It's great that she puts such an emphasis on sustaining the adult relationship. It's a pity that her strategy is so at odds with including the child in the adults' lives.  If you plan to breastfeed for more than a month or so, be very wary. If you plan to do a family bed, you'll find no support here. If you intend to include your baby in your evening, you'll have to go somewhere else 
 I had to get this book because my school required it but if I had the choice I would look for a better book.  This book has no answers in the back and a select few on the book resources.  The example problems are not very helpful  and the book is confusing in almost every way 
 I can't tell if this book is good guide for investing or not, but it lacks in a very important respect - mathematical credibility. Some of very basic statistics examples are just plain wrong, and with major consequences.  The first red flag was the error labeling the Y-axis in the probability distribution figure on page 8. This is labeled "Probability [%]", while any statistician could tell you that this is "Probability density", and in this particular case it is not measured in percents, but is a dimensionless [%/%] value.  Ok, this may be an attempt of oversimplification since the book is clearly intended for general non-technical audience.  However, this made me look back to page 3, where an example is given for calculating the expected annual return in a simple coin-toss scenario. At the time when I was reading it, I thought there is something fishy in this calculation but couldn't quite put my finger on it.  Checking more carefully I found that I was right - when all four cases are considered, the annual return comes out to be neat 10%, and not the 8.17% calculated by Mr. Bernstein.  Well, that might be just another small mistake - these things do happen, I thought.  When I got to page 30, however, I found another version of the same coin-toss scenario, this time with a little complication (tossing two coins, instead of one).  The same incorrect method of calculating the expected annual return was used by Mr. Bernstein, giving value of 9.08%, as compared to the real value of 10%.  Just another minor error?  Absolutely not!  Because the author uses the two [wrong] values of 8.17% and 9.08% to argue that similar cases will increased expected return (see the note in p.30). A lot in the rest of the book is based on this assumption.  I'm not an economist.  Maybe this book have some real value in it. All I know is that Mr. Bernstein got wrong even the very basic statistics, and used this wrong results to prove some "basic principle".  And this principle is laying in the base of his theory.  If the simplest math is messed up, what are the chances that the far more complex calculations involved in the rest of the book were done properly?  There we don't get any information on what method was used for calculation, nor we get any data sets so we can check it.  I wouldn't bet my money on it!  I forced myself to get to page 60-something.  It doesn't get any better.  Yes, it sounds good, it sounds convincing.  But there are more and more tiny mistakes, scattered in the text, that leave the impression that the author attended a basic statistics class, learned some terminology, got some ideas (many he got wrong), and set out to write a book, thinking he is an expert.  Believe me, any reasonably bright college student will do far better.  My marks for the book are:  - Investment ideas quality:  UNKNOWN - Math reasoning quality: ZER 
 It's not like Van Wilder was very good either, but I'm a fan of Kal Penn so I wanted to see this. He's ok, but the rest of the movie is just not very good. Lousy script to start with. I guess I'll just have to wait for Harold and Kumar Go to Amsterdam, or whatever they're calling it now 
 Straight up: Dip Set is garbage. This album is no exception, although in comparison to all the albums that they released, this is one of the better ones. Trufully, Cam'ron has very limited lyrical skills, and it displays throughout this album. Although during this time this album was released, he was just signed to Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records (you saw how long that lasted). Also around this time, some of the Dip Set artists (Jim Jones and Juelz Santana) were starting to surface. They themselves also weigh this album down. I did like the first single "Oh Boy". Also the second single "Hey Ma" was good also. The album's hugh highlight would be "Welcome To New York" featuring Jay-Z, that was well thought out.  The album also has many low points. A lot of these songs like "Loosing Weight 2" shows how very limited Cam'ron's skills are behind the mic. Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel do absolutely nothing for the song "The Roc". Production is good, like the Daz produced "Leave Me Alone", but Cam couldn't pull it together. Just Blaze and Kanye West would also toss in a few beats on this album also.  "Come Home With Me" is average at best. It has a few good songs and a lot of skip material. If you're used to hearing Cam on albums, then you might want to check this out for a few good tracks, or download it to hear how it sounds like. This isn't one I could fully get into.   Lyrics: C Production: B+ Guest Appearances: C- Musical Vibes: C Overall: C  Favorite Tracks: Oh Boy, Welcome To New York City, Hey Ma,   Peace Everyone 
 Unfortunately, just like most books of its kind (histories of specific firms written with full cooperation from the firm involved), "The Perfect Store" is way too obsequious to eBay's official "party line", and doesn't engage in real, hard-hitting, investigative journalism.  Moreover, the book is severely out of date -- it tells you nothing about the last several years of eBay, and in a sector that changes as fast as internet commerce, this is a serious problem.  The book is well-written and competently organized, but that doesn't make up for the substantial problems with the quality and timeliness of its conents 
 Carnage makes his way into this book.  Here, he is a genetic experiment that has run amok, and is currently draining the life of anyone or anyting he comes in contact with, leaving them dried up husks.  One of the victims is Gwen Stacy herself, cauisng a horrid tragedy in Peter's life.  The problem is Gwen's death was foreshadowed since the last volume ended, so unless you're under the age of 3, you'll have seen her unfortunate end coming a while ago.  Not only that, but the final fight sequence between Peter and Carnage, is, as are the battles in the other books, extremely rushed, killing all feeling.  Once again, the cliche of Peter quitting and eventually forced to take Spider-man back up is also involved.  Sheesh, the only thing missing is yet another person finding out Peter's Spider-man.  C'mon, Bendis?  Do you really think the readers are THAT dumb?  Just because the book's for slightly younger doesn't mean he needs to dumb everything down.  Yet another poor case of of over-hype around Brain Micheal Benids.  Well, I wonder how long before Jean DeWolffe buys it.. 
 I made the mistake of subscribing to this magazine sight unseen. I received a very good offer to subscribe, that I didn't want to turn down. I thought this was going to be like a Better Homes and Gardens, or Country Living but it wasn't. This appears to be a good choice for design professionals. I was just not very impressed 
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 I still have not recieved the item ordered on 2/28 and today is 3/31. I will be waiting and not placing any more orders from there!!!!!!!!! 
 Most of these photos are in many other books. Essentially nothing new. Topped off by some serious errors- casualties on the left flank of Omaha labeled as being at Pt Du Hoe, Utah pics claimed to be Omaha, mention of  "cliffs" at Utah beach, and shots from the Southern France  landing added in without mention of their correct origin. A waste of time  and money 
 If you are using a computer with a recent version of windows 95, or  windows 98, the code in this book won't work, so don't buy it.  Frankly,  the publishers should have pulled it off the shelves by now 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 I found this book to give only a cursory overview to some very important topics. If you're very new to computer security, and for that matter computers and IT in general, this may be a useful book. Anyone who has even a basic knowledge of computer security will not find this book useful at all 
 I attended my first meeting back in 1991.  I hated "the program" then, and I hate it now.  I have been cautioned that if I don't get a sponsor and start doing step work NOW, that I will relapse and yet, here I am, still sober.  One word:  GOD.  What bothers me about meetings is that many of the people who attend them are mentally ill and there is no one with any sort of mental health training overseeing their little gatherings.  In that context, exploitation of new members, dominance of the group, inappropriate behavior and contact between members is inevitable, not just an unfortunate occurance.  I became so fed up with being hit on during "fellowship breaks" that I just stopped attending meetings.  As a woman, I feel extremely uncomfortable when I hear female members talk about being "of service," as if women have not been trained since the dawn of time to be "of service."  I am also familiar with SOS, Rational Recovery, Moderation Management, Women For Sobriety and a number of other alternatives.  Considering my personal history, I was excited to get my hands on Kasl's book, figuring it would be an articulation of all the things that have "bugged" me over the years about 12 Step programs and meetings.  Instead I found myself being subjected to Kasl's seething rage toward white males.  Page after page after page, she continues on with her acrimony.  "We are all victims," her story goes.  "Nothing will ever change," "Look at what they have done to us," whine, whine, whine, as the violins play in the background.  She rails away, pounding her readers instead of "patriarchy" (this word must appear 450,000 times in the course of her book).  After finishing it, I threw her book in the trash.  I wonder if she has begun work on her autobiography -- "Victim of the Universe," by Charlotte Kasl.  I spent some serious time dealing with my own issues regarding "white males" and "patriarchy."  Yes, there is a priviledged class in this country and a great number of its members are white males.  Yes, there are plenty of rapes and murders and acts of sexual abuse and domestic violence, committed largely by men, some (many? most?) of whom are white.  The key to freedom from their "oppression" (another word that appears half a million times in this book) is to realize that NOT ALL OF THEM ARE LIKE THAT.  The "patriarchy" of today is nothing like the bleak, Victorian picture Kasl paints.  I got sober so that I could enjoy my life and participate in reality.  I did not get sober to immerse myself in cross-dragging martyrdom, or to catalogue all the ways I have been "oppressed" and mistreated by "patriarchal white males."    Kasl writes at length of a life-altering battle she had with caffeine.  Apparently, caffeIne ruins lives and destroys families the same way alcohol does, and what we all really need to do is watch less television and eat more lentils.    Her supposed subject matter (recovery from alcoholism) is used to lure in an audience, then trivialized in favor of trite, man-hating diatribes.  Grow up 
 I have read many children's books in my time and I have to say that not even a child would be able to follow along with this.  What's with all the dashes, arrows, and other symbols?  This only added to the confusion of what the author was trying to say.  My nephew, who reads three grade levels ahead of his grade tossed the book away in frustration.  I am surprised that dogs all over do not protest this piece of literary garbage.  This was definitely a book that one could put down.  What a nightmare 
 Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.  In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.  Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.  When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.  Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.  Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.  Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . . . He's so damned beautiful! And so cruel!" Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest." When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good."  Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . . . they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." "I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.  Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least.  Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it 
 Two of us read this book and we were both disappointed.  Characters are depressing and annoying.  The storyline is predictable.  We both loved John's two last books but fiction is not his forte.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing.  
 Perhaps useful if you own a large sailboat, but not very relevant for a lake-bound 23' powerboat.  Expected more diagrams 
 I purchased one of these when new back in 2004.  The unit has worked ok for me, with the main quirk being about once every hour or two, I go through a 3 - 5 minute period of bad reception, presumably as it shifts from one satelite to another.  I was unable to utilize the fm modulator as it was weak, but went to a hard wired connection to my radio using a cable purchased from Crutchfield.    My main issue with this unit is that there are newer units available for the same or slightly more money, which have replay options and better displays.  I would consider those options before purchasing this unit 
 When I heard that Laura Powers was simular to Loreena Mckennit I rushed to get this cd.  I was very disappointed. Laura Powers Has a lovely voice and the songs are good, but she can't compare with Loreena Mckennit and Enya.  She lacks Enya and Loreena's surrealistic sound and Loreena's incredable instrumentation. When you Listen to Enya you feel like you have passed part way into the otherworld. When you listen to Loreena you feel like you have stepped back into the ancient world of mystics, Shamens and exotic lands.  Laura, although her music is soothing, provides no enchantment. Overall I would not recommend this Cd to anyone 
 I had been a Smashing Pumpkins fan for 10 years. I formerlly collected every CD that ever existed. I've met James Iha, Jimmy Chamberlain, and even Billy Corgan. I want to tell you the truth. This is the worst album that ever existed. The OLD Billy Corgan is NO MORE. The OLD James Iha is NO MORE. Every member of the Smashing Pumpkins has found their happiness elsewhere. D'arcy Wretzky is riding horses at a ranch in Michigan. True happiness in retirement. Jimmy is married and has a child. James Iha has friends with young admirers and enjoys DJing over music. Billy Corgan found God and made TheFutureEmbrace and will revive The Smashing Pumpkins in it's truest form -- Happinness leads to God leads to Fulfillment. Think wisely before investing in this CD for your extrovertive and creative Teenager. Give him or her a positive outlet. Look to Jimmy Hendrix, The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, The Beatles, David Bowie, Culture Club (pre-1985) and maybe even Sheryl Crow. Wait until the NEW Smashing Pumpkins arrives. Then you'll see the magic that awaits with the Pumpkin revival 
  How can you not relate to Ludacris's music? It deals with every day life like chilin in da hood and slapin da bitchis an hos. It's so deep. I can identify with his music so much it's scary. i sure hope one day I can become a musical genious like him. Forget about no-name bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, and Radiohead, they're never played on MTV so saying that they're talented is like saying Ashlee Simpson didn't create rock n' roll! Ludacris-the most talented musician on the planet-is going to change the world!!!                                                                                                           If you took any of that seriously, this album is for you 
 Perhaps I bought this book for the wrong reason, or was seduced by the title and marketing spiel. I train UK crisis negotiators and was hoping to get some different angles on how to understand and influence behaviour in crisis subjects. I didn't get any. That's not to say that this wouldn't be a good book for the niche market it seems to be targeting - jury selection advisors in the US legal system. It's easy to read, though often self-congratulatory in tone and extemely subjective in the conclusions it offers. Nothing scientific here 
 The author's message, in essence, is that working mothers are not "real" mothers. I can only assume that in the sequel to this sexist, essentialist rant, she will reveal how working fathers are not "real" fathers, and how they should build *their* careers around parenthood, and how they are sadly mistaken to think they could possibly be successful both in the labor force and at home. 
 Maybe if I was in a exo-biology class or some other acedemic pursuit, it would have held a little more merit. But as a casual reader, it was DRY and uninteresting. I couldn't even force myself through the first chapter, I was falling asleep. boring. get Ascent of Wonder instead! 
 I have used this ice cream maker 4 times and on the 4th time the metal pin that turns the paddle broke. I find that the metal pin only goes into the plastic paddle about 3 inches.  The ice cream froze on the sides of the bucket and the plastic paddle couldn't turn the frozen  cream causing the paddle to crumble.  I would not recommend this to any  one as it is cheaply made 
 I defenitly agree with all of the others. Some of the stories were good... Like 3 or 4... the Sarah Dessen one, Sarah Mylnowksi one, Sonya Sones and Megan McCafferty's own also the Interview one and maybe one or two others. Others were complete and utter crap. Like others said... sometimes i didnt even know if the characters were girls or boys and some of them were just plain wierd. I recommend borrowing it from the library and reading only the stories you want... this isnt a good book to read cover to cover. I guess ive lost so respect for Megan McCafferty on this one. This is defenitely not a good present for a soon to be sixteen year old 
 I was disappointed when reading this book.  I am an avid Diana Palmer fan, but this story kept jumping around, and not enough on the two main characters.  Usually, Mrs. Palmer has me hooked by the second chapter, and can not wait to see what happens next. With, After Midnight, I kept looking to see how many more chapters were left, so I could start another book.  Hopefully, A Hero's Kiss (to be published later), will be much better 
 I thought I was getting a paper back text also, I wrote to the seller twice and they said the text is in the cd rom, this means my son has to carry his lap top to school all the time, I would have never bought it, if I did more homework, next semester this Amazon stuff is not worth it, I am just going to pay extra from the book store at College so I know what I am getting!!! 
 Thanks to the other reviewer for the heads-up on the copy control. I've had too much trouble with it, so I avoid CDs with copy control. This near-criminal practice should be banned, or at least we should be informed by the seller, since it makes CDs essentially useless for those of us who listen to all of our music on our computers or MP3 players 
 Oh puleaseee! Give me a break. Save your money. I was a police dispatcher, and this book is not some greatly awaited inside look into police vocabulary.  Most of what cops really say cannot be put in print, and they sure as heck wouldn't put it there for liability purposes. Most agencies use code speak, and that varies from agency to agency. If you want to learn signal and ten code be prepared to memorize about 200 of 'em. 10-54 on this 10-26 
 While this series is cute, and useful to get a flavor of the differences between schools, it cannot be used to compare schools "apples to apples".  The comments themselves are revealing of the character of a school, but the actual grades are meaningless, particularly when assessing academic quality - the consequence of subjective methodology since the students themselves (who know only their institution)give out the grades. They simply don't have the information necessary to assess their school against peer institutions in an objective way.  So yes, use it for entertainment, but don't make decisions based on this flawed research methodology:  visit, interview, form your own opinion 
 As an amateur trying to learn more about canine agression, I was actually quite disappointed with the content of this book.  Overall, there is no significantly new or insightful information in this book, and frankly, much of the information about specific types and symptoms of agression problems in dogs can be had for free, often in better detail and more scientifically presented, on the internet, particularly if one searches for information generated by professionals in the field of canine agression, such as scientific papers presented to veterinary journals. I DID, however, find the chapter on agression testing to be helpful -- I haven't seen this type of testing recommended elsewhere, and I did find it interesting and helpful to see the results of these tests on my young puppy.  That being said, I am working on canine agression issues from more of a preventative than a curative or treatment basis, and I would have to give SERIOUS second thoughts about trying some of the suggested tests on a large, mature, and seriously agressive dog.  To be fair, the authors also suggest a great deal of caution when performing these tests on older dogs. The vast majority of the book is merely a recycled basic obedience course book -- sit, stay, heel, come, etc..  And, while I certainly would agree that a firm command of obedience is especially important to a dog with behavioral issues, I alread have several good books on the subject, such as those by the Monks of New Skete.  Had I known that most of this book was just a rehashed obedience manual, I would have saved my money and skipped it.  Based upon the title, I just expected a lot more out of this book than I got.  For someone who really wants a good, in depth book about canine agression issues and their treatments, I'd say to spend your money on a copy of "Clinical Behavioral Medicine For Small Animals" by Dr. Karen L. Overall from the University of Pennsylvania.  Although this is a very expensive book (it is a textbook for veterinary students and also a reference book for clinical veterinarians), it had the answers I was seeking and was definitely worth the money 
 The ordering, speed of delivery were great, but there was one huge problem which ruined all the good points.  The wrong movie was delivered.  I ordered Honeymoon in Vegas and received Leaving Las Vegas.  And it was too late to return the movie and receive the replacement in time for Christmas.  So that was bad 
 I did not find this book helpful at all.  Very large print makes up this 130 page book as well as many blank pages.  Very little actually helpful information.  This book would not prepare you for the interview process and really has no clue how to get into pharmaceutical sales.  This book is HIGHLY over-priced.  It's a paperback and not at all what you are looking for 
 This type of machine just cannot make good espresso. Espresso must be made with a fine grind of beans, correct temperature of water, and high water pressure to extract the right amount of flavor from the beans for the right amount of time. With a quick/no-fuss machine like the Tassimo, some of these ingredients are missing from this machine's process, so the espresso turns out rather sour. Adding the latte milk covers up the worst of it, but it's not a great latte either. Stick with regular coffee in the Tassimo, and although it's not wonderful either, it might get you through the morning 
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 "Hey lets put Hugh Grant on the cover and maybe people will buy it." Well I didnt buy it for Hugh however, I did buy it because Fangoria holds it up pretty high. My curiosity got the best of me and, I wanted to know why they liked it so much. I still wanna know! The movie was plain boring! The script introduces one annoying character after the next. Its a huge mess, with bogus effects and, a major lack of suspense or terror! I wanted to find something good I may be able to say about this movie but, the only thing that comes to mind is that atleast it ends. Obviously there are those that get it and those that dont.. I am proud to say... I dont. 
 Al Gore is no more qualified to write on the environment than Barbra Streisand.  This is someone who flunked out of both divinity school and law school, folks - not to mention that he derives income every single year from a company that leases land from him that has been cited year after year for pollution violations. Hypocrisy.  It's like John Kerry writing a book on the simple life 
 Actually I pay for the book but it never arrived. Something strange must happened since I received the other items on the order. And its the first time ever something like that happens to me in Amazon 
 You know, it's too bad these reviews can't be weighted because there's a class of about 40 people with whom I took accounting in university that would trash this book. Make it 41 for the prof who stepped in and had to use it. It is not well written, with information presented out of logical order. It does not cover the materials sufficiently, nor in enough depth, trying to combine financial and managerial accounting in a book full of "worksheet" style pages that could have, and should have, been cheaply produced in an accompanying study or homework guide instead of built into a hard cover book that doesn't even have a lot of content to begin with. It's a waste of money at just about any price, not being able to teach the material, never mind at its outrageous price. I wish we could sue to get our money back on books that simply don't live up to standards. I also wish there was a zero star rating, or negative ones, which indicate complete waste of time and/or money, never mind zero value to purchase and read 
 AS I FIRST BEGAN READING THIS BOOK I WAS GREATLY IMPRESSED BY THE AUTHORS PASSION, CLARITY, AND HIS THOROUGH AND ENLIGHTENING APPROACH. THEN ALL OF SUDDEN HE BEGAN PRAISING VATICAN 2 AND "HOW BRILLIANT IT WAS". WHERE EVERY OTHER PARAGRAPH REVERTED TO VATICAN 2 DOCUMENTS. I TOTALLY LOST INTEREST, I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER FINISH IT... PERHAPS BECAUSE VATICAN 2 DISGUSTS ME, I DON'T KNOW.. 
 If you'd like a glossed over review of making a movie this might interest you but if you have any knowledge about the abyss, its creatures or the vents which have been known now for more than 25 years, this book will leave you disappointed. The few images of the creatures are poor, especially when taken by a 70mm IMAX which is 4 times the size of a 35mmm slide. The lack of creatures shown, the poor descriptions of them , etc. make for armchair reading that will put you to sleep unless you're enthralled by the California mystique of a director's name and little substance. I doubt I'll see the film either. When I buy something about the sea or other natural subjects I expect to learn something from it, not be poorly entertained. The references to Europa and its possible ocean are interesting but would go better with a book of some substance about its main subject 
 Peter Robinson is one of my favorite mystery writers.  I am now trying to get through the audio cd version of Playing with Fire.  The narrator, as I can picture him, is speaking with the spittle collecting and the corners of his mouth.  His attempt at portraying the characters' voices is pathetic.  He should just read it straight out as his "normal" voice is not bad at all.  The story will be good, I know, but have to suffer through this reading may not be worth it 
 This is a tough read. If you wanted an interesting book about Eninem's rise to popularity and behind the scenes dirt on how Dr Dre discovered and nurtured his raw talent, then don't buy this one because this book has NONE OF THAT! Instead, every chapter is a dry account of how Eminem's music affects American society, media and culture. Really dull stuff. He even manages to make the history of rap sound boring. I've read 18 books this year but could not get through this one. The author writes for Rolling Stone and it shows... If you've ever picked up a copy of Rolling Stone and were bored to tears by the over analyzation of music and its social impact, track-by-track, then don't buy this book 
 Boring and not much insight. Just a rap film, nothing about the true  culture of hip-hop. Some decent preformances, but if you want to really get  the real, check out Rhyme & Reason 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 Wow, how exciting that we were going to get a book of Joni's lyrics and poetry! What do we get? A book of Joni's lyrics and poetry.  No artwork. No commentary. No photographs (except for the nice one on the cover)... even worse, every album of Joni's has the lyrics included with anyhow, so if you have all her Cd's, do not bother with this book.  Save your money and look for her old songbooks (with wonderful artwork) online.  How disappointing, and what a slap in the face to Joni's fans from whoever threw this together. (Which is most likely what they did 
 I was disapointed by East. My number one reason being that i never felt any connection between Rose and "The Man who was a White Bear". The person with the most emotion in the book was Rose's brother Neddy, not the girl who was treking the globe in a search to find her lost "friend" who seemed to forget her a bit to easily if you ask me, slank or no slank. Not to mention there just always seemed to be to easy a solution at hand for every problem. I mean, sure there always has to be SOME solution but the way she got into the Ice Palace? *shrugs*. The story definately had it's good points. It was a breeze to read once you started it, and the journey itself was exciting (i loved Malmo the most) 
 This book is the biggest piece of literary trash I have seen in a long time. It is a collection of peace-mongering propaganda that seems to take issue with political reality as much as the author does in her own life. The agendas in her poems spoil the spirit of the pieces and make the reader resent the author. The poems are rather sophomoric at best, and are poorly written. Most of them make no sense; you would have to be inside Ms. Walker's head to comprehend her contorted style. It appears that Ms. Walker should re-enroll in a college level poetry class. THIS BOOK IS TRASH. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK--I TOOK MY COPY BACK AFTER 24 HOURS 
 I bought this off of the New York Public Library website.  What an utter waste of $40.  The book that comes with the software is somewhat helpful, but honestly there is no new information to anyone who has been collecting books for a while.  The worst part is the "software" that you are supposed to use to catalog your books.  First of all, it is difficult to install--this is always a sign of a inferior product: no product that was properly QA'd would be released in such condition.  Second of all, the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet.  I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software.  You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book.  There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data.  I state again: it is very surprising that the New York Public Library would include this product in their stores.  It is a major, major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there.  The product I finaly ended up using is one called Readerware (http://www.readerware.com/).  Readerware, for the same amount of money ($40), allows you to scan in the barcodes of your books--the software comes with its own CueCat scanner.  Then the software looks up the barcodes you entered, (using the Internet),  and updates each barcode with all the available info on the book. I scanned 800+ books in about 4-5 hours.  BTW, you can also use Readerware to scan in all of your DVDs and CDs, (you have to pay more to get the full version of Readware that supports books, DVDs, and CDs).  Of course, you don't have to take my recommendation to buy "Readerware", but please don't waste your money on "Your Home Library. 
 This book is bunk. Paul was not a feminist. Read Corinthians 
 When I had first heard of Dream Boogie, a 700-page biography of the late Sam Cooke, I was ecstatic.  Up until that point, I had only known of one other biography of Sam Cooke - You Send Me, which I haven't gotten around to reading.  I eagerly bought a copy of the book from my local Barnes & Noble, expecting an enormous gem of truth about Sam, that would prove to be both through and entertaining.  For readers of this review, there is now a third Sam Cooke biography, written by Erik Greene entitled:  "Our Uncle Sam".  Who is Erik Greene, you may ask?  He's Sam's great nephew.  But let us return to Dream Boogie.  Peter Guralnick is known as the definitive biographer of Sam Cooke, having written liner notes for digitally-remastered CDs and much more.  Peter Guralnick worked on writing and gathering the materials for Dream Boogie for more than fifteen years.  Therefore, one might well assume that he would write an enormous gem of truth that proved to be both through and entertaining.    Let us begin with the good points of this 700-page biography.  Peter Guralnick chose to interview a large portion of the Sam Cooke family, something Daniel Wolff did not do.  Naturally, Erik Greene did.  Guralnick includes commentary from his father, his brothers, his sisters, his business associates, his close friends, and most importantly, his widow.  Barbara Cooke, ever since the death of her husband, has never conducted any interviews regarding Sam for the past forty years.  Naturally, she provides a unique but also a brutally honest commentary regarding her life and Sam's.  However, Guralnick does not deviate from his course - he is still extremely through (to say the least) in the actual history of Sam's life.  He doesn't miss a single thing.  In my opinion, there is a flaw to this.  In the art of writing, if you're too through with a subject, you will bog the reader down immensely.  Guralnick gets an A+ on this one.  Throughout the 700-page biography, Guralnick succeeds in providing the reader with so very much information that is indeed interesting, but not important to the overall history of Sam.  He also succeeds in doing the exact opposite over the more important and memorable aspects of Sam's life.  In the 1950s, he stood up against the police in Memphis after the police told him to push the car to the side of the road.  Specifically, he told him:  "Sir, my name is Sam Cooke.  If you haven't heard of me, your wife knows me.  When you get home tonight, you ask your wife if she knows Sam Cooke.  I don't push no car.  This is my car, my brother ran out of gas.  I'm not pushing it.  You want to put a ticket on it, put a ticket on it.  But I don't push no car.  Not mine, not yours, not nobody's elses.  I'm not a pusher.  I'm a singer."  Sam then proceeded to sit back in his car, his brother came with the gas, and they left.  The police left them alone.    Depending upon your interpretation, this could be seen as one of the first steps for Sam regarding the Civil Rights Movement, which led to his greatest composition, "A Change Is Gonna Come", an African-American response to Bob Dylan's "Blowing in the Wind".  This also leads to another flaw in Guralnick's work, a complete lie over an important television appearance of Sam.  Daniel Wolff also makes the same mistake.  In February of 1964, Sam appeared on The Tonight Show and it's known that he sang "Basin Street Blues" as the performance still survives.  However, according to both Guralnick and Wolff, Sam also sang "A Change Is Gonna Come" on the same show.  I'm not sure what Wolff does in an attempt to prove this, but Guralnick uses a cue sheet with a similar title to "A Change Is Gonna Come" to prove that Sam did indeed sing the song.    I recently contacted a Carson archivist, and Sam never sung the song.  It took me a day to figure it out.  Guralnick worked on this book for more than fifteen years.  If he went through such work to that the song was planned, why wouldn't he check the log book of the episode to see if Sam sung the song to be completely sure?  During the days of The Tonight Show, some guests would exceed the length of time they occupied and therefore, some guests would never make it onto the show.    Perhaps that's not a very big flaw in the biography of Sam; it's only a single event.  Consider this.  On the eighth page of the biography, there is a picture with the caption "A very young Sam Cooke".  The eighth page and Guralnick makes a major mistake.  It's not Sam.  It's his brother, L.C.  Three months after the book was released, the mistake was corrected.  If Guralnick cannot properly identify a photo of the person he's writing about, what other mistakes is he prone to make in the book?  Perhaps the biggest mistake Guralnick makes is stating that the official version of events concerning Sam's death was how it went down.  As I read the chapter regarding Sam's death, I seriously considered whether or not Guralnick was employed by Allen Klein, whom Sam was planning to fire.  Who was Allen Klein?  I don't know too much about him myself, but I do know that he swindled the Cooke family out of the royalties of Sam's catalog with help from one of Sam's daughters and his widow.  I do know that he also conned The Beatles as well as The Rolling Stones.  That's about it.  Yet, he uses Allen Klein's and Barbara Cooke's commentary exclusively.  If you do a Google search about the death of Sam, you'll find an analysis of the "official" version of events that pokes five large gaping holes into the official version of events.  In addition, the coroner's inquest was a complete joke and contradicted itself numerous times.  Daniel Wolff didn't believe the official version of events, Sam's fans don't believe the official version of events, and Sam's family doesn't believe the official version of events.  Pretty much no one believes the official version of events other than Guralnick.    I'm not sure what Wolff does to debate what really happened that night, but Erik Greene includes a report in his book that is extremely different from the official version of events.  Well, you may say that he would naturally do that, considering Sam was a member of his family.  Instead of using the "facts" from the coroner's inquest and related events, Greene chooses to tackle the mystery of Sam's death via a pathology report.  Scientifically speaking, I believe that it's quite accurate.    Here's the rather discerning part.  Peter Guralnick is known as the definitive biographer of Sam Cooke.  But of course, no biography doesn't have its flaws.  However, keep in mind that I do not cite all the mistakes made in Dream Boogie.  I can probably cite four or five more off the top of my head.  But I think I've trashed the book enough.  What's the worst part?  The flaws in Dream Boogie, known as the Sam Cooke Bible, could be perhaps passed off as truth by a less-than-familiar (historically speaking) Sam Cooke fan, and are blatantly obvious to the die-hard fans of Sam Cooke.    If you want a good biography of Sam that is entertaining, through, and truthful, either check out Wolff's biography or Greene's biography, which I highly recommend, which was by a member of the family of Sam Cooke 
 I served as a Member of The Force from 1956 to 1967 and this is a down to earth piece about what ( MOF) went through. Jurgensen was a damn good cop.  Every former NYPD officer past and present should read this book 
 Don't buy this book, unless you have a copy machines that enlarges in your home. Very disappointed. Will never buy a book from That Patchwork Place again 
 I've been reading for over 35 years, and I can count on one hand the number of books that I haven't finished - this is one of them.  I gave it until page ~175 or so, and I just couldn't take it anymore.  I know I'm in the minority here, but the story just did not grab me.  I thought it was slow and lumbering.  I thought that the characters were undeveloped and stereotypes.  I did not like the way he portrayed women - there wasn't one that was intelligent and thoughtful.  The main female character is portrayed as naive and slutty (sleeps with her boss).  The first love scene was about as exciting as thinking about polar bears mating.  Actually, polar bears probably have more chemistry.  From what I did read, the plot seemed pretty predictable, although from reading the other reviews, it seems that the ending may have been a surprise.  Sorry, it wasn't worth the torture of reading this for another 400 pages to find out.  
 I can see this book really knocking the socks off of a Photoshop neophyte with little to no understanding of image processing fundamentals or color spaces, but if you've ever done anything more complicated than pasting your co-worker's head on a celebrity's body and typing some hilarious text underneath it, there's really nothing worth spending money on here. Mr. Margulis has taken a tiny handful of incredibly rudimentary and well-known retouching techniques and padded them out with a Herculean dose of narcissism in order to make himself sound like some sort of pioneering genius. His tone is grating to an extreme and as others have said, there's probably about ten pages worth of genuinely good information in the entire book.   Yes, Lab mode is there. Yes, it makes certain calculations simpler. Yes Photoshop uses it as its default profile connection space. But guess what, Lab has a great many flaws as well, and these flaws continue to drive the CIE to create successors such as Luv, LCh and xyY. And of course we can't forget about the good old faithful XYZ space which probably deserves to be touted as "the most powerful colorspace" at least as much as Lab does. Why hasn't Mr. Margulis written a book about that?  Probably because he has little to no idea what he's talking about and is just parroting material he's read on various free websites over the years.  Do a Google search on "Lab Color" and/or get yourself a book on color management if you want to learn something other than cheap parlor tricks. Round-tripping your images to Lab and back unnecessarily is one of the best ways to destroy whatever color fidelity they might have had, especially if you take Mr. Margulis' advice and throw half your capture data away just because you want to rebel against convention by disregarding things like easily demonstrable facts. In Mr. Margulis' world, photographers make such perfect exposures every single time that they have no need of higher bit depths or non-destructive editing features. Of course, if this were actually the case, they'd have no need of a book about fixing imperfect exposures, either. 
 In trying to get it set up, I went through multiple help technicians, most of  whom were difficult to understand   All that was accomplished was to mess up our internet connection, and then was told that my ISP would have to straighten out the problems Belkin created. One technician was honest enough to admit that the install disc was practically worthless.  Otherwise, it was nothing but a headache of waiting on the phone, being cut off, being shuttled around, and getting nothing done.  We did finally have good success, with another product 
 It is a shame that even though it was advertised, the hebrew text is missin 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 Strangely, quite unlistenable. The tracks are foreign and not very musical. No excerpts from the hilarious dialogue of the movie. Just an oddity to your CD collection, if you're into that sort of thing. And this is coming from a die-hard Borat fan 
 Unless you have a new softball glove to break in, this product is not for you. Way, way too much oil.  Just nappy. I might as well have put mayo in my hair. 
 I put this CD on my wish list before the preview tracks were available, so when I recieved it I was very dissapointed.  The version of Cool Water and Tumbling Tumbleweeds are just not the ones I remember--they seem a little to "speeded up".  In listening to some of the other preview tracks, I think I would have been happier with one of the older recordings when there were only 3 sons.  The harmonies are still good, it just is not what I remember 
 Some decent stuff, but he barely mentions ETFs, which are becoming a bigger piece of the asset puzzle. And his cavalier negativity of index funds (also mentioned in his prior books) is incorrect.  He needs to read the Arnott study in the Journal of Portfolio Management (26, no. 4, 2000). However, his points on diversification and rebalancing are on target 
  I couldn't even begin to count all the things Stanley Coren gets wrong in THE INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS.  For instance, in one section he claims that dogs have the ability to do math but in another part of the book he claims they can't tell the difference between a tug toy and human skin.  The first is clearly way beyond a dog's capacity, while the second is something which comes totally natural to them.  How did Coren get things so backwards?  And the "intelligence" tests he provides have nothing to do with intelligence but in how focused or driven a dog is to do the test (or game) while you're doing it.  For instance, I tried one of the tests with my dog by putting a piece of food under a towel, then waited to see how long it took him to find the treat.  I'd still be waiting if I hadn't decided he'd never look under that towel.  Then I tried the same game by teasing my dog with one of his favorite toys.  Then I hid it under the towel, and it took him less than a second to get that toy.  So my dog is apparently both on the smarter and dumber ends of Coren's intelligence spectrum.  (This is just one example, by the way: the whole idea of testing a dog's IQ like this is bogus.)  And don't get me started on Coren's pedantic retelling of the alpha myth.  Granted, he wrote this book before the latest research on wild wolf packs proved that there's no such thing as a dominance hierarchy, or an alpha wolf, or the rest of that alpha nonsense.  Though, I doubt if even that data would change Coren's mind.  After all, he seriously recommends rolling your dog over on its back every day and pulling one of the animal's hind legs in the air to create a posture which supposedly "signifies submission to the pack leader."  (Really?  Dogs use "signifiers" now?)  The funny thing is, shortly after reading that passage I saw a wolf documentary on TV and the papa wolf did the exact opposite or what Coren recommends!  He rolled over on HIS back and let the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose!  They loved it!  So I tried what the papa wolf did with his pups with my dog--an alpha male, if there ever was one--and HE loved it.  And later that night, on our last walk, he was ten times as obedient to me than he had been before I'd mimicked the papa wolf's behavior.  Again, Coren had everything exactly backwards to reality.   This "through the looking glass" quality persists throughout the book, with Coren even saying that dogs are capable of hypothetical, symbolic, and conceptual thinking.  Wha..?  I'm sorry.  I love dogs and I think they have wonderful abilities that should be honored and respected, but the abilities they DO have are geared for being a dog, not a mini-me with four legs and a tail.  For one thing, fully one third of a dog's brain is devoted to processing olfactory information, and none to processing symbols and concepts.  I think Coren needs to do a little more research on comparative neuroanatomy and actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like the ones he made in this inane book. 
 It wasnt all that bad. It had its moments. Brad Renfro (Bully), Dominique Swain (Face/Off), Keram Malicki-Sanchez (tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Emily Bergl (The Rage: Carrie 2), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), James King (Bulletproof Monk) and Jordan Bridges (Mona Lisa Smile, son of Jeff Bridges) star as camp counslers who have, well a lot of problems. Peter Stormare (Eight Millimeter) is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp. Emotions, relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way. James King (former model) looks good dipping in that lake..hmm. Renfro and Swain are so wrong for each other, they should be a couple in real life. Bergl is hot to the bone. Bridges is a bastard. Long is a hoot as a nerdy/geek type of characer and Sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others. Stomare is just weird, plain weird and the kids are brats. So if you liked Heathers, because Daniel Waters wrote it, then this is the movie for yo 
 A MOUSE LOOSES HIS FAMILY MEMBERS & THEN FINDS THEM.  IT'S JUST AN OK BOOK, VERY UNDERSERVING OF ALL THE 5-STAR REVIEWS.  A BETTER MOUSE BOOK WOULD BE- IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE. 
 I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism. 
 Where is J.B. Jackson when you need him? The spirit of the seemingly unbiased observer of the American built environment, who is said to have said that he never saw a landscape he didn't like, and who extracted a quiet poetry from the most modest, mundane, and - let's face it - sorry of places is strangely missing in this book. And what a shame. Regardless of what side of the sprawl debate you're on, you have to admit that some of the things produced by (and for the sake of) sprawl are, if not awe-inspiring, then at least wonderous. It may be ugly, wasteful, and dehumanizing, but sprawl is America's urban vanguard, and, for all the criticism that has been leveled at it, it remains true that, as Hayden herself acknowledges, "well-educated Americans often lack words for the cultural upheaval caused by rapid sprawl."   What is needed, then, is precisely what A Field Guide to Sprawl isn't: a scientific illumination of what's going on out there. The biggest (though unfortunately not the only) problem with A Field Guide to Sprawl is that it interprets when it should inform; proselytizes and polemicizes what it should explain. Thus in an entry for "duck" we're told not only what a duck is (a building that replicates and serves as an advertisement for the product sold within it), we're told (incredibly), that "while some Americans justify ducks as zany landmarks that help people locate themselves in sprawl, ducks are always out of context and do little to unify neighborhoods." In an entry for "big box" we're told, predictably, I suppose, that "big boxes undercut smaller, local businesses, causing abandoned buildings on Main Streets in older town centers."       Hayden is certainly aware of this criticism. In her introduction, she criticizes the American Planning Association's Glossary of Zoning, Development, and Planning Terms for "playing it safe" by "defining terms for zoning legislation in a neutral way." As an example, she sites the Glossary's definition of "billboard," which, in her eyes is too respectful for avoiding words like "garish" and "aggressive." Indeed, if we look up "billboard" in the index of A Field Guide to Sprawl we're told to see "litter on a stick."  A Field Guide to Sprawl is propaganda for the New Urbanist movement, plain and simple. Further evidence of this is the fact that many of the entries in fact have little to do with sprawl, but are nonetheless keywords in various (hackneyed) New Urbanist discourses. "Ball pork," for example, which "combines ballpark and pork barrel to describe a stadium built with public funds for the use of a privately owned ball team," is, as Hayden herself acknowledges, a largely urban phenomenon, as most new stadiums that get built today get built downtown. Ditto "theming," which, like "ball pork," is associated more with casinos, festival marketplaces, and other downtown developments than with sprawl. "Litter on a stick," "LULU," and "TOAD" are similarly out of place here.    But if A Field Guide to Sprawl is propaganda, what useless propaganda it is. This is the second problem with the book. It is poorly researched, and shockingly naive. Almost every entry in A Field Guide to Sprawl raised an eyebrow. In the entry for "manufactured housing" we're told that "manufactured housing contributes to sprawl because . . . units are often crowded together." In the photograph that illustrates the entry for "low density," we see a subdivision of about ten houses per acre (the intended subject of the picture), set in a landscape of farmhouses, each of which takes up about five acres (the intended background of the picture). Hayden's case against the "snout house" is that it's "difficult to see residents' activities since protruding garages take up most of the street frontage," and that it fails the "Trick-or-Treat Test," which measures how easily children can find the house's door. Moreover we're supposed to take solace in the fact that the city of Portland criminalized snout houses by limiting garage-frontage.      Moreover, A Field Guide to Sprawl is photographed poorly. Not only is the grainy, 35mm quality of the photographs mediocre at best, they don't do nearly enough to illustrate the entries. The photograph accompanying "strip," for example, is an aerial photograph of two gas stations. Accompanying "putting parsley round the pig" are some wildly colored plants lining a fairway. These pictures do not sing.       Are there exceptions? Of course. "Mall glut" is an illuminating concept and Jim Wark's aerial photo of a mall with "room to grow" is perfect. "Leapfrog," "groundcover," and "alligator" are also fascinating, but looking at them only wets the pallette. Granted, it's only a lexicon, but how about a few diagrams? How about some maps? How about some annotation? How about some history?    Hopefully, someone will steal Dolores Hayden's great idea and redo this book the way it should have been done (I nominate Atilier Bow-Wow). Again, Hayden's insight that "words such as city, suburb, and countryside no longer capture the reality of real estate development in the United States" couldn't be more true. J.B. Jackson, where are you when we need you?       
 The story, or rather the spirit beneath the schlocky presentation of SOLARBABIES is rather wonderful.  It must be veiwed in terms of its symbolism.  The kids are not following a glowing ball, they are following an ideal, a higher consciousness that we all possess if we can only find it.  The water represents a sacred nourishment that comes from the depths of the cosmos.  Most of us have forgotten how to access that nourishment, most of us have lost sight of that 'sphere of light'.  It's unfortunate that even the movie's director did not understand these meanings, nor did the producers nor the more famous, and over-paid of the two writers.  Consequently they all worked too hard to create another B-science fiction movie.  This movie could have been a classic 
 James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree 
 I enjoy this work, lots of fresh observations and connections.... but having read it in the light of recent trends in the e-biz world, it sounds thin and delusional...a lot like Tom Peters after way too much espresso. There ARE consequences from CONTINUALLY embracing change...and, in my experience ALL of them are BAD. I wonder on what real-world  EXPERIENCE Mr. Kelly bases his thinking. My advice, embrace chaos and change, but do it VERY CAREFULLY...because it will definitely have consequences.  Truth & Beauty!  -Bv 
 I've read many of the reviews of the sorely disappointed, and I understand their complaints since I've also experienced many of the same problems.  There are, however, some workarounds that might help some of the stuckees...  Regarding too-high-gain leading to static, I've learned through trial and error that the not-so-SmartDeck volume is fairly random due to variations in mechanical position of its head relative to the tape deck head.  If  the volume is set too high (or low), try plugging the SmartDeck in and out a few times, or reach your finger in and see if you can jiggle its position.  Picking an especially loud song while you do this will help you to know when you have successfully adjusted to a good volume.  Unfortunately, this workaround doesn't work for all iPods... although I can always successfully find a good position with my 4th generation 40GB iPod, I've noticed that the output from the iPod mini is significantly louder, and therefore, much harder to adjust this way.  Regarding the tapedeck-spits-out-SmartDeck problem, I've noticed that I only get this problem when the SmartDeck is cold, usually first thing in the morning (clearly, this is the tape deck thinking the SmartDeck is a jammed tape).  Try warming the SmartDeck by blowing warm breath into the hole where the fake "tape" is, then put it back in.  In cold weather, the deck itself is also going to be cold, so you may have to do this several times until the entire car warms up.  It seems to me that this problem has become less pronounced over time -- I rarely have to do this more than once nowadays.  Unfortunately, I don't have a workaround for the intermittent track-skip/FF problem.  I have seen that once or twice, though in general, that feature tends to work for me (both track skip, and track FF/Rewind).  I have a suspicion that this is another cold weather problem and a side effect of the spits-out-tape problem, but now that I have a workaround for the latter problem, I've not seen this problem in over a year.  Ironically, if you manage to avoid all these warts, the SmartDeck is the best-sounding adapter I've ever heard.  Plus, the auto-on/off feature is much more valuable than you might think (and no one seems to complain that this feature is broken). With the four other adapters I've tried -- two cassette, and two FM transmitter -- I cannot tell you how many times I forgot to turn my iPod off when I exited the car, then came back to a dead iPod.  Nevertheless, the warts are pretty obnoxious, therefore I must deduct 3 stars from this otherwise 5-star product 
 Interesting book, but more often than not the paragraph descriptions on relationships are pessimistic.  With an understanding that relationships are complex it would have been good to balance the summaries with the possible positive aspects should a relationship succeed. Theoretically more muddled than the previous books.   Not very uplifting but interesting.  Good conversation book 
 I looked through the excerps in the hope that this book might be one I would like to add to the collection, and it seems to me to be a waste of money...even though it only costs $5.  Invest that amount into "Uncommon Grounds" by Mark Pendergrast; if you are serious about coffee, I fear "Higher Grounds" will be misleading, or at best, quite vague.   Example: a quote in the book says that one coffee tree produces one pound of coffee.  True, but it should say that one tree produces one pound of roasted coffee...operative word being "roasted".  A layman might not guess at the importance of that fact.  One roasted bean is only about 15% of the original weight of the fruit that the coffee seed/bean is contained in.   Another example that will rub any person with any biological training and one which I noticed immediately: "Coffea arabica" should be typed as such.  This author capitalizes the "a" in arabica, and the first letter of the species name is never capitalized.  I know I'm being picky here, but this is the first impression I received from the book...and I knew my opinion of it would be downhill from there.   The book seems elementary and not worth the money.  Please try something else.  I cannot recommend Pendergrast's "Uncommon grounds: The history of coffee and how it transformed our world" enough!  You could also try "The Devil's Cup" for coffee's influence on global societies...just do not buy "Higher Grounds"!  Libraries exist for a reason.  
 The authors commit a very serious fallacy in this book: they assume their own conclusion. They start out by believing that there must be miracles, pick out certain historic events as representative "miracles", and then go on to explain why they must have been miraculous. This is a waste of time with which no serious and rational person should bother 
     This was my first reading of anything by Franzen.I picked this book up at the same time as I got "Corrections".I decided to read this book first to get a feel for his work,but must admit was very disappointed.   I found that trying to get anything out of these essays was like looking for a white dove in a snowstorm.Obviously,he believes he has what it takes to be a good novelist.Maybe he is well versed in the techniques of writing,but he doesnt seem to know what he wants to say to the reader.His essays seem to be an attempt at observation,but he can't seem to pull his thoughts together and present a conclusion to the reader.   His concern about the literary novel going the way of the vinyl disc or the rotary phone,reminds me that it is the message not the medium that is important.   Maybe he has found his calling as a teacher of literary mechanics and should just leave the writing of novels to the gifted who know what they want to say and have the fire in their belly to pursue that path.   In his last essay ,it appears he drifts somewhere between being liberal or socialist minded;and maybe that is the problem.He is not happy with the way things are,doesn't know what would satisfy him and can't suggest any solution.Maybe he should start searching out some people who are positive,satisfied and successful.   Oh well,I guess I'll still give "Corrections" a try.Let's hope I like it better than this one 
 I was thrilled when I first began to use this project - it's very sharp & very strong, crunching through small bones with ease.  However, the safety lock is in a bad place - it's small & easily engaged, and on quite a few occasions now, the mere action of cutting - when the lock gets sideswiped by the chicken itself - will engage the lock, and then I have to manually open it up again.  It's EXTREMELY irritating - I would call it a major design flaw.  If it weren't for that lock, I'd reccomend these shears to anyone - but I'd hesitate to recommend them now.  I will deal with them, and I'm sure there's a way to learn to live with them well (after all, they do cut beautifully, so long as you can avoid activating that lock) - but I don't feel there should need to be a "break-in" period for a new pair of poultry shears 
 This is easily the worst Sinatra/Riddle/Capitol record and I'm not surprised it's been unavailable for years.Sinatra wanted to record something with the Hollywood String Quartet and this is the result. He's in wonderful voice, but the material stinks and Riddle's scores are painfully dragging. He simply doesn't have enough musicians on these dates and the strings are headache inducing."Blame It On My Youth" is the standout, but you can keep the rest. The emperor has no clothes on this one  
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 Written by the same author as Cults, New Religions Movements, and Your Family, as well as Defending the Faith: A Beginner's Guide to Cults and New Religions, gives a sense where the author is headed with this prodigious "history" of the Church.  Although not an actual history of Mormonism, but more of a superficially selective journalistic survey of the Church, (its people, dealings and influences) the book offers the reader an enormous panoramic overview at the entire 170 year span of its existence.  Yes, the volume is anti-Mormon, it is negative and has no balanced view or viewpoint.  Abanes uses enflamed and sensualistic language from the start and propagates the same misjudgments as previous anti-Mormon writers (confusing the action of members with the doctrines of the institution, using enflamed and unreliable anti-Mormon sources as well as regurgitating old anti-Mormon arguments that have been dealt-with in scholarly journals and balanced histories) yes, he mostly uses only secondary materials and relies on the Tanner's as an authoritative source, and yes, the author has no clue what historical perspective is, but, one must give the author his due for the broad scope of the work.  He not only covers all the standard anti-Mormon fare (the Danites, blood atonement, polygamy, money digging, etc.); but current subjects as well (including the Osmond's, Steve Benson, the 2002 Olympics, Paul Dunn, Thomas Ferguson, and racism). I enjoyed the author's journalistic and creative approach to chapter and sub-chapter headings as well (i.e., "Bloody Brigham," "Big Trouble in Little Missouri," "Pride and Prejudice" and "Thinking is a Sin").  I like that Abanes uses the internet and listed URL's for reference and resource, I liked his use of charts (First Vision, Book of Mormon, failed prophecies), and even though this book would not be published by an academic press or a large well-known publisher, it was published by a distinguished independent publisher that was since bought by the Avalon Publishing Group.  Although the work cannot be recommend as a studious publication or an important work on Mormonism, the author does show that the Church as an institution does have a long way to go in answering questions about its past, its "official" vs. its "actual" history, and currently about its political activities, treatment of its "academic" members (versus the coddling it shows towards its more notable members (including general authorities) as well as its suppression of its own history that includes the closing-off of its records and library.  The volume has 436 pages of text, five appendices (one containing a helpful glossary of "Mormon terms"), 152 pages of notes, a small bibliography and a 22 page index 
 I was given this CD from my sister, who knows I love to dig into up and coming bands.  I was not impressed.  The only song I found to be fairly original, in at least the sound, was In the Woods, which I wouldn't list as the fulcrum this album turns on.  The remainder of this album disappointed me with its appeal to emotion that was trying a little too hard (as is the style these days), hammering out repeated chords and vocals that have that familiar deep delicate sound.  Now, I don't like Coldplay.  I don't have any of their albums.  I hate to say this, but it almost sounds like Levy is really trying to pull off some Coldplay covers.  Make sure you listen to the samples before you buy this CD, because I'd hate for someone to accidently buy A Rush of Blood to the Head Part II. 
 Chapter two is worth reading, and so is chapter three.  The rest of the book is unintelligble.  Capra's cultural and historical analysis and argument are logically inconsistent with "the new physics."  Furthermore, Capra offers no treatment of Chinese civilization and culture aside from exploiting pop Chinese mystical terms.  Most of the book is a grand exercise in equivocation.  I'm sorry to run contrary to so many other readers, but my opinion is that this book will not be remembered well--if at all 
 This book is not for job seekers that have been on at least one job interview.  The author covers 250 questions in 150 pages, which basically means there is little worthwhile analysis behind each question and answer.   If you are looking to regurgitate the answers presented in this book, be my  guest and use it as a reference.  But as a graduate student at Stanford  University, I found little useful information contained in this book and  would not recommend using it in your job search either 
 When he talks about stuff I know he is so far off, misconstruing and mistating, that it makes me doubt his discussion of areas I know less about.  This is basically untestable philosophy, which you may like of not.  But it is way far from new, as any of us old 60s folks can recall.  To paraphrase an old article in psychology: what's true isn't new, and what's new isn't true.  Read some neuropsych instead 
 This book, republished in 2002, purports to "analyze" Arabs, based on Patai's acquaintances in one region of the Arab world, Bedouins and shopkeepers, in the thirties and forties.  It does not describe 220 million modern Arabs in 22 countries.  The book opens with vicious characterizations of Arabs written in the 14th and 15th centuries, mentions burying of female infants (which Islam stopped definitively in the seventh century--is exposure of infants an insight to Greek and Italian cultures today?)  Patai did not know Arabic well; he generalizes regional vocabulary, makes laughable assertions, -- Arabic has no tenses? No word for "children"(?) (all languages with grammatical gender use masculine for plural, as in "mis padres").  And more... Patai claims that "Arab" fathers beat, whip their children to enure them to pain (!), discusses deviant sex, says homosexuality is more "liberal" than in the West (it is illegal and despised in this conservative culture, in some cases a capital crime).  He tells us that Arab women are viewed "like animals, highly sexed," who cannot resist temptation, that there is genital contact between women and their male infants (this is as weird as if saying it about Americans!)   He did not publish for twenty years, and even then, statistics are 1950-1970.  What century are we in?  What level of society?  Did Patai know anyone educated, sophisticated, modern?  In Cairo, Tunis, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut?  This is 2005.  Why is this book still on the market, dated 2002? The prospective reader should search out book reviews on Google so the book can be read in a context, knowing its deficiencies; the reviews are well documented, written by thoughtful people, not rants.   This book is deservedly called "the Bible of the neocons" and is directly responsible for emphasis on sexual humiliation at Abu Ghraib.  Like Bernard Lewis later, Patai cites quaint superstitions as current, uses past events to "explain" modern Arabs, and does not distinguish between extremism and the realities of modern Arab society.  I think it is the poisonous counterpart to Protocols of the Elders of Zion.   Arabs/Muslims as devious, abhorrent, and threatening 
 In Amazon's ultimate wisdom they will NOT return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in Beta status.  I ordered these in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain Splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone.  I'd avoid the Amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards 
 I only have one word to describe this video, BORING!!!!!!! Don't waste your money!!!  That is, unless you need a video to put the whole family to sleep 
 Now I know where Maureen Dowd gets her boring and rather idiotic rants that chic pseudo-intellectuals find so amusing while the "inbred" (in other words, dissenting free thinkers who actually do not just give blind praise to someone because of their gender,race, religion, ethnicity, etc.) hicks think of a reason why we wasted our time of this drivel.  This crap has been disproven by many professional men and women time and time again. It is understandable that some women are angry at how they have been treated. However, some of them are becoming what they hate. And it will destroy them in the end.  This book is garbage, pure and simple. It is this kind of stuff that makes people who can think for themselves realize this author and Dowd merely undermine their efforts instead of aiding them. Good job, dingbats.  Anyone find this rather scathing? Good, they can dish it, they should be able to dine on it 
 I've read a bit more than half of this book, and I can already say that it is probably the most RACIST book I've ever read. While trying not to make race a big issue in this novel(I think that's what Lehrer was trying to do by having a diverse debate panel), the author made the fact that Barbara Manning(African-American) and Henry Rodriguez(Hispanic) were minorities THE central issue inadvertently.  Every time these two characters are mentioned in the novel, their ethnicity is brought up.  Even worse, the character of Henry is a stereotype of Mexican people.  On page 111, it is mentioned that Henry's favorite food is a bean burrito.  Nearly every time Henry makes a statement in the novel, he uses the word "Ole`".  I'm still waiting for him to break out and start refering to people as "Essay"(which, I'm sure is coming up)  I think that the only thing Lehrer knows about Hispanic people is what he learned by listening to Cheech from Cheech and Chong!  I'm not even going to start on the fact that every Republican in the novel is portrayed as a Neo-Nazi-type of supervillan.  This is a book with weak characters that use poor dialogue 
 I normally do not review books, but I feel so strongly negative towards this one.  The book is very dry - there is an example at the beginning of each chapter to serve as a motivation, but other than that, the examples are very plain. In addition, he does not give enough material to work all of the problems. The examples are very basic and full of horrid notation. There are a lot of holes in the logic as well.  A plus side is that the algorithms are not difficult to implement with only a few notational quirks to deal with (but none of them have detailed explanations).   From a student's perspective, you should steer clear away from this one 
 If this book would have been completely "intact," it would have been one of the greatest sources of Japanese erotic life in my personal library. However, besides numerous grammatical errors (please excuse any in my review!), the book skips three entire stories before arriving in a part of the book which has no connection to the previous tale. For example, the book skips from page 146 to 243 - 274. Then it goes down from page 274 to 179 and then back up through 243 all the way to page 402. So basically, this book is missing 33 entire pages that never rematerialize (please keep in mind no pages where physically ripped out, they just aren't there). I don't know if I got my hands on a "bad" copy or if this is how all of them are. PLEASE, BEFORE BUYING YOUR OWN COPY OF THIS BOOK, FIND OUT IF IT IS WHOLE FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Okay so I thought this book was supposed to be really great, but when I read it, it seemed very outdated; almost as if it were written hundreds of years ago.  Also, I am so over Ben Franklin.  So, he invented the kite and the can opener. I think that we as a society would have figured those things out for ourselves after a while anyway.   I was looking for some good witty sayings to use when I picked up this book.  Until I turn 75 next year, I will not consider myself old and will not be using any of the outdated sayings or information in this book.  As far as an almanac goes, my arthritic joints do just fine in predicting the weather for me.  In terms of up to date information , I would like to recommend Player Haters by Carl Weber.  
 Well I have been a fan of this series for many years and have watched each episode over and over again.....except this one. After watching this episode for the first time I felt like the producers of the show were busy watching "Shaft" or something in that genre to come up with the downhill skiing scene, not to mention the horrible 70's film overtones throughout the episode already. C'mon, any fan of LW&C would feel sick to their stomache when viewing this episode knowing it was the last. But on a good note, buy it to complete your series hehe, it will look good on your shelf 
 There are plenty of phrasebooks out there that are just as good as this, though they may have fewer entries (Fodor's). The book starts right off with the wrong pronunciation for the letter o in it's pronunciation section. The grammar section at the end has no translations at all. For a beginner the arbitrary symbols and graphics in the grammar secion would be totally confusing. There are no conjugations and no noun plural forms at all. Of course many words have multiple meanings, and these are often left out, depending on the section of the book. Plenty of quantity here and organized well, but too many negatives to recommend purchasing the book. 
 I love the story of Tristan and Isolde, so when this movie came out  I was really excited to see it. But it was an incredible dissapointment. I guess I should have known it was doomed from the start, but unfortunately they took the best six or seven bits of the movie and stuck them in the trailer so I really had no idea of the depths it would sink to. First of all, none of these actors are any good. At all. They just don't have the breadth to play these parts. Franco and Myles often get so worked up that their accents go out the window and they start squabbling like a couple of California teenagers. Badly acted California teenagers. It's not entirely their fault; I'm sure they'd be fine if they were cast in roles that were less of a stretch for them (an example: James Franco is the only one in Spiderman who doesn't suck). But an ancient Irish princess and British warrior are apparently too much of a challenge. The other actors aren't very good either. The King of Ireland has an accent that is so obviously scottish that I kept expecting him to scream "Pass the haggis!", and even Rufus Sewell fails to do a convincing job with his part.   The screenplay is also bad, as is the editing. The fight scenes were blurry and hard to follow with way too many cutaway shots, and some bright person decided that the Irish and the English should have absolutely identical battle armor so that no one would ever be able to figure out who was who. It was utterly impossible to tell who was winning.  And I know that some people just don't care about things like this, but the historical innacuracies REALLY bothered me. I'll just list them. It is highly unlikely that the Saxons and the Celts would have been cooperating. Ireland is portrayed as a united country, which it was not. It was a bunch of tribes, just like Britain. The evil empire vibe just doesn't fit. "Dunluce", obviously Dublin, is the seat of the high king of Ireland in this movie, which is ridiculous. The high king's seat is at Tara, and Dublin didn't even exist yet. It was founded hundreds of years later by the Vikings. Calling Tristan "English" is an anachronism, since he was, in fact, a Celt. English refers to the anglo-saxons, and I believe the term wasn't invented until much later. And the Irish would have been Christian at that point since it was well after Saint Patrick.   The only good thing about this movie was the prolific shots of beautiful British and Irish landscape, but for me it was just too little too late. 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 I liked the peformance by the actress playing Isabella. Loved her clothes and makeup. The use of modern clothes and spartan sets in a production that has an painfully low budget doesn't present a problem.   Beyond that, well, I know the director is trying to make a point about the brutal suppression of gays and possibly the government policies under Mrs. Thatcher.  It's unfortunate that the sexual scenes and extremely graphic violence are purely gratuitous.  The actors playing Edward II and Gaveston are too pretty and resemble one another to a weird degree (intentional?)  
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 This gets my vote as Miles' worst pre-electric recording date. It's one of the most desultory jazz recording sessions ever made. All the tunes are done slowly to highlight Miles' lyricism, but everything is so draggy that he just sounds bored. Elvin Jones, a great modern drummer, is totally handcuffed. Also, the CD is a major ripoff (even as it was on LP): we get only 27 minutes of music (which, come to think of it, might be a blessing in disguise: the less of this music the better). For die-hard Miles fans only (and then to only hear him at his worst) 
 This book is very poorly written. For historical fiction it is extremely boring and the plot is shallow and predictable. The characterers are ridiculous. Hake tried to create characters that are endearing, but they turned out iritating especially the hero, Josh McCain. The O'Sullivans had a bit of charm, but not enough to carry the book. Don't waste your time 
 That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book. This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her 
 I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time.  
 I brought this book after reading the reviews of the many people it has clearly helped.  I have suffered from chronic neck pain for many years now.  I wondered if the chronic nature of my pain could be due to emotional or other reasons.   Unfortunately, the book did not help.  It appears that either this is not the cause or I am in the small group of people that Dr Sarno believes need counseling.    One thing I did find frustrating was the abruptness with which the book ended.  Dr Sarno concludes that some people will need counseling to achieve relief.  However he provides no guidance about the type of counseling or what sort of issues may need to be addressed.  I got to the end of the book with no where else to go.  I couldn't envision going to a psychologist and saying "I have neck pain, help me discover what is causing it".    I have since decided that this is not the cause of my problem.  It appears to be an intermittent physical problem.  So far my I've found that yoga and remedial massage have been the most successful in controlling my problem.  Regular yoga in particular often provides weeks and weeks of relief.  This book didn't help me, but from the many glowing reviews it has obviously helped many other people.  Mostly, I wrote this review so that people would be aware that it doesn't work in all cases.   
 My kids loved playing with this until it stopped working after a year. The warranty was expired, so because my kids loved it so much I actually bought another one. That one stopped working after 3 months. (The screen stopped showing a picture, and just went to blank screen.) I changed the batteries, took care of it, it's just not a good quality product. 
 I was confused by the many examples. Most of the times I did not see how they fit together in the theory. Perhaps I would have appreciate it more, had I known some algebraic geometry first 
 This is the only Heinlen book ive read and it will likely be the last. The story starts out interesting enough - the human race travelling through space in a giant starship that they believe IS the whole universe. Through the course of events, the main character, Hugh, learns the real nature of the ship and futilly attempts to educate the population of his discoveries due to everyone else's religious beliefs about the ship - the universe as they know it. This is another interesting concept, however, the story is marred with dull characters  and a weak ending. I would recommend this book for children in grade school, but not for anyone who is looking for "serious" science fiction 
 Let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic. Regardless of the fact that it didn't stick with a few key plotlines in the book, everyone still did a great job adapting the original Jurassic Park. Then came this piece of trash...  Whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book, this one just takes the brilliant writing of Michael Chrichton and throws it directly out the window.   First off, John Hammond is supposed to be dead. He dies at the end of the first novel. Secondly Ian Malcome is supposedly dead, or at least MIA at the end of the first book, and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd. There is no bratty daughter, and the entire premise has much more to it.  MOST IMPORTANTLY... the entire ending in san diego with the T-Rex... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies... did not exist in the book!   I went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot, a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist, and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off. What I ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page. Not only that... but because of the lack of plot, the dino scenes are complete over-kill. When you see so much of it, you lose that awe and wonder of the first film. When you see that Brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film, the wonderment is difficult to rival. There are no such moments in this film.  If you're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino FX, go nuts. However, if you're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline, flick off the dvd player and pick up the book.  Oh and one more thing... don't go NEAR the 3rd movie. They didn't even have a book to be untrue to. I can't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one 
 I bought this book because of the 4 star rating by readers.  Let me be candid....what the hell were they reading?  This book is simply insipid, implausible and a waste of time.  Get this for a premise....rich, geeky guy buys a major league baseball team called the "Connecticut Nutmegs"!  Nutmegs for a major league team??!!  Yeah, right.  It gets better....he has an incredibly sexy girl friend who stars in the C-list movies he produces....ok hold on to your seats, here comes the good part....she is going to be his star player on this MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL team!!  Why, because in college she was an excellent athlete.  So some buxom starlet who ran track in college is going to play major league baseball!!  Am I the only one who thinks this is plain stupid.  Oh, yeah there's a murder along the way.  Parker (author) must have pictures of the publisher having sex with a goat otherwise I can't think of a reason why it got published.              
 Filmed in 1933, this movie is in black and white, and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today's standards.  An accurate chronology of the six wives of Henry VIII, the characters of the wives are rather  undeveloped, and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important  religious and political questions around which the marriages centered.  A  good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story, but  the serious scholar will want to conduct further research 
 I hate this album because it is not of the sinister type of music I like. This album is a fool's work that has no purpose. Why would anyone in the 21st century listen to this? Let's go over the songs.  1. "Not Too Late" 0/10 I hate this song to no end! When I listened to this song, I was like, "Shut up, lady!"  2. Rosie's Lullaby" 0/10 That's the stupidest song ever heard. What the hell are these songs about anyway?  When I listened to this album, I have discovered that this was not the music I wanted. If you want music, then look for the great works by Nox Arcana, and pay no attention to this Nora Jones fool. Stay clear of this Cd, or risk scor 
 This book is "not normal". Unless you create some of the classes in it, its worthless!  Having to "prepare moves" and "stances" sounds nice but it has very limited use because ONLY in those characters can be used 
 Sorry, if one is casting for a MUSICAL movie, one should actually cast actors who can SING, not just actors who have big names. Sophia Loren couldn't carry a tune to save her life.  I love musicals, but this is one I do not like at all 
 I really had big expectations going into this series.  Reading the other reviews on here I thought that I was in for something fanstastic, but my expectations were not met.    Crying Freeman starts off with a lot of promise.  There's a mysterious charachter, a love connection, and then a destiny met-- all things that give the series a strong foundation.  After the initial introduction to the story and main charachters, the series falls apart.  Enter killing after killing, mission after mission that seem to lead to absolutely nowhere, sensless nudity, and you get an absolutely rediculous and humerous plot.  Before I watched this series, one thing that a reviewer said stuck into my mind "the charachters seem to drop their clothes for no reason." Boy was he right.  The amount of nudity in this series gets so over the top that you have to wonder why it was put in.  Weere the producers looking for a crime-drama or were they looking for a hentai(anime porn)?  The amount of times that the charachters just casually take their clothes off makes one wonder.    The sketching?  hmmm, Crying Freeman is an early 90's anime so you can't expect it to have the level of excellence of today, but some of the charachter sketches are very amatueristic.  There is one scene in particular that will make you laugh.. It's a certain decapitation scene in the latter part of this movie--look out for how the blood spurts lol.  All in all, Crying Freeman has too many flaws.  There is no build up of the charachter Freeman.  In the beginning of the movie, he talks about leaving Japan and moving on with his wife, yet, as the story progresses he remains a brute killer.  Also, where exactly does his story lead to?  The only thing that occurs in this movie is a bunch of run ins with rivals and a bunch of deaths.  Where is the progression of the charachters and their lives?  There's none.  Despite it's shortcommings, Crying Freeman is a VERY entertaining anime.  The death scenes are artsy and flashy, and the women (yes, I actually got turned on by these anime women--hard to believe) and sex scenes that they're involved in are pretty steamy.  I'd say to give this one a shot.  Don't go in expecting some Godfather bit, though.  Just approach it with an open mind and heart 
 I would not recommend this DVD for Salsa dance beginners who are used to the classic 123-567 lesson style. This DVD is only good for general Latin dance styles, not Salsa specific 
 Although the song titles are great, the music sounds very flat. these songs are all likely original recordings. If you want to hear the original sound and imagine your stereo systems as one of those old horn-type record players, you'll love this CD. Otherwise, find something else 
      Three kids whose parents have abandoned them are put at a place called Whitegates.  They escape and go down river to the worst place you could ever imagine.  This is where they meet the grateful Heaven Eye's.  They also met heaven Eye's grandpa who is a little weird and scary. The scariest things happen in the Black Middens.  They have to try and find out the mystery of the Black Middens, Heaven Eye's, and grandpa      The dislikes I had about the book was every time someone had said something David would write he said, she said.  He would never replace said with yelled or screamed or anything.  I didn't really like the end of the book that much.  I thought the book was a little pointless.  The ending didn't really have a reason behind it.      I would recommend this book to people who are into books about people getting stuck somewhere.  Also I would recommend this book to people who look at the positives in life.  
  I really liked the premise of a reading club, with the themes in the books interwoven into the lives of the readers.  But a few pages into the book, I began to feel disappointed.  First, the voices of each of the characters - Harriet, Nicole, Polly, Susan, Clare, Cressida ... sounded exactly alike to me.  Each uses the same adjectives to describe their thoughts and feelings - a couple of times, when I went back to reading after having forgotten to bookmark the page, I'd realize that the page I'd turned to wasn't where I left off - it just sounded very similar.  And then after a couple of hundred pages, I completely lost interest in the characters, as I began to see Noble preparing to neatly wrap up the plots.  I'd probably otherwise have given this book two stars, but I felt so let down after a promising plot in the first three-quarters of the book, that I think it deserves only one star, if that 
 A real disappointment. The characters lacked any depth, the murder/mystery plot was stale as corkboard, and the dialogue felt very contrived.  The author's first book was fantastic, very visceral and real. "Welcome to Yesterday" seemed pretty empty in comparison. Wonder what happened between then and now. Reads like a totally different writer 
 After reading the delightful Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this sequel was an absolute let-down. The novel begins with the great Glass Elevator breaking through the ceiling of Charlie's (formerly Wonka's) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the Earth. While beyond the reaches of Earth's atmosphere, our heroes---Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and Mr. Wonka---must deal with the malleable and voracious Vermicious Knids (pronounced "K'Nids"), aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes. Far worse than these beasties, though, are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless. Charlie, Joe, and Wonka, with no help from Charlie's folks or other grandparents, save themselves and a US spacecraft from the clutches of the Knids and return to the Chocolate Factory, where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills, returning them to infancy or beyond. Charlie and Wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites, who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters. At the end of the novel, the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the President.  In short, these three are the most tedious, spiteful, unredeemable characters I've come across in children's literature and I hoped that they would be eaten by the Knids or the Gnoolies or even the Oompa-Loompas as I read this book. As it is, they (unlike the awful kids in the Chocolate Factory) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last. Their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore, rather than a joy, to read.     
 This book seems to be a good beginning tool for those not familiar at all with InDesign or who want to brush up on their skills. I purchased this book for a college course in desktop publishing and was very skeptical. I am majoring in communication design, so for the last four years I've been using InDesign. The book wasn't of much help for someone like myself who's been using the software for sometime. Therefore I don't recommend the book for anyone who's familiar with InDesign.   The CD that accompanies the book is a great learning tool (meaning it's good if you've never used InDesign). However it is filled with errors. I've encountered several errors in the exercises that make it very difficult for beginners. I'm sure there's a better book on the market that will teach InDesign in a more effective, error free way.   So, to conclude... look for a different book. This one is full of way too many irritating errors 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 At least for my Sony DVD burner in my Powermac.  Completely unrecognized and bloody difficult to get out of the machine without a reboot 
 Oh my gosh! I could not wait for this book to come out and when it did, I bought the hard cover - waste of money.  The other "evil" books were great, so why wasn't this one.  It was one of the worst books I have ever read, and am a reader addict.  I bought all the "evil", "shadows" and even some of her earlier works, but this, WOW, don't quite know how to describe how disappointing this book was.  Also it's a good thing I like Kay Hooper other works or I wouldn't buy another of her books 
 Camera Obscura is similar, in an inferior manner, to Nico, of the Velvet Underground & Nico.  The band makes pleasantly dull "chamber pop" in the vein of Belle & Sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years.  Even their name is ripped off of Nico's last studio album, Camera Obscura.  But, as I said before, Camera Obscura is much worse than Nico.  If you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like, pick up "Chelsea Girl," Nico's first solo album 
 I'm usually not one to voice my opinion on something that I personally wouldn't watch but I felt I had to this time. This movie SUCKED! The whole movie was just bad. I read about the bell witch case a couple of years ago and read that Hollywood was making a movie based on the facts of the case. I thought what a kickass movie that should be! Then I started to think, a big name studio is making the film so it will probably be PG-13, and all watered down for the kiddies. But I was willing to give the movie a benefit of doubt. Luckily I waited until it came out on DVD and rented it first, I should have stuck with my first thoughts. This movie SUCKS! The filmmakers had an excellant source for a very scary movie how could they go wrong? The all mighty dollar. That's all there is to it, the studio wanted a PG-13 movie that was accessible to a large audience, even if it made no sense at all and they got it. Everything about this movie sucks, you'd think with the great actors and actresses they got it would be great, but I think it was more of a quick payday for them then anything else. The "surprise" ending was especially STUPID! Hollywood needs to grow some balls and realize there is no such thing as a PG-13 rated "horror" film. The sooner they all realize that the better we'll all be. I know some people are going to be pissed when they read this review so I'll say this. I never take my kids to any kind of horror movie, PG-13 or not! Leave the horror for the adults and we'll all be happy. I apologize for my ranting but I had to get it out. If you still feel the need to watch this movie, rent it first 
 Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language.  I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs.  Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years.  Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one 
 It doesn't fit - I got my size.  I don't know why it doesn't fit but I'm not taking all the time to send it back.  Both bras I got didn't fit.  Sigh 
 Lloyd's grandiose hypothesis/opinion/wishfull thinking is that "The universe is a quantum computer" For a hypothesis/opinion to become an accepted scientific theory/fact, it must be self-consistent, and it must make a good number of sharp predictions that separate it from competing theories, and, of course, all its predictions must agree with experimental observations.  lloyd does not bother to show that his hypothesis/opinion meets any of the conditions that would make it a scientific theory. For this reason, in my opinion, LLoyd's book is an opinion book dishonestly presented as a science book 
 120 thread count is never a good choice. This set feels more like 20 thread count. I ended up using the fitted sheet as a box spring cover and made curtains out of the flat sheet. Don't buy this 
 The dynamic Root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children's comedy.  My advice to Root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash.  The only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of the child Curtis.  Big props to my man for his preformance.  Hope to see you in more movies to come. p.s. I think Taylor Root is still a virgin 
 -Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or "ON WAR" has completely missed the point here.  -The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or "On War" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.  -The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?   -That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of "ON WAR".  -Its the ECONOMICS, stupid ! 
 Lots of data, but the story to tell seems to have never been found.  The findings are really not that interesting 
 My goodness, where do I begin...TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS AND A TON OF NONSENSE about life on "the Street". I spent 5 years on Wall Street in various areas of the industry at 2 of the top 5 firms and another one of the top 10 firms. I bought the book because I thought it might give me a basic overview of other areas I might be able to move into and plan a stategy to do. Geez, I was awestruck at the amount of poor writing and overinflated depictions of life in I-Banking. Spare me! I was shocked that the authors made it out of high school much less college and prestigious business program. (I should apply to the school and tell them you can't tell me "no" because you said "yes" to this guy, and look how he writes and openly acknowledges he's an alumni member.) Spend your money elsewhere. Find folks in the business. You will fare much better. This should get negative stars for a poor attempt at a marketing/advertising book attempting to be substantive 
 I have to admit I could only sit through this movie for about 45 minutes before I had to shut it off. It was that bad.  First of all the acting is horrible, even Jack Nickelson and Kathleen Turner. Jack's accent is afwul and both are really flat. Lowest point is where they confess there love to each other when a band is playing. The dialogue is so bad that George Lucas' Star Wars dialogues seem written by Shakespeare.  The music is great, nice classical stuff with a lot of strings. It would work wonderful in a costume drama but now it sounds like technomusic in a movie about a classical composer.  Looks like you really have to be Italian to get the accent right and not have it sound so rediculous like Nicholson and also Anjelica Huston.  Bad in everything, don't buy it  
 I've tried very hard with this album since its release, but have to disagree with most of the reviewers here. The incredible string band, pentangle, Bread, love and dreams comparisons are, in my opion, wishful thinking. This isn't due to Espers ability as song writers, but to their incessant use of annoying overdriven heavy metal type guitar everywhere. This ruins what is otherwise a nice album 
 these will not work in a dvd recorder to record tv.  it didn't say on the webpage, but on the back of the discs it states that the discs support recording only at 4x and 8x.  my dvd-recorder supports dvd+rw media but to record television 1x recording must be supported.  
 The characters in this book and production are its downfall.  The young lady owner sees someone take her diamond.  She has access to this person; it is someone she knows.  Why not just ask this person to give the diamond back?  Why not ask "Why did you take it?"  Why condemn this person without giving him or her a chance to speak?  This stupid girl (Rachel is her name) soured me on the whole book!  This is not the way that people would really act in this situation.  Collins asks readers to suspend disbelief too much.  If Rachel had spoken up, she could have saved others, like Sargent Cuff a lot of trouble 
 The basic problem is not just that Dr. Walford -- the 120 year diet guru -- died at 79.  The bigger problem is that he looked 90 when he died.  Now that is something hard to explain for the many fervent apologists from his sect.  And it is a sect.  Because otherwise you cannot explain their fervor, despite all the facts which would have stirred up some doubt in you or me.   Yes, Walford was a credible scientist who did some important research.  But in his ill-advised pose as anti-aging guru and in his books, he did himself a big disservice.  Because the truth is, caloric restriction works.  But Walford's regimen to practice caloric restriction did not an does not work.  It is unworkable.  It makes a difficult thing impossible.   And Walford looking 90 at his death was exhibit A of this irrefutable fact.  So buyer beware!  
 Very Very Disappointed, despite the comments from the Author, Preface & Publisher & the Delay in the Book Coming Out. Heaps of Information Esp in the Management arena & The References are grossly outdated (for instance it still quotes Braddom Textbook 1996 edition, PMR Secrets 1997 Edition, both having second editions (2000, 2002 respectively). Also eg: Facts on HRT are outdated. Way Too Expensive for Such a standard of text published. Should have costs less than 1/3 the retail price ! It deserves less than 1 star given the above negative points  
 There are several discrepancies in this book, starting with the title.  The top job is an air traffic controller, making approx. $120K a year.  Here's the problem:  To become an air traffic controller, a person must enroll in an FAA-approved education program and pass a pre-employment test that measures his or her ability to learn the controller's duties. Exceptions are air traffic controllers with prior experience and military veterans. The pre-employment test is currently offered only to students in the FAA Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative Program or the Minneapolis Community & Technical College, Air Traffic Control Training Program. The test is administered by computer and takes about 8 hours to complete. To take the test, an applicant must apply under an open advertisement for air traffic control positions and be chosen to take the examination. When there are many more applicants than available positions, applicants are selected to take the test through random selection. In addition to the pre-employment test, applicants must have 3 years of full-time work experience, have completed a full 4 years of college, or a combination of both. In combining education and experience, 1 year of undergraduate study--30 semester or 45 quarter hours--is equivalent to 9 months of work experience. Certain kinds of aviation experience also may be substituted for these requirements. That to me says I need a degree!  Several other jobs listed in the book are also "mis-informing".  
 I thought this book was going to include style tips and more how to's than it did. It had some how to's but not for interior design. (Incidentally, there are no photographs in this book, just some simple drawings. How can you write a book on interior design without including any pictures?) The book was also chock full of Emily Post style tips on writing letters, making time for yourself without feeling guilty, what kind of foods to prepare when, and tons of other little feel-good snippets. If you want great tips on interior design, find a better book than this one 
 This book contains very little about individuals.  For example, Belisarius is not even listed in the index, let alone having an entry.  Though that is not my kind of history, I bought the book anyway since late antiquity is one of my favorite periods of history.  I hoped the articles would be engagingly written and make up for lack of attention to the interesting personages of the time.  But all the articles I tried to read I found rather hard going... 
 While writing an easy-to-read book is certainly a gift of the author's, she is either grossly misinformed or ignorantly misinterpreting the life of Mary Baker Eddy and the healing practice of Christian Science. As a student of this Science, I found the references to it throughout the book untrue, definitely biased, and certainly unfair. Therefore, the main character's torment over whether or not she should stick with her beliefs about Christian Science and her final decision not to were not surprising nor unexpected, for with that degree of understanding (or rather, misunderstanding) of this religion's foundation and precepts, she surely made the right choice. For anyone interested in obtaining factual and accurate information about the life of Mary Baker Eddy, the discoverer and founder of Christian Science, I advise reading the following:  "Retrospection and Introspection" by Mary Baker Eddy "Mary Baker Eddy: Christian Healer" by Yvonne Cache von Feltweis and Robert Townsend Warneck "Mary Baker Eddy" by Robert Peel (3 Volumes: I. The Years of Discovery II. The Years of Trial  III. The Years of Authority "Mary Baker Eddy" Radcliffe Biography Series by Gillian Gil 
 This is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature. It is timely but it is not timeless.    Not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly. Not one scene is memorable. The true nature of the book -- soap opera-- is cloaked under its many pages.   Messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story, and she seems to have believed her publicity machine.  I can't believe that her husband, who a great literary critic, would not talk her out of publishing this.  Oh.  I forgot.  Money and fame trumps quality every time. 
 I was rather dissappointed at the content offered and barely impressed at the book's attempt at teaching new skills.  I bought the book for my 5, 7 and 9 year old children and the 9 year-old had already mastered all of the skills offered, the 7 year-old was bored very quickly and only the 5 year old's attention was held any length of time, but his age group lacks the concetration level to hang on for long.  The content was far too simple and barely progressed through the entire book...this book should be marketed to only highly introverted 4-6 year-olds in my opinion, and then it would get only 3 stars... 
 I've been a huge fan of Ms Cornwell for a long time, and I have a hard time believing that the author who wrote the first nine Scarpetta books is the same person who wrote Blowfly, Trace, Predator, and now, At Risk.  The last of Ms Cornwell's books that I actually purchased was Blowfly (big mistake!), and since then I will not spend a cent on one of her books until I've read a copy from the library.  When I first read the jacket on At Risk, I was very surprised and pleased to see that it wasn't another Scarpetta novel - all her characters in that series had become much too bizzare, pathetic, or just plain unlikeable - and had great hopes that she had written something new and fresh.  However, At Risk is no better (and probably worse in many ways) than her last three.  It actually doesn't start out too badly (not brilliant, but the characters and plot have some potential), but then, just as the plot and suspense are rising, you start the next chapter and find out that the detectives have it all solved!  The story has no rhythm, continuity, or logic to it.  The last half of the book reads like it was thrown together in about an hour.  Very disappointing.  I'm still hoping that Ms Cornwell will write another wonderful thriller (particularly if she continues to concentrate on fresh material and forget about the Scarpetta series) - after all, that talent must still be in there somewhere!  In the meantime, I won't waste my money and will be using my library card more 
 Could not find any application for my needs. May be usefull for professional photographers with press print application in mind, but for andvanced and amatuers photographers is useles 
 Robin Williams usually does a superb job - she's fun to read, has a perspective which is easy for the reader to understand and puts information clearly while not talking down to readers.   Not this time. If you want a book which tells you more than the very simplest of info about Tiger, don't buy this one. I'm an intermediate level user and I found that there are many glaring gaps in her lessons. I ran into many snags in getting used to switching over from System 9 and she didn't address any of the problems. Nor was her basic information about how Tiger operates useful in helping me trouble shoot the problems.  I wouldn't recommend the book to a new user either, because it was so superficial.  A minor irritant is that the editor (or somebody) did a very poor job of proofing it. There were a significant number of typos throughout the book 
 Questions are way off from the real thing, ineffective prep book, do not recommending buying it 
 Before you buy this book cut/paste the following words into a Google search:  "Hank Hanegraaff" financial  Then come back to this review.  It makes me weap to see Christian ministries misuse God's money. My advice?  If you really MUST read this book, buy it USED so the money goes to a struggling book seller.  
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 This is the worst movie I've ever seen... Damn!!! I don't even want to listen to the soundtrack, there is no reason in losing time........... 
 If you are looking for a book to read about poker, pass on this one unless you are desperate for any poker read.  Do so for a very simple reason:  there is surprisingly little about poker in this 'poker book'.    There is a detailed account of Ted Binion's murder which courses through the book.  In fact there is much more about Binion than about poker.  But this book was not found in the mystery section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Or you might like some insight about going to a jewelry store to pick out an anniversary ring for your wife.  This is covered in more detail than McManus' coverage of his WSOP satellite tournaments.  In fact, the author's wife Jennifer's ring size is six, a fact which for some reason I can't get out of my head.  But the book was not in the weddings/anniversaries section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Are you curious about McManus' childhood, his parents and grandparents?  Then this is the book for you, although it would usually be found in the autobiography section.  There is even a fascinating, endless chapter on whether A. Alvarez should have had intercourse with Sylvia Plath, and whether such coitus would have interrupted her eventual suicide (our  author thinks not, but we all know it depends).  But this book was not in the self-help-for-sick-poets section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  In all seriousness, I could go on and on with examples such as these.  It's not a bad book; in fact the sections on poker are really quite good.  If the author had edited out three quarters of the book, I would give it five stars.  When I go to the poker section of the bookstore and buy a book about poker, I want my goddess poker to be the topic.    If you're looking for one person's experience with poker, mostly but not exclusively in Vegas, read Anthony Holden's "Big Deal".  It's a great read, and it's even about poker.   
 I bought this epilator about 3 months ago and here are my thoughts on it. Pros - saves money on razors - good on large areas - entertaining if you're bored Cons - no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away (you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits) - ingrown hair can be a problem (especially in the bikini area) - hair doesn't grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth) - the epilator doesn't pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it. 
 Another raw feeding book is on the market and this one doesn't add anything new.  What bothered me the most was for all the hoopla, Lonsdale does NOT even talk about the QUALITY of the food you're feeding.  What good is feeding raw if you're not feeding QUALITY and natural proteins?  
 What a waste of time it was reading this book. If you are not very familiar with FW/IPS or VPN then this may be helpful, but if you have been working with this technology and Cisco's products that address these technologies (ASA, PIX, IPS, VPN3k) then please don't refer to this joke. Go online to cisco.com and do the research. Sometimes it felt as if whitepapers were copied and pasted.  Very dissapointed 
 Although I believe this book helps enlighten one to the reality that our soul and deepest longings as women are interconnected with the Creator and His passionate love for us...MUCH of it's "theology" is flawed.  I felt an appeal to self exaltation and a humanizing of God that is clearly anti-biblical.  I would guide any of my fellow Christian readers to remember that all false doctrine is effective because it is dressed up in truth....but it's heart message is false and usually self exhorting.  
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 I have been on an endless search for headphones that I can use while running that provide good sound quality and are comfortable.  I have had little luck, so at this point I am now just trying to find something that doesn't hurt!  I was very excited to get this particular headphone!  I thought for sure it would be my answer.  Boy, was I ever wrong!!  Just to give you an idea of what poor design they are... I am back to using the buds that came with my Ipod.   The sound quality on this set is poor unless you really push the headphone deep down into the ear.  The part that wraps around the ear is painful.    
 Well-researched biography, maybe; however, I found Robb's patronizing tone towards his subject to be distasteful, offensive. A more objective account--without a lurking sneer behind it--is in order. 
 The only reason I give this one star is because I don't think Amazon will let me do zero stars.  First, the book introduces 4 characters, then seems to focus on all but one. The next time we hear from the 4th character, she's all of a sudden found dead. None of it seems realistic at all. The author makes the counselor in the story the "savior," but this supposed counselor gives HORRIBLE advice. For example, when someone cries, one of the people in the group hands the crying person tissues, which (as I'm taught, since I grew up with a cemetery background) tells the crying person, "Shut up, we don't want to hear you." Also, she gives false statistics- one school counselor in this book tells a girl that 10% of the population is gay, which is completely false, taken from a very inaccurate survey. Finally, the book has no climax and no resolve. None of the characters are better, or worse, by the end of the book. Each has the same story: they have an eating disorder, go to this dumb group, cry and moan, and then continue with their eating disorder.     It's a horrible, horrible book. Don't bother wasting your time. I wish I didn't. Then again, I don't really like books directed at teens. They always end up childish and lacking in something, and this book lacks in A LOT. 
 Paul Tibbet should have been tried as a war criminal. I don't see anything to celebrate about on this 60th anniversary of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Perhaps the Japanese are rethinking about these events today and can write their own versions of what they think of these two genicides. Whether it saved lives or not is speculation, just that speculation.  We all know how speculation is viewed in a court of law 
 These are just OK, not great. I have 2 pairs of the clic readers and I love them. The sunglasses, however, are not as sturdy, the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and I just cannot endorse them. I am disappointed as I am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses. It's a shame 
 My children have loved playing in this tent. I like it also because it is not huge and doesn't take up a lot of room, but it is also not made out of very durable material.  I picked it up to move it out of the way and it ripped.  It is easy to pop-up and down, just will probably not have a very long lifetime with kid's play 
 Okay, I love shock comedy. I have Orgasmo, Team America, and South Park in my DVD library. I usually buy the shows from Adult Swim as well. I'm sweet for the most vile and disgusting humor imaginable (including a horrid flick entitled "Porn of the Dead" given to me as a joke last year), but this movie was simply pathetic. The jokes were predictable and unfunny, the plot was threadbare and weak, and the only reason I think anybody likes this movie is simply because it's got an imitation Kermit the Frog on smack and a cat bl*wing a walrus. Why is this tripe a cult classic? Is this what constitutes groundbreaking originality? Ha-Freakin-Ha. That was sarcasm.  The "hero" of this 97 minute long fecal log is an obnoxious, whining, self-pitying pink hippo who can't stop stuffing bakery cakes down her gullet long enough to figure out why nobody likes her anymore. Sure, her walrus boyfriend is cheating on her, but besides the degradation of both her stage career and her body (of which both things are certainly her own fault), there is nothing else wrong in her life. Somehow, this justifies the machine-gun slaughter of all the folks she knows. This mass murdering Hippo (whose character is a blatant ripoff of Hoppopotomus on that 80's cartoon "The Wuzzles") serves only ten years in prison at the end, as if her inverted sadness excuses her heinous crimes. Sure, the "bad guy" of a Walrus and his hustling rat pal are dead, but so are a whole bunch of one-note characters that we barely heard from during the movie at all, and simply didn't deserve to die at the Hippo's hands. Usually, I giggle at mass-murder vengeance in movies (if the killer is righteous, ala Frank Castle), but this stupid, selfish, gluttonous hippo just makes the almost-cool end of this insufferable film all the more detestable.  From the very boring musical number at the beginning to the brainlessly unsatisfying end, there is nothing worth writing about that happened in between. (Well, maybe the sodomy song, but other than that....)  Peter Jackson: King Kong, Frighteners, LOTR....all GREAT movies. The only redeeming quality to this stupid Feeble flick is the credits, 'cause that means the torture is finally over. Which "walrus" did you play the "cat" with to find work again after this?  Avoid this unimaginative sewage at all costs 
 I happen to know this author from his early escapades, and he was well known among his friends and acquaintances as a greasy con man -- hence his bankruptcy early on.  For kicks, I got his book and confirmed that it is as worthless as the man himself.  He's a total fraud, and if you want to do worse than waste your money you'll buy his book instead of applying yourself with truly worthwhile business ventures.  Buyers beware -- avoid at all costs!!!  Robert Lon 
 This book is full of poorly written essays backed only by the authors' direct ties to the beat generation.    Instead, buy this book ("Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript, and Variant Versions, Fully Annotated by Author..."), which is cheaper and very very interesting to those fascinated by Howl and Ginsberg, or even just the poetic process.  "Howl Fifty years later" was a great disapointment for me. 
 Having read books 1-6, I can confirm that these History books are quite terrible. Often events are told out of order, especially in the stories of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. The faulty chronology is very confusing when reading the books. Furthermore, the series are intended for elementary or middle school students, and making it available for such a wide spectrum makes it seem very condescending for those at the higher age range. For example, when describing latitude and longitude, she says to think of the world as a big fat man with a belt around his waist (i.e. the equator). Hakim weaves multi-culti fables, saying that the Americans got their ideas about what to put in the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation from the Iroquios League. That is absurd. Our system of government is based off of Athens, the Roman Republic, English law (minus that whole monarchy business), the republic of Venice, and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. She states that "some historians" think there may have been as many as 75 million indians (beg pardon, "The First Americans") pre-Columbus, but fails to give a bottom estimate, giving the impression that Europeans wiped out all the Amerindians. All in all, the books are inaccurate, misleading, and demeaning 
 As a practicing psychotherapist I was appalled by this book. The characters were one dimensional, the "therapy" demonstrated was simplistic, narcissitic and arrogant, and the writing just wasn't that good 
 I read another book by this author, Friendship Cake, which I really enjoyed and passed around to several friends. So I picked this one up thinking it would be worth a read. Luckily, it only took me about an hour and a half to read it, since that's about as long as I'll remember it.  I guess I never really cared about the characters too much. It's not a thick enough book that there's a lot of room for exploring and exposing the characters, which is too bad, because they could be interesting. And I know Hinton's capable of it from her last book. I also read that the author thinks race relations is so important to this story ... I never got the whole emphasis on race relations thing. The story happens to characters who happen to be interracial friends/lovers, but I never get that it's important to the plot.  Not to mention that the "big secret" is telegraphed so blatantly it's hard not to know what it is almost immediately.   In spite of its faults, I think it would be OK for a quick beach read or if you just don't care for much depth at the moment 
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 This book comes after "Devil's Embrace" and is about their son and daughter. The in print version has been RE-WRITTEN 
 I bought this book because I am switching from Windows to Linux on my home network.  I thought it might be quicker to learn the ins and outs with the book vs. surfing from place-to-place on the web.  My experience with the book is not that great--it never provides enough information on any subject to answer the question I have.  I always have to resort to the internet for enough information to solve the problem of the day.  It might be o-k for general Linux information, but it won't get you up and running as a system administrator on a home network 
 I enjoyed the book up until page 111. There the author compared a person being late for an appoinment in Brazil as being somehow comparable to the murder of women in Arab cultures by members of their own family. How those  two situations are even faintly comparable is beyond me. If that woman who  is being murdered in the name of "protecting an important social  institution" were known by the author he might be able to disengage  from intellectual abstraction and acknowledge the inhumanity and horror the  murder of these women in the name of "honor" actually represents 
 I found much of the humour in this movie to be downright silly and stupid.  In no way does this movie compare to others in the genre from the same period, such as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" or "Sixteen Candles".  Just no comparison.  So I'm totally dumbfounded that many of the reviews here speak so highly of it.  If what I read is true, Cusack is very much justified in regretting participating in this movie.  It's a blemish on what has been a pretty good movie career so far 
 James Glassman should apologize for his stupidity, his arrogance, and this book, which lured in a whole lot of amateur investors just as the stock market was about to go bust.  
 What a terrible book.  While I am certain that the author thought he was being clever, it is a perfect example of the type of rabbinical tyranny that created Zionism as a secular movement.  Who is this jerk to demand of any other Jew how he or she should live?  Feh!  
 I bought this book thinking it would be a good read before my husband and I started trying for a baby. The cover captions looked like there would be some great information inside. However, when I got the book and read the table of contents I immediately realized it was a book about infertility. I only give it 1 star not based on the content but on the misleading cover of the book. I'll have to pay better attention next time 
 Who can claim this is the ultimate book?  Who is the editors of homeowner?  I don't trust this book since I don't see an author's name attached.  Authors are more credible even though editors make more 
 I agree with the other reviewers - I was really disappointed. This too slim volume - especially for the price - is designed for a 5 year old - and a simple one at that. Not a good buy - WAY too little info and annoying hand drawn illustrations- all in all a terrible buy 
 I feel ripped off in that the description of the book said the complete works of Van Gogh, and I thought it was 1 big book. Instead I got a much smaller hardbound, only part 2 
 I want to be sure not to come off as too negative, I liked this book.  It's wholesome but not naïve, there's something in it for everyone.  The restoration of an old truck as muse for observations on love, life, the changes in the world since it rolled off the assembly lines, and gardening is a neat idea, so much so that I enjoyed it the first time I read this book, which was in 1977 when the author wrote it.  His name is John Jerome.  Now don't get me wrong, this isn't simply the same book over again, I mean sure the original was about all the same things and it dealt a lot more with the philosophy of the human experience than it did nuts and bolts, and sure it was titled `Truck' and it was about the same length and the guy seemed to view the world through about the same lens and etc. And both Jerome and Perry were free lance magazine writers when they decided to restore old pickups, and both framed a lot of the story around their mechanical clumsiness.  But in the original, the truck was a '50, not a '51 and John Jerome was living with a woman at the start of his book whereas Perry is dating, so it's really totally different.  And Jerome lives in a very small town in New Hampshire, not a very small town in Wisconsin.  Look I'll prove it to you.  Here's the opening sentence of Jerome's book `PROBLEM:  Hauling horseshit for the garden one barrelful at a time is a depressingly inefficient system' whereas Truck (oops, I mean the new book) starts with the polar opposite `The story begins on a pile of sheep manure the size of a yurt'  See?  horse poo and sheep poo are not at all the same.  I once heard that a guy in Nabokov's village had written a book much like `Lolita' 20 years earlier and Nabokov is known to have read it.  They don't think he stole it, they think he mistook his memory for an inspiration.  There's even a word for it, cryptomnesia.  I'm not sure if Michael Perry did the same thing, maybe there's a forgotten copy of `Truck' by John Jerome in his old bedroom at his parents' place, or maybe this is the official world's biggest coincidence, I'll tell you one thing I don't believe for a second Perry tried to steal the original book, he seems too good a guy and at least too smart to use the same title.  Angel though he might be however, this is someone else's book.  
 I usually consider myself pretty accepting of different vocal styles, and since I'm a massive fan of death metal I have grown accustomed to moronic and uninspired lyrics...but this is too much even for me.  I bought this album after hearing the song "Cleansation," which I thought was very good.  The rest of the songs fell flat.  I tried listening to this album multiple times since I had heard SO much praise of it, but it was a chore to sit through.  When I hear the vocalist screaming "I...HATE.....EVERYONE!" repeatedly, it just doesn't get much dumber.  It's clearly a ploy to try to win over some of those pre-teen boys rebelling against their parents, by tapping into that pseudo-angst that you hear so much in bands like Slipknot.  Frankly I cannot stomach music that is clearly marketed towards 13 year olds, as it is an insult to the intelligence of anyone past that age...or to 13 year olds who are able to sense maturity in music and lyrics.  Beyond that, the vocals themselves would be much more suited for a nu-metal band.  The music itself here is decent, especially considering the atrocious roadrunner roster that we have to compare it to.  However, overall the songwriting is not memorable, and the vocals just ruin the entire sound.  This is basically a watered down version of extreme metal.  While it may be very useful for getting some slipknot fans listening to some better stuff (what i think of as extreme metal "training wheels"), if you are already into the scene you are better off looking right past this release.    Sorry to slam this, but I was told REPEATEDLY that this was the album of 2004...and I've never been more disgusted.  
 This movie is pathetic.   A frequently naked kari wuhrer is the only redeemable feature about this film.   Without her showing any skin this movie wouldn't even merit one star.   If this is what you're looking for there is an abundance of it and it's very worthwhile.   Run your dvd player or vcr from nude scene to nude scene because if you try to watch the film you may never want to see this beautiful woman again.   The entire film takes place inside of a couples apartment, cast of only three.   The male artist is perhaps the most pitiful excuse for a human that has ever existed.   He is spoiled, whiney, childish, cowardly, selfish, insensitive, and stupid; i may be giving him too much credit.   Mass murderers, child molesters, and war criminals deserve more respect than this jellyfish.   Why an intelligent woman who has alot going for her would stay with a loser like this is the question you'll be asking yourself the whole film.    Movies like this are career enders.   Kari wuhrer does as much as possible in this film to make it worthwhile; she takes her clothes off frequently and for long durations; but, this stinker is beyond redemption.   Kari needs to make a few gonzo pornos to upgrade her resume.   I wish everybody well who made this film because i'm sure all of you wish this thing would disapear and go away.   I tip my hat to the distributor for recognizing  a fine naked body when they see one and not passing up the chance to make money off it 
 This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye.  The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either.  I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it 
 Although it's stupid to compare these episodes of the twilight zone to the originals that inspired it, it's hard not to feel a little let down by the pay-off at the end of most of the stories on offer here, season one of this run had some what could be loosely described as 'Classic Episodes' and very much justified there existence plus season one had the ambition that season 2 and 3 are sadly lacking. Shorter and more rushed you could see that the poor writers and directors were working on a shoe string and ideas are never fully realised which is a shame because some of the ideas here could have been played out so much better none more so than in the very first episode on disc one ' The once and future King ' Where an elvis impersonator is transported back to before elvis cut his first demo. The premise is set up brilliantly but is let down at the pay off. other episodes of note 'shelter skelter', 'the Hellgramite method', 'curious case of edgar wetherspoon' show traces of genius and are well worth writing home about however the real 'classic' on offer here is ' the Cold Equations ' where real character and depth go hand in hand with just plain twisted sadness, it is brilliant if just a tad depressing. However the bad out weighs the good. The sign of a great tv series is if it bears repeated viewing and remains as sharp the second time around and with Mr Serlings originals you could more or less say that about 90% of them. These however, with the exception of the said episodes above, do not stand up so well. But still you need to buy it to finish the collection. 
 Some of the medical information is very helpful.  My recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35, it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy, nor is it for someone who has young children at home.  Her hormonal theory, that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families, and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed.  Many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age.  Do I think that my total hysterectomy at 34 (and the obvious onset of menopause) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children?  Of course not.  That's ridiculous, and if I think about it too much, it's actually offensive.  Her comments about marriage are questionable, as well.  Marriages sustain many changes, and menopause is just one of them.  Open lines of communication, deep love and commitment are certainly enough to weather the "hormonal storm."  How sad that it seems as if one point of the book is that menopause is the time to assess your marriage.  Shouldn't we be doing that every day, and re-committing ourselves to growing together?    Many reviewers have commented on some of her more non-traditional methods.  I am not a fan of tarot cards, and I'm not sure how I feel about taking medical advice from someone who diagnosed herself on several occassions, by using them.  That's just my own opinion.  I tried to look beyond that.  I just think this is another book written for people older than I am.  That's okay, but it still leaves me looking for something I can truly relate to 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 Wells is a wonderful writer, it is true; however, his bigotry and hatred of certain peoples and of religion is very apparent. His political leanings are also too apparent--it is not an unbiased book and may give some the wrong impression of world events. I am currently reading the book updated just after WWII 
 I thoroughly enjoyed previous entries in the "Cat Who..." series, but this one was very disappointing.  In fact, I was so disappointed in this one that I pulled out a couple of older ones to see if my tastes had simply changed!  No, the book just doesn't measure up.  As another viewer commented - too cutesy, too predictable, too little mystery.  I will look for subsequent titles at the library rather than purchase them in hardback.  I hope this is just an oddball flop 
 Sal Mineo and those interested in his life and career deserve better than this tawdry clip job. There is no evidence that the author conducted any interviews with friends, family or colleagues of Mineo. He plays up Mineo's gay sexuality till it becomes tiresome. The A&E Biography is much better, as is E!'s episode of Mysteries and Scandals devoted to Mineo 
 	Junie B. Jones goes to first grade at last!  If you liked Junie B. Jones in Kindergarten, you'll love her in first grade. I know I did! I like Junie B. because she's a trouble maker. She always has an excuse for everything. She goes on little adventures which hardly work out well. If you like trouble, go to your local library and get Junie B. Jones Goes to First Grade at Last 
 The book is long and boring. It deals more with JFK style theories of what could have been, rather than what it really was. In the end, it falls short of its goal of debunking the resurrection accounts.   I wish the editors would challenge William Lane Craig and Gary Habermas to an extended (3-day or more) debate on this subject. Until then, these theories are only that, plausible? yes, most of them. True?  Not likely, given the evidence to the contrary 
 It's obvious that my review differs from the majority, but I emphatically stand by my opinion: this movie was really, really, really lousy.   Keifer Sutherland (whom I generally like a lot...he is why I watched this turkey in the first place) portrays a stone alcoholic, chain-smoking, gravel-voiced, burned out bum of a cop who guzzles gallons of booze and staggers from scene to scene like one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. This is his worst performance (that I have ever witnessed) and to make matters even more grim, the entire plot is a confusing, poorly-directed mess. I think that the majority of Keifer's boozing is due to his embarrassment over appearing in this truly wretched movie.  If you insist on viewing this bomb, you will hear the word "Jabberwocky" at least 10,000 times (and come to hate it with a white-hot intensity)....you will see Keifer Sutherland's character drink countless gallons of whiskey (often straight from the quart bottle at his desk in the police station) and smoke at least 9,500 cigarettes (this movie could be used as aversion therapy by A.A. or the American Lung Association)....you will see ghosts, apparitions, and silly psychic flashbacks that are about as convincing and relevant as those in "Sabrina the Teenage Witch". At one point, a character wants to convey the name of the villain to Kiefer in a "psychic vision", so rather than just say the name (which would be way too easy), he lures the villain to appear in a mirror ("through the looking glass")....silly.  The basic premise of this movie resembles the TV series "Medium", in which a psychic can sense details about a crime by touching objects associated with the crime....but the TV show is vastly superior in every respect: acting, plot, direction, and characterization. Also, the only psychic visions that a drunk of this magnitude is likely to see involve elephants....pink ones. This movie would not qualify as a tolerable made-for-TV drama...and that is very, very sad.  There are numerous allusions to "Alice in Wonderland" (the original name of this bomb was "After Alice"): Kiefer starts having his "psychic visions" after falling through a hole, a character is named "Hatter", etc. etc. I assure you that none of this cuteness will add to your viewing pleasure in any way.   So, you can listen to the other reviewers and waste your time and money, or listen to the warning I am offering loud and clear: there is a reason that this movie was never released in theaters...and God knows, it shouldn't be released in your home either. Avoid it....you really don't need to hear the word "Jabberwocky" 10,000 times....do you ??? 
 The only part I like about this book is the description of Flash coordinate system. From chapter to chapter, there is nothing in it but a red little ball moving around. I am not sure what is the point 
 Outside of "Memnoch the Devil," this is the worst vampire novel written by Rice.  It's basically homo erotica in the guise of a vampire story.  It single handedly ruined the image of Armand I had (not that Rice had to write to my expectations!). Not only is it filled with homo erotica, it's filled with pedophilia.  This ruined Marius for me, too.  He's basically a child predator.  He educates young boys in his home, where he and Armand begin to have a love affair.  It's really full of deviant sexual imagery, and as I've mentioned before, what is Rice's obsession with male sexuality?  There are never any depictions of lesbianism (that I remember), just extreme examples of gay, male sex, including Marius (a man) and Armand (a boy).  It's revolting to read.  Would women like to read about an older women preying on young girls?  Her writing about men is twisted and severely distorted.  If you take out all of this deviance, the book has some beautiful descriptions of the settings in which the story takes place.  This and the origins of Armand, are the sole redeeming values of this novel - and it's not quite so full of religious tripe as latter novels.  My advice is skip this and read other novels by her, except "Memnoch the Devil," which is even worse than this novel 
 Obviously bogus reviews.  Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting.  Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting.  What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5?  how bout tossing us all a bone 
 This book is good if you want to be warned over and over to wash your hands! If you are looking for the difference between viruses and bacteria, actual scientific references or interesting facts about how germs and bacteria live, reproduce and colonize us - look elsewhere. This book was too preachy and didn't have enough information for anyone with a genuine interest in biology, human physiology, or health. 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  This so-called "producer's journey" included many anecdotes about shows with which the author was not even involved!  Misspellings of peoples names and incorrect facts  abound.  He barely covered 1776, a seminal show that he should have many  stories about.  Read Ethan Mordden if you want provocative insight on  Broadway musicals 
 Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book 
 We were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new.   They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense.  I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash 
 I moved out to LA from NY and there is considerable less amount of humidity in LA.  My skin was drying up. So I asked and was recommended this humidifier. Unfortunately it did nothing to alleviate my dry skin. I blasted it on high and still nothing.  The filter seems to run out pretty quickly. The product seems very fragile. The material is cheap and the water tank doesn't fit properly into the product, so that moving it even it a little causes water to leak.  The plus side was that it was easy to assemble and it was cheap 
 Hugh Grant is not too offensive in this role. He is not too cutesy here, and that is something for which to be thankful. In the film Grant's character Michael is engaged to marry Gina, the daughter of an Italian-American mobster (played by James Caan). Michael is a successful auctioneer, and after his engagement to Gina, Gina's father starts using Michael and his connections to the art world to launder money. Soon the FBI is onto the scheme (with Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson as a particularly funny FBI officer). Michael attempts to hide these dealings from Gina (Michael of course did not want to get involved with all of this illicit activity in the first place but was railroaded-it is the mafia after all). When Gina finds out their relationship crumbles. An accident causes even more problems, potentially fatal ones. Overall this is not a great movie and not even particularly funny. However, you will be able to sit through it and maybe get some entertainment value from it 
 This movie was good for the most part but then again if you dont want to see drunk indians shoot white people then dont worry about seeing it. There were some good parts in this movie but the whole movie was a rather large dissapointment. These Indains would kill people so they could get their Jollies off by getting alcohol for it, even though the story wasnt to be based on this. This movie was very unrealistic as far as that actually happening, like if someone to be arrested they wouldnt be let go OR given a gun, and all the actors should be reformed and be made better through my eyes. I take my reviews very serioulsly and this movie was not that good at all, do not let your children be scared by watching this movie. John Wayne was a good actor props to my man Wayne, he's my man. However his career could have been a lot better off had he not made this movie 
 I am not a John Wayne fan, and believe other reviewers who have pointed out the inaccuracies in 'Flying Tigers', but I'd like to have the DVD just to take me back to a time (1942) when, at the age of six, I was left with a friend in the United Artists theater on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, to watch my very first movies - this one, and 'Bambi'.  I entered that movie house a dedicated, blood-thirsty fan of blowing enemy folks to bits, and left horrified by having repeatedly watched pilots get their faces shot off behind broken canopy glass.  I had not realized there was so much bleeding in war, and that death might actually happen. Upon returning home, I told my mother, who would die, of TB, the following year, that I had become a pacifist.  'Uh huh'. she replied, knowing well my sanguinary inclinations. Of course, she was right - before very long, I was happily imagining myself flying a B-17 and creating firestorms all over Europe.  This is a VERY good movie for young children to see 
 Sandra Harding is so repetative and redundant, it was extremely difficult to concretly understand her point.  Her argument that feminist theories challenge androcentric approach of western philosophy and scientific  thought was lost in her writing style and syntax 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 Worked okay until I installed XP Service Pack 2.  Now I can no longer scan using my Brother MFC-9700 and Paperport 9.  It has been a long time since Service Pack 2 was released, and Scansoft has left everyone who bought Paperport 9 in the cold.  I could not care less if they now come up with software that is compatible with SP2.  This kind of treatment of customers makes it clear that they do not deserve our business.  Don't take my word for it.  Google the issue, and you'll find out that there are a lot of dissatisfied customers.  From now on, I'll avoid Scansoft 
 This was the main thing my daughter wanted for xmas.  Three months later I finally gathered everything up in a grocery bag and took it back to the store because it had just sat collecting dust.  Main reason being we couldn't get it open.  It took 2 days to set the date.  Then I figured since I could do that it would be ok to close it until we could work with it some more.  We tried and tried to use the password but no luck.  Honestly I think they need to take the thing off the market.  It's a nice concept.  I ended up getting her the barbie dairy instead.  Much less stress and much cheaper.  I know there are plenty of people out there that agree with me I only wish I would have listened to you before I bought it. 
 I bought this product for my husband for christmas because he talks on the phone a lot with work. The instructions say 8 hours of talk time. However, it only has 3 hours of talk time before it needs to be recharged. So, its a good product if you don't need more than 3 hours of talk time. But, bad if you need it all day. 
 In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.

 Listen, I have bought several of these book lights, every time they break. It is not the bulb, or the plug or the batteries, it is the wiring. Don't bother. I am currently on search and destroy for a new book light that will last longer then 5 days and wont hurt my eyes. Any suggestions 
 This book TEACHES you to hate yourself and develop an eating disorder by putting yourself in the mindset. It might not show it at first, but that's what it eventually does. 
 For what it claims to be, should have been better written and better designed 
 I bought this DVD to get some idea of the Nordic skiing technique.  The DVD is divided in two: the first bit, a very basic lesson of nordic skking, taught old techniques no longer in use.  The second bit was a pure publicity to the Canadian system, not really explaining anything... I bought other DVD's at the time that were much much useful than this 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 "Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.    The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.  The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.    With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more. 
 Ok I know this DVD is not out when I write this review. But I've seen the movie back in Asia when it was released in theater about 1.5 years ago. The movie is based on a novel called "Seven swords" (duh). I have personally read the entire story (book) and I have to say it was quite good. But the movie version was a big let down. First of all, a long and complicated story is squeezed into a 2 hour long movie. Many aspects related to the characters which are also crucial for understanding the story are missed out. My friend who had never read the book was somewhat confused and found the movie a drag as it went on. The next big problem is the actors and actresses. Frankly, the acting is plain terrible. Especially Leon Lai, an untalented singer who can neither act nor sing but makes millions of dollars off fanatic fans, was absolutely unbearable. Last but not least, the special effects. I'm not sure if the movie maker didn't know how to make it good, or they were just trying to do things the easy way and didn't care about the outcome. It almost seems like every single action is incomplete and cut short. The result is not only unexciting, but irritating. Well, at least that's what I thought when I saw it. So my advice is, go rent the movie if you really wanna see it. It could possibly end up as a disappointment 
 This was a difficult book to read. The author had a tendancy to switch between scenes. No space, no line, no star. While this may work for Thomas Pynchon, it just made this book unpleasant to read. Besides this, the characters were a bit flat. I didn't like Druss much at all. I pictured him the entire time as a dwarf. The first half of the book I did not enjoy the plot much at all. Near the second half of the book the author hit his stride and reading was easy and fun. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one.  The end was predictable. Well, predictable except for the way the author pulled solutions for everyone's problems out of his posterior. The stuff at the end just felt like the author lost momentum and made up a way to tie off all the plot lines. Very unsatisfying. I know I won't continue this series 
 This is not the Richard Ford of The Sportswriter, much less Independence Day; the intervening two decades must have taken a terrible toll on this author.  I found two chapters with dialogue sufficient to engage my interest.  The balance of this novel is filled with so much meaningless, monotonously descriptive narrative that I began to suspect I was reading a New Jersey travel brochure.  I want a refund.  I deserve a refund.    
 Question for MJS:  If the book was so bad, why did you give it FOUR stars?? 
 When I received this DVD, I played it on my iMac. When doing this, I discovered that there were Chinese characters showing at the top of the screen. The quality of the DVD images were dark and grainy. I reported to Amazon that they had unknowlngly sold me a pirated DVD, and I was saddened to not have a response from Amazon other than refunding my costs. Copyright is not only a law to protect publishers; it also protects consumers from getting poor quality products. I feel that I can no longer depend on Amazon to provide my DVD orders. 
 I get what the author was trying to do with this book.  However, given that she used an old fashioned, tongue and cheek, call and response type of language, it's better suited for adults rather than children IMHO.  When I first read the book I knew that it was meant to be taken lightly.  For instance, there is a part of the story in which the grandfather essentially questions why God would have given such a sweet child such 'nappy' hair.  While an adult might chuckle over this, a child might actually cringe because they are still dealing with this question in their own minds ('Why me?').    All in all, this book was the first of several children's books attempting to affirm the positives in African hair.  In this sense, it should be respected as such.  However, first is not always best.  Subsequent books have done increasingly better in providing needed self esteem in this area for our youth.  If adults want to buy this, they should be prepared to keep it to themselves rather than force it upon their children.  Young kids might not be ready to grasp it's implications.  
 Just not my cup of tea.  Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series 
 It's conceivable that some scholarly professor living in some dimly-lit library on some hermetically-sealed university campus will be able to decipher this jargon-filled tome. For the rest of us, this book is a virtually unreadable barrage of dry, dismal, academic slang without even a single moment of levity. It's two-hundred-plus pages of "crucial cultural intertexts" and "structural homology" and "strucural displacement" -- and those three phrases came from ONE SENTENCE on page four!   How is it possible to write a book about Bollywood that is so utterly devoid of color and joy? The author has accomplished exactly that. It could be that this book might contain a few tangible ideas or meaningful illuminations, but they're buried so deeply under the weight of such pompous verbage that they'll never see the light of day. Bollywood has never been so tediously presented 
 I bought this product.  The second time I used it the volume control broke.  I can't adjust the volume.  So I returned it for another one of the same model with the manufacturer.  Three days later, the same problem, the volume control broke.  Horrible quality product.  The manufacturer should pull the product and address the problem.  
 Although this book had some interesting things to say, it was, in general, too "compact" for its own good. Bruegmann's arguments against traditional anti-sprawl histories read more like a jedi mind trick than a careful argument. A more careful argument with more supporting facts would have added to the book. As it is, it seems to me that this book will do little to change anyone's view of the 21st century city 
 This is a horrible failure of a book. It depends totally on its ending, and at the end, delivers nothing. It is the sort of book you throw at the wall.   It starts well. Fraught with potential, it captures your imagination,leads you along an interwoven tale full of incidents and detail. Little of substance happens, no characters develop, and no real story is built. But it carries you because it promises, again and again, that all that transpires is a part of the mystery that will be resolved at the end.   Surprise ! There is no resolution at the end. A character annouces that everything was made up (for reasons that make no sense). The tale descends into farce. There is a deluge, flooding, drowning. I could only think of the Poseidon Adventure. Everything is washed away except the bad taste left in your mouth.  The book does not offer enough to survive such a nonsensical ending. There are a score of books in this genre (Eco, Peares). Your time would be much better spent with one of those.  
 What an abyss exists between the potency of the Book of the Law and Crowley's cheap shot commentaries, welcome to the Tawdry New Age. But this is perhaps the best pointer to the profundity of the original, even Crowley  seems to have finally understood the stink of all this, and thus the short  comment, but it takes years to really understand, pearls before swine, and  this case of poo before swin 
 Jane Monheit has a lovely voice, reminds me of early Maureen McGovern.  That's the good news.  The bad news is everything else. The songs she chose for this live CD are uninteresting and over-performed by practically everyone else.  Worse, Monheit and her back-up arrangements have no tempo, no intention, and no gut feelings invested in them. It's the aural equivalent of watching paint dry. "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" is so stretched out, you could do a load of laundry and your grocery shopping, come back, and she'd still be singing it. Monheit also feels the need to talk between every single number, before she launches into her boring rendition of it.  I asked for this CD for Christmas, based on the 4 1/2 star rating it recieved on Amazon.    Don't believe everthing you read!! 
 I bought this can opener because I wanted one in black and a stand-up electric that take up less counter space and is for tall cans. We've had a few problems with misfires. The unit would not grip the can and we had to re-align it. It also needs a little more power. The magnet that is supposed to grip the lid is not strong enough. The unit gets two stars, one for the color and one for the shape 
 I have been looking for a good cheese plane, and this one isn't it.  It works fine for rubbery semi-soft cheeses like swiss, but not for harder cheese like cheddar, which tend to crrumble before I can finish a slice.  The problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid.  It should be thin and flexible.  Also, don't let the name fool you.  This utensil is made in China, a country which consumes very little cheese 
 The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through.  The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense.  The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book.  The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's "Wednesday's Child".  I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home!  
 they are a lovely color, but I don't like the fact they aren't zippered.  They slip off constantly 
 Although I wasn't too pleased to see this book published, I read it while trying my best to be as unbiased as possible.  After pondering it and weighing it against Miss Ann's offering, all I can say is this:  Someone who makes a parody of a parody is not going to great lengths to convince me they attended Harvard.    I think it's ironic that the author entitled the book "Soulless" as Estrich has some of the most skewed views on God and religion in general.  
 This book confirms an observation of mine; that contemporary art is the expression of a politically liberal world view, deeply pessimistic about humanity, and driven by an unwitting self-loathing. I'm sorry she and her friends see things this way. Much of our world is created by the way we view it. This Gablik creation is dark indeed. I would have much greater sympathy if it wasn't so self-inflicted. The world is what you make it 
 Recently I got into a conversation with the guy next to me on the plane about some of the memorable books we had each read in the past few years.  Unfortunately, I had to recall `Confidence'-easily the worst book I've read in years.  To describe it as disappointing is to go easy on Ms. Kanter.  It is far beyond that, and altogether abominable and embarrassing.  That such a prestigious business school like Harvard can tenure a professor who writes such insipid pablum boggles the mind.  Let's start with the central (and only) idea of the book--that winning begets winning and losing begets losing.  This of course strikes most people as fairly straightforward and unworthy of a book's worth of elaboration.  Yet Ms. Kanter tumbles all over herself to spell out the details: why this is the case (as if someone with an ounce of inferential ability couldn't figure it out in a couple of minutes), how it affects team morale, how it self-perpetuates, etc...  And worst of all, endless, endless, endless examples that do nothing or very little to elucidate; rather, they simply restate what has just been said.  And they restate and restate and restate.  Tautological (I think the word was invented in anticipation of this book), boring, tedious, insipid, stupid, unthoughtful, unenergetic, disengaged, disrespectful.  All these adjectives apply forcefully to the book.  Most of all, though, it is utterly uninventive and cliched.  Turn to any page and you'll find such gems of penetrating insight as (forgive me, but these are so funny I have to quote at length):   "Winning feels good, and good moods are contagious.  Success makes it easier to view events in a positive light, to generate optimism.  It produces energy and promotes morale.  It is easier to aim high and expect to reach the target."  (P. 29)  "Overcoming obstacles, leaping over hurdles, and recovering from fumbles can strengthen a team that has the discipline not to panic under pressure." (P. 71)  "Once the 'loser' label gets slapped on, those suffering losses are set up to fail.  They find it harder to get support, harder to get opportunities." (P. 115)  "Various turnaround tasks operate on different clocks.  Bold strokes are fast and can be done by one powerful person; long marches to change culture and behavior take more time and the commitment of many people.  Execution is play by play, game by game, while strategy is season by season..." (P. 178)  "People embodying the pathologies of the past can always be replaced, but eliminating the bad does not automatically produce the good.  It takes a major effort on the part of leaders to foster confidence that a demoralized company or group is capable of working together and succeeding at it.  Restoring people's (sic) confidence in one another requires four kinds of action..." (P. 241)  "Confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome, but what happens when outcomes are negative?  The dividing line between winning streaks and losing streaks is the choice of behavior in response to setbacks...  That decision to build rather than retreat, to rally rather than get discouraged, involves viewing setbacks through an optimistic lens, as an opportunity to learn and move on." (P. 357)  And it just goes on and on, mercilessly and cluelessly.   The wisest, most incisive business people read, study and think about far more than just sports and business.  I would recommend Ms. Kanter first enroll in a decent freshman-level literature or history seminar.  There she can learn to write and, with some effort on her part and perhaps a bit of luck, to formulate some imaginative approaches to problem-solving.  Beyond this bilge, I have had the good fortune to come across many books that have helped address confidence.  These are: selected essays by Montaigne and Emerson, `Hamlet', Whitman's "Song Of Myself", David Herbert Donald's biography `Lincoln', `Emotional Intelligence', `Flow', and Jack Welch's `Winning'.  `Confidence' inspires confidence only in the realization that you (no matter who you are) are at least intelligent enough to be the "Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor" at Harvard Business School 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 I once saw this movie seven years ago and really liked it.  Hey, I was young and naive.  I recently rented this movie to see it again.  I was once again robbed of my money. Cameron's Closet is 90 minutes of pure boredom.  The acting is horrible, the monster is laughable, the writing is unbelieveable, I could just go on and on about how terrible this movie is. Cameron is a young boy who has telekinetic powers.  He then brings a demon to life through a statue his dad gave him.  Then people begin to die.  A detective and a psychiatrist begin to investigate. I can't begin to comprend why I liked this movie the first time I saw it.  This is just one big laughfest from the start to the end 
 Horrible book.  The racist continues his trend of substandard writing 
 I am a pharmacy student, and this is a very thorough text book, but as a study guide I have found that it is mainly boring and useless. Anyone other than a medical student probably should find a better text book 
 First of all, despite the claim that it works with MacIntosh, it definately does not.  There is a template that you can use in Mac with Word, Claris, and other photoshop software, but there are no instructions as to how.  Once you think you have it figured out (on the page) it doesn't print the same as pictured.  The technial support people have no idea how to make it work with Mac, and will probably tell you it is a problem with your printer drivers.  In any case, they have no idea how to direct you through the process of using the Word template for MacIntosh.  Don't waste your money. (I gave it one star only because no stars is not an option. 
 Once again I have to disagree with every other reviewer.   Greek Homosexuality is a strange book. It is also infuriating. I was never able to read an entire chapter of it. I threw it several times in the garbage can and then went out again to retrieve it because I thought I should know more about Greek gays. But the fact is that the more I read the less I understood what Greek homosexuality was. My own take is that the writing of Greek Homosexuality is an extreme case of a rampant scholarly disease called "not seeing the forest because of the trees".   If you want to buy this book because you are anxious to know whether homosexuality was widespread in ancient Greece and whether it was really accepted as a normal form of sexual behavior, let me tell you that the author has no definite answer to these two crucial questions. These are the kind of general questions he eludes or is honest enough to leave unanswered because the evidence is unconclusive. I spoke of honesty, but I sometimes put down the fuziness of all this to a wrong understanding of what it means to be objective. To be objective doesn't mean to just align dozens and dozens of pottery fragments and ancient author quotes and other scholarly references and then leave the reader to decide what this all means.   As I have just said, Greek Homosexuality is replete with hundreds of details about homosexuality in art, in law, in philosophy, in language. But the trouble is that it is almost  completely devoid of enlightening syntheses. Therefore every time I read a few pages in this book, I ended up knowing less about homosexuals in ancient Greece than when I took it up. This sounds incredible, yet it is true. I have tried to read the whole book several times, but simply wasn't able to. I keep getting lost in thickets of disconnected details while the myriad qualifications with which they are hedged about and the dry and technical language get the better of all my intellectual machettes.   Therefore my conclusion is: Greek Homosexuality is un-rea-da-ble! But I will gladly admit that the numerous black and white photographs of male nudes depicted in Greek art are gorgeous and give the reader a fleeting sense of understanding the whole mess of details in the rest of the book.   Touto biblion ouk esti kalon...   
 Flipping through this book I found it to be yet another disturbing study in "making history into whatever you want it to be" just by writing it. It teaches children basically a pack of garbage that can not be verified by any scientific principle of any sort. Brainwashing young children into believing this filth, Ken Ham you are a monster. Your books are paranoid reactionary lunacy revolving around the "Darwinian conspiracy" which by the way doesn't exist. Darwinian racism? Darwinian socialism? Darwin was a scientist not a public offical or a philosopher. He used scientific method to support his theories. Ham you are either a nutt, or just one more money grubbing fiends that are out to make a buck on peoples lack of education. Nuff said 
 That's a direct quote from O'reilly. Instead he prefers to make inflammatory statements and and a lot of  misleading suggestions. It's hard to know what he actually likes, because he appears to make a living based on negativity and rage. (bad guys, ad nauseum). It's all tedious angry white male "daddy knows best" posturing. He wants his readers to see him as he sees himself: a tough oh-so-virile guy, who's true to his working class roots, despises privelege, and is grossly insulted by lables, e.g. "conservative."  When he dislikes, he rages, e.g. single mothers, George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Whitney Houston. He despises the Clintons, but he's hard pressed after all the revelations about the Arkansas Project to say why they are amoral so he just tells you they spend a lot of money, (which actually pales in comparison to Reagan and the noaccountability whopping spending of G.W., but he doesn't tell you that.) He dogs Bill Moyers ad nauseum.    Aside from rage, the book contains a lot of weird, frightening illogical stuff. He believes teenagers who were caught in the act should have been "publicly disciplined" (??) He believes Clinton's Torricelli deal led to 9/11 (&doesn't mention anything else that might have.) He tells Phil Donahue, that if he was in charge, he "would not target the civilians of Afghanistan, but bomb the infrastructure" of the country. (Huh? bombing the infrastructure does kill civilians.) He's obsessed with sex offenders and child abuse, which is weird given his own record. He's obsessed with "immorality" in the media & society, & its really disturbing the way the way he targets celebrities who are black as paragons of "immorality. " There is nothing enjoyable about this book. It's bleak. It's negative and twisted. The book is so grotesque, it's not even amusing to read as satire of a right wing ideologue 
 Wow, for a series which started off with a strong independent older female character, Miss Julia has really really let herself go. I knew it would be the 'kiss of death' for Julia to get married, (this time to 'too good to be true' Sam Murdoch), and I'm sad to say I was right. Miss Julia's problems in this book are all in her head. Her silly dithering about her marriage, her jealous obsession over Sam and other women and her silly worrying about whether she is  married or not, are so unlike the practical sensible widow, I have to sigh.  I'm sorry to say it, but if Miss Ross is to revitalize the series, she'd need to do something drastic. Such as A: Dump Sam (sorry, never liked the character. Miss Julia needs a bad boy, not a saint), B: do something about the Mr. Pickens situation, C: and get something *real* for Miss Julia to worry about rather than herself. When I saw the title of this book, I thought Miss Julia *might* be getting herself a new hobby. Unfortunately, the title is misleading.  Might be worth picking up at the library, but definitely the worst in the series. I was *so* disappointed 
 This book is way too short for such an interesting topic. Another problem is that it depicts women as main victims of weird medical practices in 19th and early 20th century, which is not entirely true. At those times (and may be true today in some cases also) one would be far better off if one stayed away from medical profession. Also, there are some really hillarious things about treating hysteria which authors didnot bother to mention. For the hystory of vibrators as legitimate medical treatment for hysteria, Rachel Maines has done very good job in dealing with this topic. What is also a pity is that authors didn't pursue various medical superstitions about females and different treatment of females which are present in modern times. For example, nobody questions the articles published in peer reviewed medical journal which state that patient's absolute refusal is "relative contraindication" for performing episiotomy. Is there any other surgical procedure which can be inflicted on a patient against patient's explicitly stated wishes? Or for example the fact that many health insurances cover Viagra but don't cover contraceptives. There are many topics well worth investigation which belog to the topic "Complaints and Disorders : The Sexual Politics of Sickness" which authors have chosen not to address in this pamphlet (can't even call it a book) 
 Lipstadt is patently an intelligent author, and some of her in depth analyses bring some discrepancies to light, statistical and other, in the works of David Irving. However, any historian, journalist, or writer in general could be found to have an equal level of faults in their works.   Irving is one of the integral historians of WW2 and Nazism. His research has probably brought more new evidence and data to light than any single historian of this era. The bibliography of any work of note on this period in history will contain references to Irving's work. The vast amounts of data, and the unique and varied nature of his sources, have made his contribution priceless.    Lipstadt criticises his fluctuating figures, on, say the victims of Dresden. Yes, his estimates have varied, but then history in general is prone to evolution, rarely are such figures maintained as 100% accurate as decades pass. Especially the field Irving works in - what with the cold war, massive amoutns of integral material laid hidden for years, even decades.    I would also state the statistics of Auschwitz victims have fallen from 6 million to less than 1 million in the last 50 years, very gradually. This represents much wider change than Irving's figures, and illustrates the evolution of historical analysis.    The scariest part of this whole book/trial is that the expert historians who testified against Irving were paid £500,00. Very, very sinister. History, indeed, on trial. And if you're reading of it differs from what it's supposed, prepare to face annihalation. Remember Salman Rushdie and Iran? People in America and Europe decried the 'backward and fanatical' Iran for attacking the author. Look closer to home, and be very afraid.. 
 I wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as I can to help keep the shot stable (I shoot birds at 700mm). The first thing my friend and I did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc. - one with, one without, the extender.  Result: - the image appeared the same size, and the extender slightly blurred the image. In other words - completely useless 
 "Splinter of the Mind's Eye" is the very first Star Wars novel set in the Expanded Universe.  The only Star Wars book before "Splinter" is the novelization of "Star Wars", also written by Alan Dean Foster.  Because this book came out before there was even a script for "The Empire Strikes Back", things happen in the book that doesn't quite jive with what we know from "Empire" and "Jedi".  I'm not sure there is a direct contradiction, but the story fits better into the Star Wars Universe when the reader knows that this novel was written without any knowledge of "The Empire Strikes Back".  Think of "Splinter" as, perhaps, the red-headed stepchild of the Star Wars novels.    This novel takes Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa and puts them on a diplomatic mission for the Rebellion to a planet which has some sympathizers.  On their way to this planet, the ship Luke and Leia are on crash lands on a primitive jungle planet occupied by the Empire, human miners, and a host of strange alien creatures.  As Luke soon learns, it is also the home of the Kaiburr Crystal, a crystal which magnifies the power of Force Users.  In the hands of the Empire this crystal could be a dangerous tool and weapon.  Since Luke and Leia have no idea how to get off the planet with their damaged ship, they decide to search for this crystal.  The novel gives a fairly fast paced, though simple, adventure story featuring run-ins with Imperial Stormtroopers, natives, and Darth Vader in a face off that foreshadows what will come in future movies.    "Splinter" suffers from being a little bit on the cheesy side, as if it were geared to a younger audience.  It also suffers from the timing in which it was written, namely before George Lucas had conceived of "The Empire Strikes Back".  This last part isn't the fault of Alan Dean Foster or the novel itself, but this does affect the perceptions of someone reading the book in 2005.  Knowing what we do about the characters, the budding romance between Luke and Leia is a bit uncomfortable (as it still is looking back at "A New Hope" and how Luke looks at Leia).    This isn't an exceptionally good novel even by Star Wars standards, but it is a time capsule of where the Star Wars novels came from and as the first Extended Universe novel, it's interesting in that perspective.  There's really no other reason to read this book, though, as it doesn't tie into any other Star Wars novel (or movie) or fill in any gaps left by a Star Wars novel.    -Joe Sherr 
 	Linda Lawrence Hunt must have had a time machine.  She chronicles Helga and Clara Estby's 1896 walk from Washington State to New York City in her 336 page book Bold Spirit.  She did so, even though all were unavailable to her.  Helga Estby, a Norwegian immigrant, keep many detailed journals during and after her journey, but her family burned them out of spite and shame.  Helga Estby walked across America to receive $10,000.  She planned to use it to pay off the debts she and her husband Ole and their ten children had accumulated.  Or so says Linda Lawrence Hunt.   	Bold Spirit is ten percent fact and ninety percent speculation.  Gleaning from only a few newspaper articles, public records, and a few interviews, Hunt manages to produce a considerably long piece of what she calls non-fiction.  For all we know, Estby planned to use the money to open up an opium den.  Just because the Estby's were struggling financially and Helga was offered $10,000 doesn't mean she planned to use the money to pay off debts.  Sometimes people do things that don't make sense.   	Hunt's "primary sources" are questionable.  Biased and inaccurate press is as much of an American tradition as hot dogs and beer, and it was especially rampant in Victorian America, as literacy rates and newspaper production rates were increasing but rules about unbiased media hadn't been established.  While periodicals help supplement a biographical account, they should not be the foundation of it.  Because time makes memories fade, interviews of family and friends are just as inaccurate. 	Hunt assumes the political views of Estby and her daughter.  She assumes that Helga was a feminist.  Had Helga been as strong of a woman as Hunt portrays, perhaps she would have written a book about her walk, like she had planned.  Perhaps she wouldn't have taken her nineteen-year-old daughter with her on the 3,500-mile walk.  Perhaps she would have opened up a school or started speaking to the community about her walk.  Estby becomes incredibly apathetic after the walk; perhaps she was depressed because of the death of two of her children while she was away.  Perhaps because she and Ole were never able to fix their relationship after she was away for so long.  Perhaps it was because she was raped or hurt on the trip.  No one knows, not even Linda Lawrence Hunt.  This kind of speculative "non-fiction" should not become a precedent in the historical world. 	This book would have been enjoyable if it were historical fiction.  Hunt could have used her imagination as much as she wanted to do pretty much what she did in Bold Spirit: fill in the gaps left by the documents.  She could have spruced up the story and added plot twists.  Her writing style is insultingly simplistic. 	I would recommend this book to a fifth grader.  The writing style is easy enough to understand.  The plot is basic.  On the surface, it is an encouraging tale about a bold, courageous woman.  But anyone interested in historical integrity, an interesting story, or reading anything past a fourth grade reading level should probably stay far far away from Bold Spirit 
 This direct to video release is another one of those rich people who die and leave their fortunes to the family pet and one of the relatives decides to kidnap the dog and demand a ransom and/or get ownership by making the kindhearted guardian look irresponsible.  It's been done a lot of times and this is not one of the more successful attempts. Dean Cain doesn't look comfortable in his role as a bespectacled nerdish kind of guy; Dean needs to stay in action movies where his good looks and physique are better utilized.  Tim Curry and Jennifer Tilly chew up the scenery shamelessly and although they're fun for a while, their shenanigans become redundant and overused.  Bailey is a pretty dog and the kids are insufferably cute, but the movie is really rather boring.  For younger kids only 
 This book was written ( I bet)by unpaid graduate assistants. I borrowed it from the library to read before mr Fukuyama's arrival to speak at a university. The book was "written to order" to appeal to American conservatives. If Mr Fukuyama had really wanted to write about the construction/maintenance/increasing/decreasing of TRUST he could not have pointedly ignored the European Union. Nations and peoples with a thousand or more years of organised warfare are now at peace and trying to work together now that's an exercise in TRUST BUILDING. I asked Mr Fukuyama why, as the book doesn't have America in the title, did he only mention distrust in medieval Italy and not the phenominal TRUST required to bring Germans, Brits and the French together. His reply "Oh .. people always want me to talk about their country. Next question." well!.... I feel that this book is a dis service to Americans because as with so many political/cultural and economic books from the USA what is left out of the book adds to the hurly burly spiral of disinformation accepted as the truth about the world by many Americans and esp. uncrital conservatives. I am, of course by my own reckoning, a conservative - a mixed economy democratic christian from the U.K.(OK OK New Labour) So I am not hostile to the US, but this type of book and the supportive reviews sadden me. Good luck America and PLEASE read wider and TRAVEL 
 Being a huge fan of KitchenAid products, I was happy to see this item at Target.  When I took it out of the bag at home, I noticed a chip on the edge and a crack starting to run the length of the side. (The item was not broken when I purchased it. It must've broken when my daughter dropped it on the driveway.)  The plastic is hard, not flexible. Very disappointed in this KitchenAid product 
 Unfortunately, I ordered this book without first browsing through it at a store.  I was hoping for some innovative in-the-round patterns that would help me make better-fitting sweaters.  Instead, the book is full of shapeless designs with no waist definition. (I suppose I could figure out the increases and decreases to do waist shaping on my own, but the reason I buy pattern books is to reap the benefits of someone else already having done that!)  Virtually all of the designs have simple drop sleeves with minimal shaping, so that the sleeves bag at the top.  There is only one sweater in the book that I would consider making.  The photography is adequate, except that the same model is used to show every sweater, so it's hard to get a sense of how the designs might look on different body types.  I have to say that I wasted my money on this one 
 Confuses Calvinistic moral posturing with honesty. Extremely poorly researched or evidence that didn't match cherished beliefs of the target market was omitted in order to increase sales to that niche 
 Nice listening and partying music from a seemingly low-brow but funny and wise movie 
 This is not a book, it's a piece of trash!!! This so called book is a meaningless mess which wasn't even understandable for the person who had a PhD in math and was teaching our class. Do NOT bother with this nonsense. if you want to learn something just read Ordinary Differential Equations by V. I. Arnold.I would have given no star if I could!!!Just go with Arnold's and I'll be WAY better off 
  I was so relieved to see that other bakers were disappointed with this book. The recipes SEEM as if they'd be good, but they're so disappointing, and the directions were overly confusing. I was once a professional baker and I found this book a big ol' waste of my money. The little guide to cookies has better recipes for much less dough 
 Day is superior to both Night and Dawn, the first two books in Elie Wiesel's Night trilogy. However, six aspects of Day really bug me:  First, Day's plot lacks cohesion and is out of chronological order, unlike Night and Dawn. The heart of a novel should either consist of either solid storytelling and an advancing plot or delicately crafted interwoven stories. In Day, it is instead largely a jumble of disparate memories - typically of women in steamy situations. This is not conducive to seamless communication.  Second, Wiesel originally wrote The Accident separately from Dawn and Night. As such, it is the least connected to the other two books. He decided at some point to change the title to Day, tack it on to his first two books, and call the resulting mumbo-jumbo a "trilogy." This is sloppy, self-centered, and ultimately irritating because now students at my school are required to read all three volumes.  Third, my same old complaint about Wiesel's writing holds true in Day: too much crying! I find it absurd how many times people cry in the Night trilogy - readers of Night and Dawn (as many of you readers this review are) can attest to this. Rather than making his readers more sympathetic to the feelings of his characters, Wiesel conditions them to indifference with this blatant overuse of sadness.  Fourth, Wiesel's comparisons in Day are too often uncreative at best, stale at worst. Too often he compares one woman to another, typically his mother or grandmother. Comparing one woman to another does nothing. These comparisons would be acceptable once or twice, but, one's patience wears thin after reading paragraph after paragraph of them. Wiesel should keep in mind that he is writing to other people who did not grow up with these women. Much more interesting and effective would be to compare the women to romantic inanimate objects such as the sun, the moon, or a budding rose.  Fifth, Wiesel shies away from many chances to show us a lurking literary prowess throughout Day. These opportunities crop up whenever somebody "talked for hours." It's hard to imagine that these terse, two-dimensional characters are really capable of speaking for hours without seeing the monologue on paper. Why does Wiesel hold these soliloquies back from us?  Sixth, and last, Wiesel doesn't vary his sentence structure enough, in Day or either of the other books in his Night trilogy. This is a run-of-the-mill high school error, and I'm surprised that neither he, nor Oprah, nor the legions of devoted oprah&wiesel fans pick up on this. His short, choppy sentences should be reserved those rare pulse-pounding moments, but Wiesel uses them everywhere.  I will quote from the text to illustrate my points:  Kathleen's face was twisted with pain. She looked like a sorceress who has lost her true face from having put on too many masks. A great fire burned around her. Suddenly she cried out and began to sob. My mother, I had never seen my mother cry. (p.74)  Kathleen. Tears were coming to her eyes. My mother didn't cry. At least not when other people were there. She only offered her tears to God. Kathleen looked a little like my mother; she had her high forehead, and her chin had the same pure lines. But Kathleen wasn't dead. And she was crying. (p.89)  These selections are the concluding paragraphs of two back-to-back chapters. And yet they say the same thing. That's not any kind of plot advancement that I've ever heard of. I hung my head upon reading the following, though I agree with it:  Nothing is more sacred than life, or healthier, or greater, or more noble. To refuse life is a sin; it's stupid and mad. You have to accept life, cherish it, love it, fight for it as if it were a treasure, a woman, a secret happiness. (p.67)  This "profound" realization flies in the face of what the narrator previously thought - that life wasn't worth fighting for. However, I knew that "life is all we have" before I even knew who Wiesel was. I know we humans must simultaneously struggle for our lives while still finding time to cherish them. I don't need an emotionally-estranged Holocaust-survivor narrator to take me by the hand and lead me through the way he discovered that truth, which is essentially the only task that Day accomplishes for society. Day certainly doesn't make one happier, unless one derives pleasure from knowing one can write better than a Nobel Peace Prize winner. I cannot speak for how this book affects other readers, however. Perhaps this book will save someone from suicide someday?  I will make you suffer though one more irresistible passage before I quit:  In the beginning she didn't cry. We were on the same level. We dealt with each other like equals. We were free. Each one free from himself and free from the other. When I didn't feel like keeping a date, I didn't. She did the same. And neither of us was angry or even hurt. When I didn't talk for a whole night, she didn't try to make me explain. The familiar question asked by lovers, "What are you thinking about?" didn't enter our conversations. Hardness had become our religion. Nothing was said that wasn't essential. We tried to convince each other that we could live, hope, and despair, alone. Each kiss could have been the last. At any moment the temple could have collapsed. The future didn't exist since it was useless. At night we made love silently, almost like our own witnesses. A stranger watching us in the street could easily have taken us for enemies. Rightly so, perhaps. True enemies aren't always the ones who hate each other. (p.90)  I prefer that my novels not read like Chicken Soup for the Soul.  Gyula arrives near the end of the book, providing the comic relief and fog-cutting outsider's insight that the rest of Wiesel's Night trilogy needed so desperately to keep from being the bore that it was. In Gyula's laughing light and portrait-mirror, the narrator sees himself for who he truly has become and discovers that he needs to change his outlook. Day was a more satisfying novel than either Night or Dawn in part due to this resolution and promised change in attitude.  I have concluded my reading of the Night trilogy, and of Wiesel, for good. I can't wait to discuss this trilogy in English class - fur will fly, for sure, as most readers of Wiesel whom I've met become insta-fans. I will conclude by saying this - if you enjoyed Night and Dawn, then Day will be right up your alley 
 I tried to stay focused on this book.  I even read every single page to make sure that I didnt miss anything.  This book was absolutely HORRIBLE.  I think this book was published just to get money from people who actually believe in this author.  I dont think many people have done research on this women.  First of all she comes from a family who was not rich but had enough money to help her get started.  Then with her divorce I'm sure she was taken care of financially to get her businees up and running.  My main problem with the book is how poorly it related to the so called "Black Woman".  Me being a black woman myself  I can tell you first hand nothing she dipicts in this book would be helpful in getting yor money straight.  She mentions how knowing the way your elders handled their money would help you to get your money straight.  I just dont get how the way my grand dad, and grand mom, handled their money then would relate to me getting MY money straight now?? Then she mentions something about having to give money to the church to be a more rounded person? Well if you barely have enough money which is why your supposed to be getting your money straight in the first place, how on earth are you supposed to have enough to give away to the church? I thought the book would deal with more REAL PEOPLE with REAL SITUATIONS.  This book might be beneficial to someone that makes alot of money and just blows it away on stupid things.  I know the author sure makes a REAL NICE SALARY 
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 I don't like this stupid book! It only teaches kids that "strangers" are bad people that wanna hurt you for fun, and the only "nice" people are the people you know. A kid in my brother's kindergarten class was too afaid to leave his house because of this book. They should of changed the title to "The Berenstain Bears Learn About Demented Killing Strangers. 
 This complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone-star movie.  With cringingly awful acting, laughable special effects (the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment), appalling dubbed dialogue, cheesy music, inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere, The Grim Reaper is a total disaster.   Don't waste your money on this turkey. 
 Definitly not worth the money. I thought it was poorly written and really did not have any new informatin in it that was not in any of my basic text books. Quite disappointed 
 This book is......well, frankly, it's a piece of sh*t. It communicates the idea that punk was a fad that happened from 1975-1979 and then ended when the truth is that the punk culture is still alive and thriving today.  Bands like the Dropkick Murphys, Dirty Water, Bouncing Souls, and many many lesser-known bands in your local scenes are still out there and performing the music, living the life, and keeping the scene alive in the original punk spirit. There's so few books published about punk rock that it makes me sick to see people wearing blinders and ignorant of the true status of punk publishing one 
 The reader expects to see some useful applications of feminist theory to ancient texts, but the expectation is in vain 
 Hands down, this book is the most idiotic Christian propaganda I have ever read 
 I always use this book as an example of what's wrong with much of the humanities. I hope people who take this stuff seriously take the time to read some rebuttals. The fact that "truth" is a philosophically difficult concept really doesn't in any way change the spectacular achievements of the scientific method. That most of the foundations of science were built by white males is a historical accident. The discoverers of deep science may have benefited from a twisted social order, but the whole world has benefited from their work. More to the point, Maxwell's equations or Newton's laws would not be substantially different if discovered by a Balinese woman, they would just have a different name. No amount of pseudointellectual babble will change that. It's, sorry, a fact 
 This is a horrible example of sophmoric "witty" commentary paired with the idiocy of stat-based evaluation. If irrelevant asides were not enough, they are mostly wrong as regards players from the team I follow closely, the Oakland A's. Take the notes on Houston Street ("never will be in the Lidge/Rivera class"), Zito ("overrated"), minor leaguer Travis Buck (stupid comments on his name, totally inappropriate), Ander Ethier (overmatached in the big leagues). Where their prognastications are reasonable, a simple extrapolation from previous years (anyone could do it in their head) would suffice, not some pseudo sophisticated computer program. I hate this book 
 I read the first 5 series and loved it, 6 and 7 was ok but was getting a little tiring.  Now that I've read 8, I am just going through the motion of finishing out the series (I have a thing about finishing series).    In the first 5 books, Stephanie's bumbling and misadvantures seemed cute and believable.  But by the 8th book you'd think she would tell her cop boyfriend about people threatening her, notify the proper people for help at the appropriate time, and for christ sake don't go into the house the mob boss tell her not to go into!  I honestly don't blame Morelli for not wanting to marry her, and I don't see what her appeal is to both men like Ranger and Morelli.  This almost reinforces the stereotype that men, even smart men like Morelli and Ranger, likes ditzy bimbos.    I have never seen anyone so stupid and so lacking of survival skills.  You'd think after all the death threats and close calls she's had in the first 7 books, Stephanie would carry her gun and not leave it at the cookie jar.  If she hates guns so much, quit being a bounty hunter.  I find myself screaming in the book "move you dummy", this has gotten irritating and annoying to read.    And the love triangle between her and Morelli and Ranger is just unbelievable.  Why would they men want her?  She's a mess and she lacks any real charm that I can see.  She hides secrets from them and I find the way she lusts after one guy soon after the other leaves the room to be dispicable.  If she loves Morelli so bad she should quit all the kissing and petting (oh and having sex) with Ranger.  When Morelli doesn't give her the time of the day because they broke up she goes all pouty and make it sound like it's Morelli's fault.  Hello!  If Morelli found out she had sex with Ranger she'd never see him again 
 I never got this book and I have tried numerous time to get my money back and I have only gotten the runaround. Why wont you respond to the fact that I never got this book and is anything going to be done about it. 
 The credibility of this book has now been destroyed- see "Margaret Mead and Somoa" by Derek Freeman for proof- most serious academics now see this book as an emberassment, a bad joke perpetrated by an eager to please twenty three year old neophyte in the grip of ambition and groupthink.  A heady mixture indeed Ms. Mead.... The noble savage you say?  The malleability and innate goodness of human nature you say?  History now points an unwavering finger and pronounces you a liar.  What a shameful legacy. 
 I am very disappointed in Baby Einstein.  This video has several different languages, none of which were Italian!  I even wrote a letter to Baby Einstein expressing my disappointment.  I think that Italian is a beautiful language that many people wish to learn and to leave it out of this video is unforgivable.  I no longer support Baby Einstein products.  
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 I just got webkinz for my kid last week. He loves his puppy webkinz very much. However, this website keeps all kids hooked on. What bothers me the most is some pop-up games that allure him to play to keep coming back webkinz site daily in order to earn kinz kash (virtual money of this website). One of the gimmick that this website entices your kid addicts to them is similar to gambling websites, and they really do have a game that no different from the slot machine!! This makes my jaw drop seeing what he is playing!! I couldn't believe it!! Beware your kid might be learning how to play a slot machine at the very early age when you let them enter webkinz website unsupervised!! My wife need to pull him out and tell him that this is not good for kid to play something like a slot machine or gambling-like games, even though it's originate from the webkinz website. Please make sure that parents always have to supervise your kids when you let play webkinz online. This website is not 100% safe for kids. They seem to have a hidden agenda in alluring your kids to become addicted to their games and their sites in order to make sure that your kids will keep their membership once their first yr member expires. Some (or Most) of their games are non-educating games and really not much different from the gambling websites. This webkinz website is not safe for kids. Beware of addiction, and crave for earning more kinz kash which makes it indifferent from gambling websites! 
 Like every review before mine, my order was wrong as well. The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated. I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design....yes it's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund. I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner. Is this just another big uncaring corporation? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again 
 E.P. Sanders makes quite a few compelling and controversial arguments in this book.  It has been hailed by many as a great work despite its brevity and I can see why, since it brings a lot of new insight on a pillar of the Christian church.  His thesis: Paul is convinced he has received a message of salvation for humankind through Christ - this message frees us from the law and Paul is willing to use Scripture in flexible ways to validate that message and his own authority to proclaim it. What specifically sets Sanders opinion apart is that he believes Paul's mission has much more to do with Paul's belief in himself and his message and much less to do with what Paul actually can pull from Scripture.  In other words, Paul has an agenda that seems to go beyond just proclamation of God's Word and into proclamation of Paul's authority and the importance of validating his own mission (and conversion).   As a Pharisee, Paul's education in Scripture was paralleled by few.  He was a walking Scriptural lexicon.  E.P. Sander's argues that Paul used his mastery of Scripture to his advantage.  He used `proof texts' from Scripture in order to prove his argument without regard to the original meaning of the passage.  Paul was "not concerned with the meaning of the biblical passages in their own ancient context" (page 66).   Does this sound like the author who has a high view of Paul or Scripture?  Is this the man you want teaching you about Paul?  Not me, thus the 2 stars.  I give it 2 stars because it's nice to see the "New Perspective on Paul" in all of it's glory and in E.P. Sanders' case, that "New Perspective" means a lower view of Scripture and a higher view of himself. 
 I smell a rat here. This book is obviously produced by someone who don't want the truth about the Roswell incident to come out 
 I guess I should have listened to the title of this book a little more before I wasted my money on it.  This book is written for 12-16 year olds that have little or no knowledge of sex.  It has the most elementary stuff in it that even a person living on an island by themselves their whole lives could figure out.  I thought when I bought this book the author would be talking about techniques that would actually help achieve "amazing sex" as it said in the title.  Um think again.  It's like the author had some sort of agenda while writing this book.  She states that is normal to have "rape fantasies" and discusses "how to be comfortable being gay".  It is not normal to have rape fantasies and as for being comfortable with your sexuality I agree it is necessary for good sex, but don't waste my time with a whole chapter on it.  Honestly it's just false advertising naming the book "The complete idiot's guide to Amazing Sex", it should be called "The complete idiot's guide to the Basics of Sex from a leftist agenda."  There is nothing in this book that will help the reader achieve "amazing sex", just the basics that any simpleton could figure out.  Don't waste your money unless you're still in junior high 
 I unfortunately could not get through this book. T.R just went on and on, getting a bit carried away with his own wit and literary skills. I wish  I could write a better review, but I can't get past the second chapter. Perhaps further on down the road I will give it another try. In the meantime I recommend all Tom's other novels. 
 The first few chapters were a breeze, then WHAMO! into no-mans land. Like the reviewer before me wrote, it suddenly gets way too complicated and decides this is a good time to leave out any descriptions of code 
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 There's a new edition of Jane Austen's complete novels that's better value than this one, you might want to take a look at it - the ISBN number is:  0954840119  (put this into the Amazon search box and it'll come up). 
 I was hoping for a book that had actual plans and dimensional drawings of various coops.  Instead, this book is more of an "ideas" book or a grand tour of various coops that people have built.  Definitely a disappointment 
 Before reading this book, I was extremely cautious to avoid any information/review which might spoil and prejudice my opinion.  In that I was successful.  It had been a while since reading the other four books, so they were not on my mind and in fact I worried about forgetting minor plot points and whether that would affect my enjoyment.  I needn't have worried.  There was nothing enjoyable about Mostly Harmless.  I was overwhelmed by a sense of bitterness coming from the prose, found myself wondering, "Does he even *like* these characters?"  It struck me as the work of a man who hated what he was doing and wanted to kill it in the most complete and irrevocable way possible.  Two stars for occassional flashes of the non-bitter Adams 
 I had previously read Fred Allen Wolf's "Parallel Universes" and was intrigued to read about his quantum understanding of the soul.  "The Spiritual Universe" begins with a detailed review of the opinions of Plato, Aristotle, and Buddha, among others, concerning the nature of the soul.  Apparently Wolf hasn't heard of a fellow named Jesus Christ who did not make the cut for any historical quotes on the nature of the soul.  Then again, maybe he had some graduate students doing the heavy lifting work on the book and we all know that physics majors generally aren't known for being well-rounded in the academic sense.  Honestly, I found this introduction incredibly tedious rather than enlightening.  At the time it seemed like Wolf had arrived at his final conclusions about the nature of the soul while drinking a decaf caramel Macchiato at Starbucks one day and merely required some filler material, much like a typical, well padded undergraduate thesis.  Plodding through this book requires two talents: the tenacity of a polar icebreaker coupled with the gin guzzling gusto of the former captain of the Exxon Valdez.  Laboriously cutting through the book like a Toro like a lawnmower with a dull blade, it seemed like I was on a scavenger hunt seeking something resembling substance.  To be fair-minded, Wolf does say in his first sentence that this is not an easy book for a scientist to write.  He sure delivered on that statement.    Several credible topics were entirely lacking in his tapioca-thick tome.  First, it would seem incredibly intuitive that the average person might equate spirit, or soul, with the concept of ghost.  Spirits have been the cornerstone of human mythology, tradition and folklore throughout history.  I was mildly interested if Prof. Wolf had any insights from the study of quantum physics that might shed some light on why peoples from all cultures have reported seeing spirit or ghost manifestations.  This topic was never addressed.  Equally disappointing was the fact that Wolf completely ignored any discussion of out-of-body experiences (OBEs), near death experiences (NDEs), or after death communications (ADCs) as evidence of a spiritual or soul state.  There is an amazing amount of fascinating literature on these subjects.  On a purely personal level, it is difficult to not find at least one person at a cocktail party that has not had some kind of unusual or deeply spiritual experience being reunited with a recently deceased loved one, most frequently during the dream state.  I would have been greatly interested in learning what light quantum theory might shed on the viability of ADCs.   Could heaven be a parallel universe created from the void by conscious thought?  One of the great centers for scientific study for evidence of the continuance of consciousness, the life of the soul after the death of the body, is at Human Energy Systems Laboratory at the University of Arizona.  Wolf mentions that he spoke at a conference there yet never discusses any aspect of the academic work on the viability of consciousness after death of the body by scientists like Dr. Gary Schwartz or others.  It begs the question, how does one write a scientific examination of the soul without addressing the current research being conducted on the subject?   Wolf saves his best for last with his discourse on Bass's Proof and the story about something called Robotina.  To be fair, Wolf does warn the reader that he had simplified the material in chapters 7-12 to make it a bit easier to digest.   Well, if you can get through the story of Robotina without drinking the bong water and inserting flaming bamboo slivers under your fingernails you've got my admiration.  Sadly, this book is a feckless stinker that will render insensible even the most ardent readers.  In the words of Clara Peller, "Where's the beef?"   I only recommend the book if you are suffering from  acute insomnia and need something innocuous to help kick in the effects of a Nyquil Rusty Nail cocktail to promote a restful nights sleep. 
 I'm not one to enjoy buying a pack of 50 CD's and having to throw half of them away because the drive can no longer read them.  They deteriorate quickly 
 As a photographer working with available light only, I bought this book hoping to learn to ins and out of flash photography.  A few pages into it realized that this book wasn't the one. The first chapter covers the fundamentals of flash operation -  how does flash work and the basic concepts to remember, and that was VERY helpful. But it was written sluggishly, which  made the reading tiresome, confusing, and un-exciting.   It's down-hill after that. I found later chapters to be off the subject, or irrelevant, or too general. For example, I didn't need to read about the difference between portrait photography and photojournalism photography, or the different style of people photography - I just wanted to know how to apply flash in both - and this information was missing, or too shallow. I had to fish for the relevant information among lots information that repeated itself but wasn't interesting, like the different types of camera that use flashes. The information I was looking for, like specific techniques and ideas, was scattered throughout the book in an unorganized matter, if at all.   The sample pictures were mediocre, at best, stuff that I wouldn't even consider showing my friends... Seriously, I was surprised to find pictures like this in a photography book. I didn't learn how to take good flash pictures in different situations, I didn't learn how to apply different techniques of flash photography to take special or interesting pictures, and I didn't learn anything that my flash or camera manual wouldn't teach me.   I wish I could return it to the book store, but I threw away the receipt. Very, very disappointing, not the book for anybody who has been using a camera for more than a few weeks. If this is the first time you've seen a camera, maybe. For everyone else - waste of time and money 
 The South is where it is at right now, whether you like it or not.  Despite the ongoing East Coast and West Coast domination of the 80s and 90s, 2000 and beyond was all about the hip-hop scene below the Mason-Dixon line.  Sure there were a lot of rap artists making noise before 2000 like Outkast, Goodie Mob, Geto Boys, UGK, and the No Limit and Cash Money camps.  But the new millenium has seen the explosion of the Dirty South, leaving everybody else scratching their heads.  There have even been comparisons of the South's evolution with the rise of the West Coast in the early 90s.  And even though a lot of artists have quality material coming from the South (Paul Wall, Bun B, David Banner, Outkast, Trick Daddy, Slim Thug), there are still a number of acts that simply don't make the grade.  Dem Franchize Boyz are a perfect example of this with their album On Top Of Our Game.  Sure, it helps to have an utter genius like Jermaine Dupri to put your album out during the best possible opportunity in rap history.  Nevertheless, it all comes down to the quality of work and the marketing of that product.  They even had a hit song like "I Think They Like Me (remix)" featuring JD, Da Brat, and Bow Wow debuted months ago (which by the way sounds much like their previous hit "In My White Tee.")  But that's the problem right there....it was months before their album was even released.   Oh, and the song appearing on Young Fly and Flashy months prior didn't help either. The new single "Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It" does very little, but unfortunately it's one of the better songs on the album!  There are a few decent cuts like "My Music" featuring Bun B and maybe "Stop Callin' Me."  But besides those cuts and the hidden remix of  "In My White Tee", there isn't much else that you can even deem listenable!  "Ridin' Rims" will only appeal to those who have a fascination with spinners and the pimped-out rides.   Three Six Mafia fans will enjoy the group's vocals on "Don't Play With Me," but again you already have to be a fan of their music to appreciate that song.  "Bricks 4 The High" featuring Jim Jones, "You Know What It Is," "Give Props" and "Stop Callin' Me" all just sound uninteresting. "Freaky As She Wanna Be" is purely a stripper slow jam.  "Suckas Come And Try Me" uses the exact same melody from 'White Tee' yet again!  The last track "They Don't Like That" pretty much foreshadows the feelings most will have about this album.  Listening to On Top Of Our Game by Dem Franchize Boyz is bad enough.  Purchasing this 'franchise' for yourself is simply a bad investment 
 I actually enjoyed Jason's outing with Sam Rivers,  who brought some mastery into an otherwise suspect conceptual situation. Jason admits that sometimes he is playing non-sensical phrases in an attempt to be modernistic. Then there's his jive stuff with the tape machine, which I won't elaborate on.   But he really went the distance this time by hiring truly one of the worst guitarists I've ever been  forced to listen to. This Sewell guy does nice things in the background on Cassandra Wilson's various joints,  but leave the soloing to someone else. The resonator bits are tasty enough, but that solo on "I'll Play The Blues" is worse than a high school frequenter of the local music store and his truly lame attempt to  play uptempo free improv is an embarrassment. Maybe "JaMo"(which I agree, is corny) hired this poser to  make him sound better, which he does. Jason has some stuff going on, and his rhythm section is on fire.   But he can, and should do better. Fire the guitar player,  or at least hire any one of the hundred or so players who could contribute something of worth. Sewell is a real stinker on this one. Just awful 
 I've had this Cuinsart for a little over a year, and it's awful!  I can never get the blender unscrewed after using it and it leaks liquid out the bottom everytime I use it.  It also now does not fit on to the base correctly, so it won't even blend now.  It's terrible...I want to throw it against the wall.  Don't buy it 
 This movie smacks of sub-par quality. Unlike its two predecessors which are far superior, Blade III is plagued with a poor script, an unqualified director (sorry, David Goyer is no director), and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace. Think Godfather III in the Godfather series and you'll know why to bypass this awful film. This movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the Blade character in the first two films. Without these attributes, the follow-on action and violence in the film (an artistic staple in the Blade franchise) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you'd expect. What you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters (including Snipes's Blade) who are all dressed up with no where to go. Rated or Unrated, avoid this DVD at all cost. It isn't worth the money or the effort. 
 doesn't do much for the price.  basically your daughter watches the ballet dancers on the tv screen & tries to follow along.  it's not even step by step & frankly it's somewhat difficult to follow.  wish i had spent my $$ on something else.  : 
 I am nine years old and I had to read this book for school. I do not recomend this slow moving, dull book for you. This is more like pre-k reading level. I hope you like my report 
 You'll find better works out there, particularly if you're a Miles fan.   The emphasis here is on Milt Jackson and his vibraphone, which gives the  album a light, airy feeling.  Missing is much of Miles' horn and sentiment.   You also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music.  I would  call this a "pleasant" album, which in my jazz-world is not a  happy thing 
 Like many others in my book group, I had been looking forward to finally reading something by Pamuk. And like most of my book group, I was fairly disappointed by this short early novel from him. Originally published in Turkey in 1985, the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one Faruk Darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a dusty archive. He then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated, but much of it can't. This should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes. Even more so if the reader knows that Darvinoglu is the protagonist of Pamuk's earlier book The House of Silence. Such intertextual tricks immediately bring to mind the works of Calvino, Borges, and their ilk.  The basic plot is very straightforward: in the mid 17th-century, a young Venetian gentleman is captured by Turkish raiders and sold into slavery to an aspiring Turkish scholar who happens to look just like him. The two men then spend the next few decades cloistered together, engaged in various psuedo-intellectual investigations of astronomy, biology, engineering, and so on. These bring them to the attention of the Sultan (based on Mehmet IV), whose patronage waxes and wanes, culminating in a lengthy attempt to construct a powerful war machine. Along the way, their claustrophobic relationship swings back and forth, and is interrupted by an outbreak of the plague, whose outcome they are tasked with predicting. The book concludes with a brief section which will challenge the reader's assumptions and calls into question everything that comes before it. Namely, are there two characters or are they just manifestations of two aspects of a single person?  This all unfolds at a glacial pace, and the two "characters" are mere ciphers. Their clashing of wills and ideas take up page after page, but the reader is always told about the conflict rather than shown it, and this makes for disengaging reading. Pamuk seems much less interested in storytelling or characters than in grand themes such as the nature of identity, the collision of cultures, and the very nature of reality. But none of these are addressed in a way that is particularly fresh or interesting. The tension between East and West is handled in a fairly superficial manner, as the Turkish master is obsessed with Western advances in science and technology, while the Sultan has a credulous appetite for tall tales and soothsayers. This all comes across as a rather ambivalent satire of the fluidity of Turkish national character. In the end, this is not a particularly good introduction to major modern writer whom many have compared to Eco, Calvino, Borges, Kafka, and Kundera. However, readers who enjoy highly ambiguous works about self-identity with unreliable narrators may find this a satisfying read 
 Spare me another movie about how the big bad Catholic Church makes life dull and arduous until everybody is rescued by a sexually liberated Mary Poppins. The film's agenda is all over it and Binoche's character is just too "practically perfect in every way."  
 I found this book at a thrift store for 25 cents. I flipped though it and it looked dated, but interesting, so I decided to get it.  As other reviewers mention, it is dated -- but you gotta know that up front when you get it. It's published in 1986, when there were no (well, almost no) home computers. So you have to accept up front that it's talking about organizing papers using more papers -- but that's something we still all got to do occasionally.  So it's a system of notepads, file folders, etc. It does help you try to understand why you want to keep papers, etc, and what you can do about it. However, it does get overly complex, and really doesn't seem applicable in today's world, where there are far fewer "homemakers" who spend time organizing sewing and recipe files, as this book seems to be focused on.  Finally, I have to mention that it was the continual religion-related references that put me off to the book in the end. Others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it, but for me, I felt I was being preached to a bit too much to find it tolerable. Just my personal taste; I'm sure some others will disagree with this judgement, but I have to admit after enough casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text, I gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin 
 Careful reading reveals the author eliminating the parent as an authority with any rights. In this book, the author tells us that after a 15 yr old girl properly and carefuly consults with caring fellow teens and maybe a high school conselor, [parents exluded] it's fine for her to have sex with a guy for any well chosen reason, at any well chosen time, at any well chosen place. From boy to boy to boy ---.  When she one day gets married,  How Is She To Stop a Behavior She Has Made Such a Habit? Or will her modern husband care? Interesting world 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  Not much better than ideas that could be obtained through a supermarket store magazine article 
 I lost my HP R607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says "auto focus", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.  I really hate it!  Keep Looking...Don't buy this camera 
    I was looking forward to reading this book because of all the praise it recieved.  Perhaps my standards were too high coming into it, but I found this book to be tedious and completely unentertaining.  So many pages could have been removed that added nothing to the story.  I found the main characters personal life to be stereotypical and the story around the old man's biography was a chore to get through.  My recommendation would be to avoid this book, as I felt it was a waste of time. 
 There is so much of this book taken from the work of others, the writers should be embarrased. 
 First off, some of the scenes are beautifully filmed. Rich colors and angles. That's the only good thing, besides seeing Mia Farrow. The deaths are all a little complicated when executed...like a Mouse Trap Game. A roofer bumps a hammer, the hammer slides, hammer falls, striking metal thing on side of building, which swings downward and beheads. A lightening bolt strikes a spire, the spire falls from roof, spears stained glass, impales victim to ground, glass shards rain on the victim. Also, this death was filmed in a gloomy rain storm, but when they show the guy impaled, the gloom has lifted to almost sunny. Immediately.  Another mistake is when the father and the photographer meet a guy in a temple. The guy shows them swords that he unrolls from a canvas case. The dad and the photographer run outside, but the photographer grabs the swords and case and does not roll them back up. Outside, the dad and photographer argue. The dad shakes the case at the photographer and the case is rolled up and the swords put away neatly ina tight bundle. Oops...a goof.  Also, in the extras...the director's vocabulary is pretty rough. He must have been a sailor. Every sentence has the f word 
 Wow, another book on the TG world (anticipation, anticipation)! Then -- letdown. Just imagine how your maiden aunt, or a conservative suburban club-woman, might see the transgendered world of (mostly) early Baby-Boomers as filtered through the observations of a TG-bashing mentor, i.e. the self-styled Canadian "sex scientist" Ray Blanchard. Sorry, it just doesn't live up to its promise as a fitting explication of the subject, and its WAY too short to do so, even had it gone seriously into understanding TG/TS/CD folk.  A work of clever opinion, but little social merit. My significant other and I had a few good laughs over this one 
 I ordered this to give as a gift. I rec'd the package, opened it up and it was completely the wrong thing. Haribo had mislabled the box and what I rec'd was 5 lbs. of sugar coated gummy apples instead. I was very diappointed although Amazon was very understanding and refunded me the total amount. I hesitate to order this item again 
 I bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation.   I feel that most of what I read is simply not factual.  As a person, I feel strongly that I would not want to tell anyone that I knew the author or was his friend.  maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience.  
 The powers that be should have released an "orchestral score only" Apollo 13 soundtrack, as was done for (for example) _L. A. Confidential_.  As it is, James Horner's beautiful, inspiring, and amazing work is obscured by intercutting with dialog and period pop tunes.  As a matter of fact an "orchestral score only" CD was actually compiled and pressed, but distributed to Motion Picture Academy members only for award consideration; it sometimes turns up on ebay. It can be identified by its all black-and-white insert photo. Or, the orchestral score (as released on that CD) plays behind the title menus on the movie DVD.  
 As far as a shoot-um-up with the obligatory car chase goes, this movie did it quite well. And like many of the other "1984" machine churned out films for the proletariat, the title and a few names bear the only resemblance to the Ludlum story. Quite a few of the characters that give this story depth and mystery are left out of the movie completely.    Now let's not compare this quickie in shoot-up land with the well thought out book "The Bourne Identity" by Robert Ludlum or the much better portrait of the story in the Mini-Series "The Bourne Identity" (1988) starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith; then we can enjoy what is left.   A sailor on a fishing trawler spots a human body in the water. After retrieving it we find it is alive. Helping this stranger back from the near dead we find a couple of bullet holes and a mysterious capsule under his skin. The capsule displays what the fisherman recognizes immediately as a Swiss bank account. The man can not remember who he is. Now we follow along with his journey to Switzerland and find out if he will recover. In the mean time someone is out to kill him. Why?    
 A collection of ads and drawings of silverplate patterns.  I have 5 different patterns that we collect.  This book only had 2 of the five 
 This show, as a CD at least, is generic Andrew Loyd Webber with no real high points. It's not bad but as other reviewers have mentioned it's pretty darn familar. I don't have strong feelings about ALW. Most people seem to love or hate him. It seems to me that with the exception of the arguably great EVITA, he's better at coming up with some achingly beautiful songs than completely successful musicals.  The most important point I have to make, however, is that the source material for this show is really first-rate. The Victorian Wilkie Collins was the inventor of the mystery novel and a great suspense novelist. It would be a shame to ruin the suprises in THE WOMAN IN WHITE by listening to this cd before reading the book. It's almost a masterpiece; the musical is just so-so.  One crucial warning, however. Because Collins is now regarded as Literature, the back covers of all his novels and the  introductions and prefaces to them MUST NOT BE READ before you read the novels themselves. A key twist that happens on about page 400 of the 500-page MAN AND WIFE is REVEALED ON THE BACK OF ONE EDITION. The first 100 pages of my personal favorite Collins novel, NO NAME, are enjoyable but not earth-shaking. Then BAM! out of the blue all the pieces fall into place and the book becomes a rollercoaster -- hundreds of pages of almost uninterupted thrills. If you read the back cover in advance  you'll know more or less where the first hundred pages are leading.  Okay, maybe all of the above doesn't belong in a review of this CD -- but you really should give Collins a try. (His later work -- post-1870 -- gets pretty uneven so don't start with that.)  Lastly, David Zippel's lyrics are a real disappointment. By and large they're just passable -- pretty close to the mediocre Don Black. Zippel is usually better 
 As far as production is concerned, this is the best of the Triple Six Mafia underground releases, for the sole purpose that some of the tracks (not all of them) are up to par with the rest of the industry.  There are three or four that sound like they were recorded in the basement, and they don't fit in at all.  However, the album is worth buying just for "Da Summa (Remix)," "Smokin On Da Dro," "Sleep," and "Lock Down."  If you're not a huge Three 6 Mafia fan, save your $ 
 At the end of the documentary, someone says that critics didn't like the movie because they did not understand that Lynch was trying to be expressionist. They did not understand "the juxtaposition of horror and beauty". Needless to say, if you don't like something you just don't like it. I don't care if it is Picasso, Miro, Pollock or your mama.  Art is just like that. You like it or not. If we are to be so snob to just say "Yes! What a wonderful piece of Art. That is Pollock's masterpiece. This goes beyond anything done before", well ... just fine. You are just being snob. But the good thing about art is that we can disagree, and that it is subjective, never objective. I just watched this movie today and I did not like it. Period. I never watched the TV Show (and I never will), and I do not care about Lynch being a talented and special gifted film director. I just don't buy it, and I do not like him. I saw Wild at Heart and Blue Velvet long time ago andI remember them as a little bit better (not too much), but this is not the kind of movies I like. Do not misunderstand me ... the actors are good, the filming is technically good, the plot is not bad at all, but it's just the whole think put together that does not apeal me. I would give this movie a 2 stars and a half, or 5 over 0. I bought it because it is in the 100 Best Movies in DVD by Peter Travers (and I am starting being very disapointed by that book, because I am far from Mr. Travers' tastes). 
 This DVD is advertised as close-captioned, but it is not.  I purchased it for a friend who is deaf and I am disappointed that she cannot enjoy it 
 After more than 2 months waiting I ordered it somewhere els 
 There's not much this film can offer, unless its some cool-looking British sedans and OK to decent character actors. Quyale is utterly wasted. Jayne is, well, Jayne, and the plot is pretty weak. As far as the picture & sound quality, let's not even go there... 
 I was extrememly unhappy with this necklace.  The picture on-line makes it look beautiful with light shining thru the amethyst (ha, looks like cut glass not real amethyst!)/Even putting it up to the natural light it looked dull/fake/plastic.  I emailed and got a reply I would get a full discount just mail it back.  Well, I mailed it back with insurance costing $6.55 after already paying shipping to have it sent to me.  Because I feel it was NOT advertised in a 'correct light' I asked for my shipping back for both charges and disputed the charge with my credit card company.  The refund from Amazon was only the cost of the necklace with neither shipping charge.  I am still going to dispute the the shipping charges because this jewelry did NOT look like it did on the website 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 Tamora Pierce is one of my favorite YA authors -- I own and have reread "The Song of the Lioness" series and "The Immortals" series countless times.  Let's be frank: I *love* Daine. I think she's creative, intelligent, compassionate, imperfect -- everything a person wants in a heroine, really. And I like Numair. I enjoy every aspect of that pair's relationship as student as teacher, as friends, and, I hoped, as lovers.  However. I don't know how, but Tamora Pierce managed to completely botch the entire "lovers" thing. "Realms of the Gods" is both hurried and plodding, both too detailed and too vague, both attentive and dismissive, and the dialogue is atrocious. The enmity between Daine and Ozorne is impossible to take seriously; the Daine/Numair scenes are trashy and trite; the battle scenes are confusing and too fast. Most of the standard secondary characters we've come to know and love -- all the humans of Tortall, Kitten, Cloud -- are almost entirely absent. We see almost none of the promising characters from Emperor Mage, like Lindhall Reed and Prince Kaddar. Daine's shapeshifting and Numair's magic are both unremarkable.  Tamora, Tamora, what went wrong?   Perhaps she was hurrying to reach a deadline.  Anyway, my recommendation is to read the first three books of the "Immortals" series, but just get someone to summarize "Realms of the Gods" for you, because it's not worth the time and disappointment it takes to read it. I've reread it several times over the last, oh, six years, each time hoping it's not as miserable as I remember, and it's always worse. Spare yourself and skip ahead to the first book of "Protector of the Small" 
 If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it 
 I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it.  Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it 
 Since when have comics become a medium for projecting current topical events (drug use, puberty-induced angst, teen pregnancy)?  Morrison is a gifted writer, but its obvious that the guy is trying to kill the title. Things are complicated enough in the X-Men titles (New X-Men, Uncanny X-Men, Ultimate X-Men, Exiles, etc.), but this takes it to a new level.  Who are these people?  What do they bring to the table in terms of advancing the storyline?  Why is Xavier just sitting around and letting his students kill people? And what's with the art?  I can forgive on the condition that this is the same guy who penciled the original Aeon Flux, but thats about it 
 This would probably have been a pretty good book, had the writer chosen to present substance, rather than focusing on being cutesy. The 3" X 3" size, which makes it difficult to read, is a serious distraction 
 All of the glowing conservative reviews of this book seem to leave out one important fact - the author has no qualifications to speak on any of these subjects. John Berlau is a conservative journalist, always has been, always will be. He has no education in science at any level. How does someone write a book about environmental science without any science background?? This book should be better placed in the fiction section of your local bookstore. Of course conservatives love the content of the book. It re-affirms all their tortured logic. This book is one more cornerstone in the conservative movement to undermine modern science. If you like Asbestos and DDT you will love this book. The author acts as if all the peoples of the world would be better off if we allow Dupont to bask us in a shower of their great industrial products. None of the conservative sheep who have placed comments here have given any thought to the reality of what John Berlau is saying. We should bring back Asbestos, DDT, and while we are at how about the Ford Pinto. He never makes the connection that if these industrial products kill people what good are there minimal positive benefits. If the owner of a home with Asbestos dies from cancer what benefit does that owner get from the Asbestos fire retardant agent? The answer of course is none - the fire is a possibility, the cancer is a guarantee. The only beneficairy here is the same one that is paying John Berlau's salary, as well as his employer a.ka.(Heritage Foundation) American Industry. Three cheers for DDT!!!, Three Cheers for Asbestos, Three Cheers for Exxon-Mobil and a final THREE CHEERS for 2009 when all these delusional people will no longer be making public policy. 
 This is a revolutionary book. It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. It's questionable how novel this metaphor is, but this is certianly its first explicit statement. The language used to present the ideas of the author is, like most sociological writing, unecessarily complicated. There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. No sociological background is presupposed, there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources, many footnotes, and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. So if you are interested in reading sociology, this is probably a good place to start (again, the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it's bane as an introduction).  However, the book is misguided. The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.  (The following is a charicature of the author's argument). There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. Well, if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations, infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage, "All the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify" (p 72). The performances can either be with individuals, or groups of people, and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. (end of charicature)  There are other arguments, obviously, and the statement "we can draw a parallel with other situations" is most of the content of the book, which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence. But the real question here is, is the view worthwhile? My answer: No. Social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor. Yes, some social interaction is like a performance, where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another. Yes, some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs. However, most social interaction is exactly the way we see it, conciously controlled, meaningful, purposeful interaction with individuals; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a "reality".  I hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out: the book is a waste of time. Where the author is right, the statement is little more than common sense. Where the author goes outside of common sense, he's wrong, sometimes plainly so. This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes, that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control (here the wool is the performance, and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions). There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims. Where "evidence" is given, the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter. Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth. Various sources of sociology are cited, but this is more like intellectual bullying. Saying that some author, which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims, agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims. The claims in the book have no practical application in the world, but only serve to intepret situations differently, and in personal opinion, less correctly. Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology. In short, this isnt a scientific study at all.   My final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph, the use of language. The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction "A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants" (15). This is a curios definition. Me breathing while i work is a performance, it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers. Me staring into space is a performance, other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced. Infact, me simply existing is a performance, since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants, as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing. Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person, and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance. He didnt. He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior (performance) and defined it in a way no one is used to. Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance, its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality. I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally.  So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt. Why wont this subject go away? This book is an integral part of sociology, and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition. The methods are questionable; the style is obscure. Like it or hate it, sociology is a part of modern thought. Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings 
 Anyone who has read Stephen Ambrose knows that precise historical accuracy is not the main focus of his writing. To the contrary, his aims seem to lie closer to promoting super-human efforts and painting people as heroes regardless of the body of evidence before him. This book is no different, with the subject matter not nearly as interesting as some of his other works such as Crazy Horse & Custer, or Undaunted Courage. In fact, Nothing Like It stands at the bottom of the list of Ambrose books that I have read, and possibly marks the end of the Ambrose literary experiment for me.  The issue isn't that he doesn't write interesting books. He sometimes does, though in this specific case it's highly questionable. The problem is that he doesn't engage in the accurate retelling of history. Now I'll be the first to admit that history is often times subjective. But there needs to be some sort of balance. Given the Union Pacific's duo of Durant and Dodge were highly corrupt and never paid their workers, it's hard to constantly laud these 2 men as heroes, as Ambrose often does. It would be more accurate if these men were painted as 2 of the first big time corporate crooks in America. The evidence is in the book, if you pay attention to it. To that end, I'll give Ambrose credit for at least divulging these facts, even if he does absurdly gloss over it by saying, "Boys will be boys."  Nothing Like It In the World tells of the fantastic struggle to bridge the country with an iron road, a feat that in itself is hard enough to conceive. Throw in the fact that this occurred in a time when slavery was ending and the country was divided by the Civil War, and the accomplishment becomes even more impressive. The feats of engineering and the sheer willpower of the Chinese and Irish workers (not to forget the Mormons) is mind boggling. Struggles against the weather of the high Sierras and a race against the competing railroad give us an interesting look at one of the most colossal feats in American engineering history.  But enough with the sensationalism. The men who financed and organized the road were crooks, much as today's Enron executives and Wall Street high rollers are. They were involved for fastidious financial gain, and little else save for having their names recorded in the annals of American history motivated them. In short, they yearned for money and power. Ironically, and perhaps fittingly, many of these men died of relatively ordinary financial means, and only Stanford's name is now recognized by the common man, and only because of the University, not because of the railroad.  The book is mildly entertaining, but too much of it is saturated with Ambrose's gung ho attitude that America is the Greatest Great thing that ever tried to be Greatly Great. Anyone with a tenth of a brain will tire of this early on in the narrative. It's just not good material, to pick up a history book and get hints of comic book hero-worship on the pages. The guy tried hard to be an historical institution unto himself, and a lot of times he missed the mark completely, this book included.  I don't know much about books that rival this work, but I would bet dollars to doughnuts there are dozens of books better suited to tell this story, and most of them will probably leave the "rah rah America" stuff out of it. I suggest looking for one of them 
 If I could give this movie less than 1 star, I would.  The central character, Ryan, played by Jason Scott Lee (by the way, what happened to the Muscles from Brussels?), is a loser. Why? Because HE SAVES ADOLF HITLER'S LIFE!!! And how does he do this? By killing the leading lady.  Gee, great script guys.  Also, the thing makes no sense. People are obliterated from history, and Ryan knows about it! Hello, if they were removed from history, he would have no memory of them. Duh!  If there was such a thing as a 'Time Cop', they would outlaw people wasting 2hrs watching this ridiculous movie!  
 I give the spanish version a 5 star rating but this english version a 1 star.  At least she gave us some warning in the preface and introduction but personally; when John writes "El diablo" I see no reason to impose your own beliefs into a translation and make "The devil" = "the fragmented self".    I feel I might re-translate all of "Les Miserables" and make it say what I think it should say in english! How about that!  Translate, let us think for ourselves 
 This video is all hype and delivers nothing.  I love dancing.  Dancing in this video is horrible.  For the latin section, there was hardly anything LATIN about it!  It was like she took some aerobics moves and added latin words to them.  Ick!  Not too mention it's hip hop music in the background with a small segment of horns added.  I love Latin dancing and didn't enjoy this at all.  The other dancing sections were equally cheesy.  They were soo cheesy I just felt like an idiot doing them.  If you are not at a stage in life where you still go to clubs/go out, i.e. 40+) then you MIGHT enjoy this.  If you do currently go out dancing it's just going to be torture.   As for the workout, very low-intensity and lots of lulls as another reviewer said.  Definitely not for anyone who enjoys real dancing (because this is horrible) or an advanced exerciser because the workout does not keep your heart rate up.  I wouldn't even recommend this for a beginner because the choreography and direction are way too clumsy.  I think that would make a novice exerciser feel awkward when really it is the video and instructor that are the problem!  Don't waste your money....  there are lots of better vids out there.  This is awful 
 This book is full of errors, and it made me wonder where in the world this  author got so many misconceptions about C. Evidently, he either has not  read the book by Kernighan and Ritchie (the originators of C), or has not  understood it, yet. If you want to become a serious programmer in C,  consult the 2000 reviews at ACCU (Association for C and C++ Users) Internet  site. If you just want to impress your friend at your first date, make sure  your date does not know C better than this author, because this book is  just as bad as so many C/C++ books in the market 
 If the book were entitled "The Natural Superiority of Men" or "The Natural Superiority of Whites" or virtually any other group of people, the book would be called bigoted.  No amount of research  presented in the book would hold back the negative comments and criticisms.   It that regard, it's unfortunate that people praise this book.  It shows  that bigotry is still alive and well in the world, if you target the right  group: men.  Mr. Montagu's book is a case of supporting a preconceived idea  (the superiority of women) with selected research and biased  interpretations.  I know a great deal of people.  I find that women are not  any more or any less compassionate, loving, intelligent, unselfish or  anything else, then men.  It's unfortunate that a distinguished researcher  like Dr. Montagu published such an unscientific book.  It's even more  unfortunate that people will use this book, even subtly, to drive a wedge  between male and female relations.  After all, people are individuals and  must be treated as individuals on a daily basis.  For antidote to "The  Natural Superiority of Women" and how to build trust in male/female  relations read Warren Farrell's "Women Can't Hear What Men Don't  Say" 
 The introduction starts out with a defense of anthropomorphization as an important tool in scientific study, arguing that it gives us terms in which to define what is being seen.  Then she seems to descend into lunatic delusions that she can speak to the animals and read specific motives and feelings out of each dogs ear cock and eye roll without any apparent research aside from her personal examinations.   Her pregnant female dog is stressed so Thomas tries to soothe her telling her it is alright, but the dog "doesn't believe" her-- alternative interpretation, she reinforces the dog's anxiety by rewarding her, and the dog stays anxious.  Duh.  You listen to her describe what she sees, and then she launches into kookoo interpretations and ponder how she reached that conclusion.    One of the other reviewers gave higher marks because he viewed the book as a fascinating look into the pathology of Ms. Thomas as a nutcase.  I wish I had looked at it that way.  I spent way too much time venting at her stupidity.  I'm not quite as intensely offended about the responsibility implications of Ms. Thomas' book as other reviewers-- maybe I am not thinking globally enough.  Of course, I certainly wouldn't leave my dog with her. 
 And I thought I WAS a die-hard Conrad fan!  He's one of those writers by whom I must read a book every two or three years -- but this one I did not like at all.  Despite the usual brilliant prose, much of it as good as  anything Conrad has done, "Tether" is a let-down -- astoundingly  depressing!  Most Conrad work posits a world that is inimical and uncaring,  yet holds out hope that courage and integrity will serve to help us endure  it all; "Tether" holds out no such hope.  It concerns a captain  who continues to pilot his ship even though he is legally blind, doing so  in order to provide for his family.  Nothing turns out okay, and no one  ends up happy.  I don't ask for a lot of hope from the books I read -- but  at least a little 
 If you are still mired in the 1960's, wear a tie-dyed bandana over your balding pate and spout Dan Rather as your authenticating news source, this book is for you.  Full of dated clichés about the earth dieing a slow, tortuous polluted death in the advanced future of 1998, this thriller (yawn) is full of it in every aspect imaginable. Picture a world totally without fossil fuels in the 90's when all of the oil wells dried up and blew away just like liberal scientists predicted in the 60's. Since there is no power from fossil fuels, electricity is supplied for just 2-hours a day - rotating between social classes (just to be fair). Imagine a time when the only relief imaginable for mankind's suffering and slow death is to send a message to the past (the 60's of course) and tell them to give up their cars so that they can switch to ever-reliable horses and bicycles.   By the way, where is the future they predicted anyway. I don't see the disasters here in 2005 that were predicted for the turn of the century. We still have lots of cheap (though over-taxed) oil. International trade is at its highest rate in history. Peace and democracy is breaking out everywhere (even in 14th century mired Middle-East). The only thing I don't see that should have happened is the oft predicted flying car. (But then, that is my own private gripe.)   This poorly worded claptrap is not only intellectually insulting, it is also extremely boring. Going on for pages and pages describing how desiccated the soil has become and how hard life is in the once moist world of a London suburb, is a chore to read even for one, such as myself, who was sentenced to read uncountable n-versions of this stuff innumerably and inexorably in college.   If you really want to be tortured and insulted, read this book. Or, you could sport for some very nice third century thumb-screws.  
 I would have thought that someone with the credentials of Mr. Yates would have done better. Instead, he serves up a book that is full of errors that should have been corrected with entry-level research. When something as basic as the correct year for the 50th anniversary of Sturgis is mis-stated, the complete lack of any interest in factual information is evident. I would dare say that Mr. Yates would never tolerate repeated mis-statements of fact without researching the subject in his magazine. He should be ashamed of this. Unfortunately, what he have is just another author whipping up a book without regard to content in the sole search for profit. Please don't waste your money as I did 
 In the quest to reduce waste, you would do well to eliminate this book from your reading list.  If you are looking for a guide to visual management (tools, techniques), this book comes up (way) short.  Although the author acknowledges that visual management is part of a lean workplace, it is obvious she has little knowledge or experience with either.  Her utter lack of understanding of accepted terminology, redefining of basic definitions, bad examples, and other glaring errors make this book a 'must miss'.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one (put the money in your retirement fund! 
 They sent me a product that wasn't legit and wouldn't take it back. Horrible service & I don't recommend anyone buy from this particular vendor! Just a horrible waste of time & MONEY 
 Of the 16 essays presented in this collection, only three were worth my time:  (1) Orson Scott Card's Introduction is a very informative and thoughtful analysis showing how TV has evolved over the last half-century and how LOST may be the next "evolutionary" step.  (2) Amy Brenner's "Double Locked" illustrates how the fictional character John Locke closely echoes the teachings of the real-life 16th century philosopher with the same name.  (3) Glenn Yeffeth's "The Art of Leadership" is the highlight of the collection, which discusses how Jack, Locke, and Sawyer are all really bad leaders. And it puts forth a pretty good argument that Hurley may be the best leader on the island.  Some of other 13 essays fall into the category of Comedy.  "The Same Damn Island" points out the show's similarities with Gilligan's Island.  "LOST Connections" attempts to concoct a conspiracy theory based on which actors have appeared on film together throughout their careers.  "The LOST Book Club" and "Have You Been Framed?" examine literary allusions and shared themes with classic works.  "LOST in Love" tries to analyze every love pairing on the show.  Surprisingly, only the essay "Game Theory" actually attempted to explain the mysteries; but I really hope the show doesn't turn out to be just one giant video game.  "Oops" and the Encyclopedia are both out of date, due to events that been aired since the publication of the book.  Overall, I guess I wanted more of these authors to present their theories to explain the mysteries.  Instead, I felt most of these pieces were just fluff and "talking head" analysis 
 If you know nothing about performance management this is your book. Simple, large letters, wide spacing and easy to read. A lot of general information together.  But if you are somewhat equiped in the field: don't buy this book. Not worth the trouble of buying. 
 Is this book reviewed before it's published? It contains too many errors, some of which are fundamental. Is it practical, if the design equations are only presented, not explained? Anyway, you can  get some ideas for your switching power designs after reading this book. 
 What a disappointment!  The device just wasn't predictable.  Sometimes it would do as expected, sometimes not.  It was just a crapshoot.  Finally unplugged it and it's in a drawer somewhere.  Yes, I played with the sensitivity with no success.  Getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince The Clapper to do its thing.  Save your money and look elsewhere 
 I was disappointed in this product.  When I attached it at the cable source it created probles for my broadband connection and living TV set.  I did install it at my TV on the second floor where I was originally having signal deterioration and it worked for awhile.  I would first suggest having your cable company in and "tweak" your cable throughput - it shouldn't cost you anything other than sitting around waiting for a service call.  I no longer have it installed and will resell it on ebay 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 This book is just about the worst thing I have ever read.  One thing though... it talks about the end of the prairie home companion show... was there some break there or what?  the show is on every weekend.  Purple Monkey Dishwasher 
 Stokes' favourite son belts out another hit album. Sadly there is nothing original here, just another mish-mash of pop tunes that could have been done by any X Factor wannabee.  In fact it may be fair to say that Mr Williams has done very little since 'Let Me Entertain You' and perhaps now might be the time to call it a day, especially as he's struggling to get anyone in the U.S. to notice him! He obviously has talent but why he insists on releasing formulaic albums such as this one is beyond me.  I've given this two stars simply for the fact the cd makes a useful coaster for my coffee mug 
 I recently bought this "Literary Classics" edition of "The  Diaries of Adam & Eve" expecting it to be the text of the  wonderful audiobook version of Twain's stories, as read by Betty Buckley  and Mandy Patinkin, only to find that it is not the same at all.  This  version is just a replica of the original books and does not include the  full text as heard on the audiobook.  Then I found the version I wanted,  subtitled "Translated by Mark Twain" and it, like the audiobook  version, is really something special.  To anyone interested in these  wonderful "first family" stories, I recommend searching for the  Fair Oaks Press edition 
 I used to love all the different books written by this author, whether she was writing as Amanda Quick, Jayne Anne Krentz or Jayne Castle.  Now they are all so dull - almost over-detailed.  This book is no different.  While the premis of "para-psychology" could have been interesting the language developed by the author to describe the different types of psychics is confusing and over-used.  I found myself skipping huge chunks of this book just to get to the point of the conversation.  Don't waste your money -borrow it if you are a die hard fan or wait for it at the local library.  I only gave it one star because her heros are usually the strong, silent type - a personal favorite of mine 
 Very hard to read book with poor examples. I ended up returning the book 
 The Book is just a info commercial at best, almost no tech help 
 As much as I like Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, I really wanted to like this film.  I enjoyed them in Kiss The Girls, and I expected another interesting film.  Their performances were the only bright spot, but they couldn't rescue this movie.  This film was so unbelievable and disjointed it made me want to scream.  There was absolutely nothing in this film that was plausible.  As many other reviewers noted (I only wish I had read the reviews before I wasted 2 hours with this celluloid pile of feces), it was so very predictable.    I rented 2 films yesterday, and I had trouble watching both of them, for very different reasons.  The other film was "Monster", starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.  I almost couldn't watch that film because it was so realistic and it just sucked me into the story and I forgot that it was a movie.  It absolutely is a gripping story, and Ms. Theron richly deserved the Best Actress Oscar that she received for it.  Conversely, I almost couldn't watch High Crimes because it was so ridiculous.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  
 Brad Gooch is certainly a skillful writer.  He researched his subjects meticulously.  However, the title and blurbs on the dustjacket of his book are totally misleading.  The book is more about a few spiritual outposts in America than it is about the spectrum of spirituality across the country.  There are only five chapters:  one about an arcane revelatory path called the Urantia Movement, the second about the life and times of Deepak Chopra (mostly in other countries), the third about Trappist monks, the fourth a collection of miscellany about the Cathedral of Hope, Soulforce, and Jerry Falwell (mostly in Texas and California), and the fifth about Islam in New York.    A blurb on the back of the dustjacket says, "It's hard to imagine a more important subject than religion in America, or a more compassionate, accessible guide than Brad Gooch.  Godtalk is a necessary book."  Another says, "In this period of self-searching, Brad Gooch guides us through spiritual America with intelligence, wit, and sensitivity."  I gave Gooch's book only two stars because I feel swindled 
 If you are new to linear algebra, (even if you took introductory course), don't buy this.  All those who took Linear Algebra course using this book got to hate the subject.  Cheap for the content?  Yes, of course.  Because the content is not good.  Not constructed well.  I'm relearning it using Schaum's Outline, which is good and now I understand what was written in this awful book 
 "Business the Amazon.com Way" (first edition) was published in 1999, at the height of dot-com mania, when Amazon had 1,000 employees and was trading at $209 a share. So it's hopelessly dated. The book might still have merit if it included a good history of Amazon's early years, but the information on Amazon's foundation and early growth is sketchy. This book was aimed at aspiring internet entrepreneurs, touting the endless possibilities for business on the web and presenting Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as a shining example of e-commerce success. "Business the Amazon.com Way" is a simplistic handbook for web businesses more than a study of Amazon, and it looks even more naïve in retrospect, considering the dot-com crash.  Author Rebecca Saunders catalogs the reasons for Amazon's success that could be applied to your internet start-up: know your customers, update pages frequently, link from related sites, have clear long-term goals, brand the site, be customer-centric, staffing and recruiting, a distribution plan for fast order fulfillment and delivery, frugality, state-of-the-art technology, constant innovation, continual growth. And we get a general idea of how Jeff Bezos and the early Amazonians went about accomplishing these things. But it's pretty simple stuff. I don't think "Business the Amazon.com Way" did anything more than state the obvious, in limited detail, in 1999. If you're looking for a primer on Amazon's early years, Robert Spector's "Amazon.com: Get Big Fast" (2000) is equally enthusiastic and uncritical, but it is much more useful. 
 It's a typical Robin Cook book with lot of biotechnology jargon. Its' about this scientist who mutates the zygote of his own kid for some experiment. What he ends up with is a child with a abnormally high IQ and absolutely zero emotions. His child turns out into a lonely, unemotional kid, totally detached from this world. This book is about this exceptional, abnormal child and his effect on the people around him.  The story is gripping, though predictable. It's a page turner - one can finish the book in a day. The writing is nothing remarkable. The only factor than can keep the reader interested in the book is the story. The characters are pretty well developed, though there a few loopholes.   If you are looking for a quick, science thriller, then pick up this book. If you have had enough of science jargons, then move on to the next shelf 
 I purchaced this magazine thinking that it would be the next step from the amateur photo magazine level to the serious pro level.  In fact, it is not really either.  
 My girlfriend has this CD. I never even heard of these dudes. But somethimes when my girlfriend is driving she has this CD on in her car and just something about the way she drives and she's sunk way down in her seat with the rearview mirror slanted all the way down, and something about the way she mouths the words but doesn't actually sing out loud, and something about the way her hair is always too long in her face and the way her car always smells like pink roses. Its just really cool. Otherwise I would never in a million years listen to this stuff. 
 Yep, this cd sucks. That Depeche Mode guy is really random, what makes you think anyone who is looking at the punk-o-rama review would be interested in Depeche Mode? REM sucks too, Michael Stipe is the most self absorbed old bald guy ever. 
 Normally I love James books but this one let me down. Dalgliesh plays a very small part in it amounting to almost nothing. Instead the investigation was headed by an Insp. Rickards and I didnt gel with him at all. There were too many different people to deal with that it became confusing. I agree, if you want to know a little bit about nuclear power, then this is a great reference on it 
 What in tarnation is this?  And who listens to this?  Are you like rolling down the street with your windows down.  Yo check it.  Sufjan...kicking it out.  Heck no.  I would be embarrased to have anyone see me and hear these sounds.  It's like...I don't even know...like a bad production of Jesus Christ Super Star.  ? I can't even beleive it.  I feel like an idiot listneing to this garbage.  Who rocks it like this.?  Where do they find these people. And there are like mad people dying in Africa and stuff...what would they think of you if they saw you listening to this...They would know that they are really going to die.  Oh no.  Look at those crazy Americans.  We are dead for sure now.  No way they are gonna help us, when they can't even help themselves. People. Please.  
 I think if you have used PowerPoint for a month, you'll figure out most of the stuff in this book. That's for those who want the content. If you want a funny read, then get this book 
  The People of Sparks by Jeanne DuPrau is a horrible book that I would not recommend to people under the age of eleven. This story takes place in the city of Sparks. Lina & Doon have just lead the people of Ember out from underground. After coming to the city the Emberites are mistreated, malnourished, and misunderstood. So Lina goes out into the Empty Lands with a roamer that is looking for treasure. The Empty Lands are full of owls, coyotes, and other odd animals. There are also destroyed homes and buildings. Following this she comes back, and there is a large fight involving everybody. After that the climax is still climbing, and the most important part is ... I can't tell you!  	The above ground city of Sparks is an incredibly small city. The population is only three hundred twenty-seven and then to make matters worse, four hundred odd some people of Ember come to live with them. With food being scarce and people on the brink of war, Lina leaves with a roamer and goes to the Ancient City. This roamer that Lina left with is very rude, odd, and is looking for buried treasure that isn't there. When the roamer leaves, Lina leaves with the roamer's partner and head back to Sparks. When the two meet a new roamer, that is going to Sparks, they travel with him. The Roamer tells Lina the clues to the treasure, and Lina tells him that it is... I can't tell you, you have to read it.  	Truly, I thought the book was horrible, and weird because I don't like Fantasies, but if you like Fantasies you should read it 
 The Mini Fondue Kit is a really great idea.  My girlfriend is a fondue lover, and I thought this would be perfect for her.  Unfortunately, the idea was better than the execution.  The first problem is that the assembly instructions for the metal stand did not match the actual stand (at least no with the one we got.)  The stand we got had three legs, not four as shown in the instructions, and it did not seem possible to bend the legs as described.  We think we got it right in the end, but the instructions should be clear.  (Note that the three-legged stand is probably better than the four-legged one because a three-legged stand is more stable, so maybe we got a new stand but an old set of instructions?)  A much bigger problem was that the dish was too small for some of the recipes.  My girlfriend tried to make one of the chocolate fondues and the ingredients ended up completely filling the dish to the point it was not possible to mix them without spilling.  Then, when she heated it in the microwave it bubbled over.  Had it not spilled then, it would have spilled when she dipped something in it.  It is too bad because it was a good idea.  I am going to get her a replacement.  I have been looking at:  Chantal Butter Warmers (ASIN B00004RKFE), Trudeau Basic 7-Piece Chocolate Fondue Set (ASIN B00029I3Q2), and the Chocolatiere Electric Chocolate Melting Pot (ASIN B00074HGJ2).  The butter warmers look close to what I think this item should be:  4 oz. makes them large enough for the recipes with the Mini Fondue Kit with enough room to spare for stirring and dipping.  The other two items are a bit fancier, but may be better choices.  I will write an update when I have gotten one 
 I grew up listening to her "In Concert" album, and bought the Pearl album based on reviews saying this was a more mature style for her music.  I like her old style better, this sounds like she was trying to make a more pop sound for her music (although the singing wasn't much different).  It not only didn't sound like what you expect from Janice Joplin, it sounded like a muzak imitation of her 
 This is a short novel and a very fast read due primarily to the quick and witty dialogue between girlfriends, which is the best part of the writing. I truly felt like I was listening in on backyard or kitchen table conversations in a white, suburban neighborhood.  It reeks of autobiography and the author makes no secret of this in the end, even though she continually speaks through "fictional" characters. Unfortunately, the narrator, Pril, comes off as judgmental in spite of obvious efforts not to be. She was a little too good-or moral-or even holier than thou and I felt sorry for her husband, who was left out of her affections as she concentrated on the terribly unfaithful friend, Ruth. But when one of her characters points out that oft heard anecdote regarding what you don't like about a person actually points to something you don't like about yourself, it came too close to home and I knew she was right. So ultimately, I related. But I found Pril was too easy on Ruth, who pulls an unforgivable stunt, and was disappointed with the story overall. It won't make my favorites list, unlike most of the movies the two main characters decide are the best stories about separation.  Two and a half stars 
 Sadly, this is just a waste of your money. I can't think of anything nice to say about it. It's sad that a man who has recorded several albums of his own plus numerous hit singles  finds the need to sing songs which his brother, Barry, made famous. I was deeply upset to see that he even recorded Barry's signature song "Words".   Robin has a voice of his own and should try to sing songs fitted for his voice. He needs to step back and realize that one person does not make a Bee Gees. It required all three of them to create the magic.   
 Try "Sam and the Lucky Money" for a good story and an accurate portrayal of life in SF Chinatown 
 Do not purchase this ebook!  You can't print it.  AND it uses some sort .NET internet validation that stopped working on the laptop I downloaded it on.  So, I CAN'T print it and I CAN'T read it.  For GOD'S SAKE SOMEBODY TELL ME  - WHAT GOOD IS THIS LOAD OF E-BOOK!  Unreal.  Absolutely unreal 
 The first CD-TV152 that I received produced no sound with TV.  It was returned. The replacement produces no sound within seconds of starting the CD player. I cannot keep carrying these to UPS for return, and will need to buy some other CD player 
 AN AIR FORCE PILOT [ICE-T] FAKES HIS OWN DEATH ONLY TO RESURFACE AS THE PARTNER OF A DEADLY LATIN AMERICAN ARMS DEALER [ANDREW DIVOFF]. WHEN A STEALTH GETS STOLEN AND IT'S USED TO TARGET THE MILITARY, IT'S UP TO ONE MAN [COSTAS MANDYLOR] TO STOP HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. ONE THING THAT CAN'T BE DENIED IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS BORING. THE ACTION IS NOT WORTH WATCHING, THE SCRIPT IS DUMB, AND THE STORY JUST GETS TIRING AFTER A WHILE. ERNIE HUDSON'S ACTING TALENTS ARE ONCE AGAIN WASTED IN ANOTHER LOW-RENT DIRECT-TO-VIDEO FILM. IF YOU LIKE ICE-T AND WANNA SEE ONE OF HIS MORE RECENT FILMS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RENT OR BUY ''OUT KOLD''. 
 Hey here's an idea. What if Hitler was right all along, only it is men, not jews, who are to blame for all the woes of the world. We should build a new Auschwitz and exterminate them all. Right Andrea? In my opinion, this is just as bad as any misogynist. It's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women's liberation movement back for so long 
 It will be easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. Well Patty Boy I hope you have been training one hell of a camel because otherwise you are going to be mighty hot for an eternity. This man is a intolerant bigot. 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 This watch is a good size, pretty comfortable, and nice looking for a sport watch. But resetting time or date, or figuring out how to turn off the alarm when you set it by mistake (when you were trying to figure out how to reset the time and date) is super frustrating. The buttons are impossible. I've had it with mine and will buy another product 
 As I read, I wondered to myself whether or not the authors that contributed to this anthology were serious. This had to be the worst thing I have ever read. If I knew how to give it less than one star,I would. A friend previewed it for me over the phone and I was turned off then. He couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't stop shaking my head. I was mostly annoyed by Zane trying her hand at this. Her erotica isn't that great and here she is branching into new territory? This book was horrible, not horror. It is an insult to the Kings and Queens of Horror to add this book to their genre. Try again folks, and add some thought this time 
 While the book is not bad, the authors will give you the irritating feeling that they have milked this cow for all it is worth. Where does it end? Chicken Soup for the Soup Lover's Soul? Chicken Soup for the Mountain Climbers Soul? Chicken Soup for the Amazon Reviewer's Soul???  Where there is a buck to be made on inspiration, the authors of the "Chicken Soup" series will sniff it out 
 Enough sai 
 Yes! In fact, Vanilli are lip-synchers. THey're the Ashlee Simpsons of 1988. I wasn't born then, but I do kow what their music is like. Why should I worry? BECAUSE THESE GUYS DID NOT SING THE TITLE TRACK, AND THAT IS FINAL. In fact, It's no wonder that they got made fun of! Oh well. Ashlee Simpson does the same. THe next tour is with Ashlee. So enjoy this, you fellow people who like lip-synchers 
 The content of this book is only common sense steps... and targeted for completely disorganized people. For those using their brain before acting, do not buy this book: you won't find any secret, nor precious tips. But if you're a teen and wonder how to start a consulting business in the future: it could be a good investment. I bought the ebook edition, at least I didn't waste paper... Alan Weiss should learn more Japanese, because the word "sogomi" (at page 8!) doesn't exist. This mistake gives you the level of this book 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 In searching for a guide to lesbian wedding planning, my partner-to-be and I encountered this book at the local glbt bookstore. We were both sadly disappointed by the lack of up-to-date information and the antiquated nature of the content. Perhaps due to the time period in which the book was written, many of the women were estranged from their families and seemingly on the fringes of society. We had difficulty identifying with any of them. A more current version is desparately needed 
 i purchased this book, mainly because of my love for michael moore's work and i wanted to see what the other side had to say. however, most of the book simply pointed out flaws in michael moore's character, rather than attack the things he had to say. im sure most of us could assume that michael moore was not the easiest person to get along with. i was upset when reading this book, as i am with most political books, because rather than put up well spoken arguments, the author just bashes anyone who believes otherwise. i am a liberal and was disgusted when reading certain parts of this book, mostly because it consisted of essays trying to debase liberals and not much else. the things they pointed out about michael moore's movies/books that were false were good points, however they were trivial when compared to the larger things that moore had to say. overall, i was not impressed with what this book had to say, i was insulted, and it looks like i wasted a fair amount of money 
 These books are a good idea for the repeat visitor to a city-- basically just a place for notes in the lovely (I think) Moleskine format.  The maps, though, can be found better and cheaper on other places.  MORE IMPORTANT,  this seller has claimed a falsely inflated list price and consequent discount that is misleading.  The list price for these books is 17.95.  Check in any book store.  Shame on the seller 
 I've been told by many people that this show was an American Monty Python.  While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny.  The only sketches I liked were the "burger" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute).  But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced.  The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either.  I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't.  Sorry...  
 I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better. Very poor and grainy.  Also the focus is terrible! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus.  I filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing.  Very disappointed with this purchase.  I guess it's true what they say. "You get what you pay for"  It seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much 
 Hey here's an idea. What if Hitler was right all along, only it is men, not jews, who are to blame for all the woes of the world. We should build a new Auschwitz and exterminate them all.

 I loved the descriptions of the work in the kitchen, but I found the plot to be extremely flimsy. A happenstance meeting with an unscrupulous character later in the book was particularly egregious 
 I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents).  I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)  My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he "met."  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.  The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading.  After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.  So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed.  
 I am surprised that this edition was allowed to be so widely distributed....many forms in the back were overprinted with the annotation "draft, do not use."  This year's version lacked the usual crispness of prior years versions.  If I had known how good TurboTax was this year I would never have purchased Ernst & Young guide 
 At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well. 
 This book is alright, but not very useful. It's pretty much all the same lesson repeated over and over again in different ways. I sub at a school where the students stay in the same room and teachers move. This book requires you to write A LOT on the board. Yes, this involves turning your back on a class for a long time at the beginning of class. This is not a good idea for any sub's "survival." You're better off finding free internet lesson plans in the various subject areas than wasting your money on this book. 
 I thoroughly enjoy a good sci-fi series, whether it's Azimov's Foundation series, McCaffery's Dragonriders of Pern, or Herbert's Dune books.  I'd heard of the Hitchhiker series for years and when I found it in omnibus form, I was delighted and picked it up forthwith.  But for some strange reason, it didn't happen for me.  Only because I'd spent the money did I manage to get thru the lot. But, with apologies to the Grateful Dead, what a long, strange, and gnarly slog it was.  I suppose  it's one of those things like Peter Sellers (YES!,) Pee Wee Herman (caaREEEPY,) or Barney (gagging sounds).  You love it or not.  There's no middle ground 
 Several facts to ponder: 1) Frederick Douglas, upon his trip to Ireland, said that the suffering due to the Potato famine that he experienced was far worse than anything he had seen back in the United States -- look it up if you don't believe me.  Now, many of these desperately poor Irish immigrants came to the United States (including my ancestors) and clawed their own way up through anti-Irish laws, etc.  Now, I am not saying this was equal to being slaves, but there are MANY different groups that have suffered at some time in history -- are we to give them all reparations?  2) Blacks were very involved in the slave trade in Africa.  This was not well known 20 years ago, but is now very well documented.    3) Slavery was practiced all throughout the world, and we suffered terribly in this country (600,000+ dead and hundreds of thousands wounded) during a bloody civil war.  This country paid a very dear price for using slavery.  Read the late writings of Abraham Lincoln to understand how the brutality of the war was a result of the sin of slavery.  4) I live near Washington D.C. and drive a 95 Toyota Corolla, work 2 jobs and have four children.  I see many blacks on the highway flying by me in their BMW's, Mercedes, etc. and in their 3 piece suits.  My next door neighbor is Black and has a Beemer!  Please don't tell me that they need reparations.  Yes, I know there are many poor black neighborhoods -- I have volunteered and worked to help their plight -- but it is not a black thing only of course.  That's all I have to say.  I am sure Randall Robinson is sitting pretty in a house much nicer than mine, by the way...but that's ok...I have a beautiful family :)  
 Unfortunately i was not impressed by this book, i had heard so many great things and bought it based on reviews, and my love of nature - but i have picked this book up three different times and can not get into it, i just find it boring. I am not a nature hater, i have a bird feeder, a bird bath, a dog and a cat as pets, I love animals and can stare at the birds at the feeder for a long time, infact that is much more entertaining to me than this slow moving, boring book.  I will pass it on to a friend, and hopefully they can find the magic in the book that i was unable to appreciate. i just found it to be too dry 
 Again we see an 'Action Encyclopedia' from Bensn, which turns out to be little more than exerpts of Paladin Press books, including quite a few titles from Ragnar re-hashed in what is generally a waste of your time.  More B.S. explosives, including the 'improved C-4' formula. Interesting  reading for those who aren't serious 'men of action.', but a waste of time  for the rest of us 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 This book came highly recommended to me.  With all the hype surrounding its apparent genius I expected to be blown away.  Sadly though, this book comes across as someone who has just played a video game for the first time (MYST) and decided that the kids might be on to something.  Murray proclaims that one day in the distant future, they'll make a 'holodeck' and we'll finally have true immersion.  In the mean time, we can gloss over all the interactive components that make such an experience compelling in the first place.  The future of gaming/narratology/ludology whatever-you-want-to-call-it is already here.  You don't need a "VR Suit" or some imaginary technology to have a truly immersive experience.  Her woefully uninformed look at the games of her day are completely inexcusable:  "...interactors will be lured into worlds where they float, tumble, and arc through thrillingly coloured spaces, fly through imaginary clouds and swim lazily across welcoming mountain ponds.  The nightmare landscape of the fighting maze, in which we feel imperiled may give way to enchanting worlds of increasingly refined visual dealight that are populated by evocative fairy-tale creatures."  At the time of this book's publishing (1997) games such as Jumping Flash, Mario 64, and Tomb Raider had already taken the world by storm. By reducing contemporary gaming to mindless, juvenile violence (while championing those themes in 'War & Peace', 'Hamlet' and 'Star Trek') Murray shows a complete lack of interest and imagination.    The heavy hand of narrative is not the only way to tell a story.  We don't need a "cyberdramatist" the likes of a Dickens or a Shakespeare to show us the way.  She could have explored the work of Miyamoto, Wright or Kojima and the stories that arise out those gaming experiences.  Instead she focuses on the Miller Brothers because they offered up the most conventional form of storytelling.  Eight years on, their impact is almost forgotten.  Above all, people want to act - not in the theatrical sense, but in the name of imaginative 'play'.  Maybe someday she'll prove us all wrong and the "Dr. Quinn Holodeck" will sweep us up in the rapturous joy of existing in a town populated by:   "...blacksmiths, barbers, general store owners, saloon keepers, scouts, and, of course, female doctors and who could be given their own homesteads or boardinghouse rooms in particular physical locations within the fictional world."    Sounds like fun.  Criticism aside, I did enjoy the chapter "Eliza's Daughters".  Murray's look at procedural characters and believable agents proved informative and intriguing.  If only the rest of the book were as objective and plausible then I might actually believe the hype surrounding, "Hamlet on the Holodeck".  
 A MOUSE LOOSES HIS FAMILY MEMBERS & THEN FINDS THEM.  IT'S JUST AN OK BOOK, VERY UNDERSERVING OF ALL THE 5-STAR REVIEWS.  A BETTER MOUSE BOOK WOULD BE- IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE. 
 To say that this is a work on the historical Jesus is simply a fallacy.  Instead of adressing Jesus within his social context, through using the tools of archeology and the many textual sources available, Crossan abstracts the sayings of Jesus and then imposes modern sociological theory back onto Jesus.  It's one thing to do a sociological analysis of first century Palestine, it's quite another to use general (western modernist) sociological theory and then fit Jesus into it.  Crossan's sources can hardly be seen as credible in his "reconstruction" of Jesus' social context. (Precisely because such a recontruction is lacking.  Instead, we end up with more abstraction and psycho-analysis, though a weak one). The cynic theory is long ago dead to legitimate sholarship (see Arnal, Reed and Horsley among others) because it simply does not deal with Jesus' context.  Galilee was not a thriving pagan anything.  There is no archeological support for large numbers of pagans.  This book is so utterly immaterial that to put it in the historical Jesus category is deceptive.  Perhaps this is why Crossan's newer work is done with Reed, an archeologist and excellent scholar, who in his own work is critical of Crossan's thesis.  I have recently started "Excavating Jesus" by these two and have much higher hopes for it b/c it is material and as material, in the first few pages alone it contradicts some of Crossan's points.  For example, Crossan claims in this book that crucified people were simply left to the wild animals after possibly being thrown into shallow graves. So, therefore, the early Jesus followers (who lived in a way very similar to sociolism, but were even more radical though non-violent) made the whole thing up.  He's right of course to say that it was common to leave the bodies for wild animals, but he ignores the possibility of particularity since Jesus had Joseph of Arimethea,a prominant Pharisee, requesting the body. (He also assumes this is made up, though he lacks a decent reason for thinking so, other than that it doesn't agree with his presuppositions.)  Through archeological discoveries, we now have a crucified man in a tomb.  There were exceptions and this demonstrates that point.  "Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography" is simply sloppy scholarship.  Read Wright, Horsley, Moxnes, Sanders, Reed, Arnal, and Oakman for a more accurate picture of the "historical" Jesus. For more theological examinations of his work in terms of its social aspects see Yoder's "The Politics of Jesus." Ched Myers has an excellent poltical reading of Mark called "Binding the Strong Man. 
 Save your money and buy Netzer's Encyclopedia of Food Values:  this book appears to be merely an extract from the larger work. You will receive four or five times as much information, although you still won't have dietary fiber information. 	The problem with Netzer's Carbohydrate  Counter is that it neglects to break the carbohydrate gram count into its  nutritional carbohydrate and dietary fiber carbohydrate components. That  makes this book useless for those people whose nutritional needs require  that information. 	This book simply gives total carbohydrate counts and  says "Th-th-th-that's all, folks.&quot 
 I guess this dvd is okay for learning some basic movements, but her technique is off.  
 I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.  
 "Time and Again" was probably Finney's masterpiece, and the idea of a sequel is interesting.  However, this sequel is based upon a rather weak premise to begin, and it never really gets off the ground.  The problem with any sequel is that it is automatically subject to comparison with the original, and "Time After Time" just does not live up to its predecessor.    
 I had to read this book in high school and this book is a sure way to turn off students from so-called literature.  It's just page after page of agonizing self-analysis and reflection.  The more I read, the less I cared, and the more I cheered for Hagar to end the flow of pretentious garbage by killing herself, thus putting both of us out of our misery 
 I agree with the previous reviewer who wrote of the guilt trip that this book gives to working mothers.  I am an Australian who is residing in the USA, and I am shocked and appalled at the American attitude towards working mothers.  In Australia it is the norm for women to pursue careers and work in fulltime jobs, whether they are single, married, de facto, mothers, young, old, whatever.  Childcare is a policy issue for government, is often subsidised, and considered imperative for the growth of the economy and the wellbeing of the community.  What assistance does the American government give to working mothers?!  How does the American media portray mothers of Generation X?!  The attitude here is so far behind it is laughable.  For American authors to claim authority over subjects such as Generation X and its place on the world stage, they will need to update their ideas and look to other societies as well as their own.  
 I am a male incest survivor, and I got this book because the Courage to Heal For Women was very helpful to me; there aren't that many books for male survivors.  This author has some good things to offer; it's unfortunate that the book gets clouded by her prejudice.  [...] Myself and many people I know from recovery (including women) were sexually abused by their mothers or other women without any man being involved.  She also insinuates that boys don't often get sexually abused.  Wrong.  Sexual abuse against boys is much less reported.  I support anyone writing a book for female survivors, but there is no need to take shots at boys who have been sexually abused, and it's shameless to not hold female perpetrators accountable for what they have done. Any adult, male or female is responsible for their own actions 
 Dull, dull, dull. If I could have submitted a review and given ZERO stars I would have. Pointless 
 I want this guy to succeed so badly, yet he just couldn't pull it off.   His voice has a great sound to it, pleasant to the ears, yet his interpretation was just not there. His  phrasing was very lazy and boring most times. It seemed like he didn't know where to start the next word. And he also sounded out of breath. He sounded so out of breath that I started gasping for air...I had to stop listening.  To add to that, John's vibrato sounded washed out and faded in places where it needed to be stronger.  I truly hope with age and experience he improves. There's no reason why he should not. He's not in the catagory of a Buble' or Connick Jr. yet. 
 I bought this as a last minute addition to my cart.  I was disappointed as Shannon really could of told her story in a much more intereasting way.  It seemed to me the book was more an introspective of her life and a self analysis, which was very boring for me to read 
 I should have passed on this one. It cowtows to the authorities so that its most important message seems to be that it was invented to make money. Nothing new or revealing here that David Lipsky's "Absolutely American" doesn't have 
 As a little league coach I had hoped there might be something I could use. There's a good page on the pitcher's fielding obligations, and some good photos. Beyond that though a big part of the book is devoted to telling the  reader what the Braves' pitchers do between starts. All in all, though,  there isn't much here. Tom House's book, for example, is far more useful 
 Ok...received this item last night...used once, and in the process realized I was pointing a laser beam on my skull.  Given the directions say 3 times a week, 15 minutes per, I would have to do this for a long time with no proven results...Save yourself the time...do this...Go to google and type in "Forum and HairPro".  You will find next to nothing regarding information for this product.  I made an impulse purchase getting sucked in to the exploitation...after further research even the top rated hairmaxx brush selling for $500 has mixed results on the online forums.  Not to mention that Viatek had spelling errors in the pamphlet that came with the product...If they don't have the time to make sure all is spelled right in the manual, how much time did they spend creating the actual product.  The box had a date of 2005 and there was dust all over it.  These lasers may work, but with all the research I did (after the purchase) results seem minimal for all the work that needs to be done.  I felt ridiculous using the thing too.  I am just annoyed because again I got sucked into a new gimmick for something that companies can exploit in individuals.  
 I'm currently working through these books with my children, one of whome is in Kindergarten.  They made me long for the days of the "Tip and Mitten" and "Dick and Jane" readers.  The drawings are of poor quality.  I could draw better myself.  And, more frusterating to me, there is no attempt at any kind of story.  What there is consists of random sentence fragments concentrated around certain phonetics.  The sentence fragments get longer as one progresses through the book.   What does work in these books is the progression of usage of words from very simple to slightly more complex by the end of the book, and the series concept allows the child to slowly build competence in reading as s/he works through the books.    So, they're not all bad and I am working with them, but do yourself a favor and unless your local school system has you roped into using them at home in conjunction with the child's schooling, look around and see what your other options are.  
 A better description than the title provides would be "200 Tips for  growing flowers (particularly in the Pacific Northwest)" -- the vast  majority of these tips are generic flower growing ideas and have no special  bearing on this region. The sections on weather and garden health are the  only ones that really benefit from a Pacific NW focus. If you are looking  for a regional flower-gardening guide this is not it. If you want a list of  flower growing hints and ideas, and happen to live in the Northwest, this  book might have some value to you, especially if you are looking for a few  pointers on planning and design, with suggested plant combinations  apparantly suitable for this region 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 I bought this book soon after the death of my 11 year old daughter. I found the approach very uncomfortable and it left me feeling as though i was failing because i was not following the prescribed way of grieving. The examples given in the book led me to belive that if i did not follow the advice of the author i would be doomed to a life of sadness and despair. The most damaging aspect of the text was the insistance in "letting go", and idea i still find very difficult to accept. The freightening examples of people who had become overly interseted in the cause of a loved one's death only to fall victim to the sane illness would have been better placed in horror fiction. Stear clear, this book will help know one except the author 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 Since the end of the Cold War, writers and political commentators have suggested that we have entered a new war - a war brought on by the "clash of civilizations". The theory, as told by writers such as Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis, amongst others, suggests that "the west" is at war with Islam and that this global divide will replace the earlier Cold War acrimony. Not for any particular reason or circumstance is this war being waged against us, they suggest, but merely because of its violent nature and hatred of western civilization. It is the very essence of Islam, a religion that does not share core values with ours which is the problem, and the only way to contain its violence is to be merciless in our efforts to do so.     Aside from this rhetoric being advocated as "fact" by news organizations such as FOX cable news, CNN, and most newspapers, this thesis has been regularly used by the powerful to justify wars. The U.S. used it to justify the war with Iraq and Afghanistan; Serbs and Croatians used it to justify ethnic cleansing of Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims; and it is used by Israel to justify their "war" with Palestinians.    The Clash of Civilization rhetoric suggests that the world will always be at war. As opposed to the Cold War with the Soviet Union (a country only in existence for less than a century), Islam is an old religion spread  throughout the world. The framework of the Cold war between the Communist "east" and the capitalist "west" did prove useful in making this theory. The new war is between the rational, democratic, secular, and tolerant "west" and the irrational, fundamentalist, and violent "east". Orwell could have predicted this well: the new enemy created on the morning after the old enemies fell. It almost seems that for the "west"  to feel at home with itself, it needs to be at constant war with some "other". Perhaps it provides some guidance to what we are and what we are not - we are simply not the "other". Perhaps Chomsky and others who have suggested that a major reason that states fight wars is for domestic reasons and for the disciplining of a nation's own population are right.     Not according to the "clash theorists" like Bernard Lewis, who claim that the clash will continue as long as Islam exists. He believes that the radical Islamic militants are not deviants from Islam, but actually have a more correct view of it. They will therefore likely become more influential over the years. But if such a clash really existed, why then do western nations continue to support both financially and militarily such Islamic groups and nations? As Eqbal Amad noted, the U.S. has long supported this very enemy, be it with Iraq (during and after the Iraq-Iran wars), the Saudi Monarchy, or the Afghani Mujahadeen.     Perhaps this theory falls within the entire framework of colonialism. Western colonial nations conquered the world and forced its non-western inhabitants to submit to their authority. It was believed and advocated that colonialism would help these "backward" people in the long run to become just like the colonists. Beyond the arrogance of the idea, colonialism developed sophisticated systems of slavery and servitude that sought to extract valuable natural resources from these areas for the sole benefit of their the colonizers own nations.     Interestingly anti-western Islamic militants use the same kind of "absolute conflict" to frame their war with the West. They say the conflict is between the hedonistic, degenerate, repressive, soulless West and the just, truthful, and moral center of Islam. Speaking to this subject, writers Qureshi and Sells note:     "Those who proclaim such a clash of civilizations, speaking for the West or for Islam, exhibit the characteristics of fundamentalism: the assumption of a static essence, knowable immediately, of each civilization, the ability to ignore history and tradition, and the desire to lead the ideological battle on behalf of one of the clashing civilizations". 
 I bought this Basketball hoop for my son who was two and LOVED to shoot hoops.  Great height for a small kid, but difficult to adjust, latch always got stuck. Also, after a few months, the latch broke right off.  Now I have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son.  Now it is just a $30 peice of trash 
 A loony segment of the far left embraces a combination of pop ecology, Darwinism (of the Dawkins variety), a Rousseauesque delusion about the nobility of primitive hunter-gatherers, some old fashioned Chicken Little apocalypticism  and a smattering of terrorism.  Mr. Jensen, a grungy neo-Luddite, promotes all of the above in his hysterical denouncement of western civilization, particularly its capitalist manifestation.  In case you hadn't already figured it out, human beings are ecological vermin. When we developed beyond the level of wandering savages we began to infringe upon the rights of salmon and spotted owls.  The planetary crisis is now so dire that we should welcome the collapse of the modern world along with a steep drop in human population.  In other words, before we kill the planet we should politely kill ourselves because, as Mr. Jensen believes, it's a zero sum game of Gaia versus us.  Mr. Jensen, who repeatedly reminds us that he was molested by his father and that he fantasizes about blowing up a damn, appears to have regressed into an infantile dreamland where he is the hippie prophet of doom condemning the West's patriarchal rationality and its cultural achievements.  The book is interesting as long as you don't take it seriously and recognize that the author is undergoing therapy by publishing his scribblings.  I gave the book two stars because I found it was amusing enough to actually finish it.  The author's style is sometimes confessional and he provides an interesting peek into the psyche of a disaffected soul who  converted his spiritual nihilism into hatered for European civilization 
 This book wasn't quite what I expected when it arrived, but I kept it anyway since I am a Korean Studies major and can probably use it in the future.  It is somewhat "technical and scholarly" and I wouldn't recommend it for the casual reader.  If you're seriously into studying about Korea this might be an OK book 
 I give 4 or 5 stars to the "The Road Less Travelled", "People of the Lie", and "The Different Drum", but after reading 50 pages of fluff, I gave up on this one 
 And wasn't it awful. Slow, nonsensical, not to mention boring....  Basically, it's about a poor guy who finds a black pearl. And then bad stuff happens. That is all the book is about. No sub-plot, no nothing. To be honest, the best bit was when the main character's baby gets shot and dies.  The book (about 70 pages long, to be honest I can't remember. I don't want to remember) is really slow to start with, and stays that way until the last 10 pages where a million things happen at once. It is way too descriptive, and nothing remotely interesting happens. And then it just ends. It was really empty.  I have read other "Classics" such as War of the Worlds, Animal Farm, Lord Of The Flies, etc, all of which had more substance and staying power than this.  
 Janet Taylor Lisle hooks you in with a story that evokes the best of popular fantasy with some Pippi Longstocking thrown in.  Then she sucker punches you with a depressing dose of misfortune devoid of fantasy and stripped down to a cold, sad version of reality that shocks and confounds.  The denouement involves mental illness, neglect and orphaning.  For more on this kind of approach to youth literature, check out "Welcome to Lizard Motel" by Barbara Feinberg 
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
 hi just to let you guys know that i found a lot of your books are more expensive than my damn book store at my school for some reason for example this book managerial accounting for Mr Garrison is 87.00 at my school book store but at your sale it is more than a hundred as a used one can some body fix this stuff or you guys going to let a thrifty customer like me run a way from your web site  
 My girlfriend had this CD and played it for me.  I really like country music and I like some of Reba's music for this CD was way too "far out" for me!!  Some reviews here have mentioned that its too loud and overdone.  I have to agree.  I don't think much of the songs on this collection.  If you're going to buy a Reba CD I would buy her first greatest hits collection.  That's a good example of country music without Reba overdoing the vowels and syllables to her words.  Give me a break!! 
 Since Im a fashion freak, I was really excited to read this novel about a girl who comes from a family that dines and wines with designers such as Versace and Ralph Lauren.  Unfortunately, the book falls flat. The characters, the plot, even the fashion . . . they all fall flat. At times I found myself so bored that I had to put it down.   Also, even though Lily got this so called makeover from one of her best friends, she was still very much a fashion victim. It's like where did these authors get their fashion advice? They should have consulted with magazines such as Vogue or Bazaar because a fashion diva will not be caught dead wearing a pink mini skirt with a lime green top. That screams trashy not flashy!   My point is that everything about this novel is just not believable and some parts are absolutely boring.   Other than that, read at your own risk. 
  Great watch,manual very bad.All depends on how much time you have to invest.It will take it because of sorry manual 
 I am a professor of reading and use this book in the reading course required of my undergrad teacher ed students.  Our use of this book is largely strategic -- to be able to analyze and criticize Calkins' use of reading rhetoric.  This is important when one understands that the reading wars and the misguided pressures put on teachers to teach badly have intensified incredibly under the horrible No Child Left Behind legislation.  Students will be faced with such nonsense as leveled libraries and need to know what it is about and particularly, I hope, to know how to examine and counter the misguided assumptions of such practices.  Calkins' does have some worthwhile information here; as might be expected, her work is best when she is talking about how to read more deeply in order to support good writing, and how to use writing to support deeper readings.  Calkins is not a reading professional.  She should have stuck to writing pedagogy, which she does well, and left the reading texts to others 
 The essential fatty acids idea is wrong. This was proven 50 years ago! It's all marketing and distortion of the facts. Check the newsletter, at Dr. Raymond Peat's website, "The toxicity of unsaturated fats" 
 If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"  
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
 I went through the union apprenticeship in San Francisco.  I completed my apprenticeship in 2003, and decided to purchase this book to study for the CA state certification.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!  If all you are looking for is a study tool for the state certification test all you need is a code book.  In school we never used this book, and I went through a 5 year apprenticeship, and after looking through this book I can see why.  I found it almost impossible to use the index, and the table of contents wasn't much help either.  I do however reccomend the National Electrical Code 2005 Handbook.  It cost $25 more but it is well worth it.  Neither of these books will teach you how to be an electrician so don't even bark up that tree!  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!  My 8 and a half years of being a wireman (including 5 years as an apprentice)and I can't make sence of this book.  Don't waste your time or money again DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!! 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 Given that I enjoy Mr. Ford's essay collections and other writings, I was really looking forward to this book.  I won't recap the plot here, since other reviewers have done a good job of that.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it's an easy read, a "beach book," as it were.  But in the end, I found the story contrived and unrealistic, the characters without much depth, and the writing clunky and mechanical.  It wasn't completely unenjoyable, but I would have expected better from such an experienced and prolific writer as Mr. Ford.  He does create a good sense of the story's setting and location, and I rather liked Simon, the eldest member of the cast.  The erotic passages are well-written but their explicitness seems very out of place.  Overall, Ford has a tendency to use 10 words when half that number would suffice 
 Only one * because...great actors, totally unbelievably bad plot. I also didn't like the overly synthesized background sounds or the music. Old b/w movies have had better wardrobes. The booklet was missing in the dvd case, and I doubt that I would have added another * for it 
 I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could).  The author is a snob who  doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself.  If they take their "menial" jobs seriously she looks down on them.  She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement.  For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM. 
 I have been a professional cook now for about 8 years and I am maybe not the best baker in the world, but I do pretty good. After reading the reviews I decided to try this book for myself, I was looking for the Best Cupcake Recipe. Well I certainly DID NOT find it here (even though the front cover is cupcakes). The cupcakes were hard to swallow they were so heavy and oily and the icing almost made my teeth fall out. NO ONE liked them. I did find the best recipe (not from the book), but it took me 4 days and lots of trys, but I now have my own. I agree completely with the other negative reviews at least for the recipes that I tried 
 Bill, when will you just die?  if you read this feel free to email me evan.fett@gmail.co 
 I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart.  But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin 
 An abysmal read fraught with silliness!  I can hardly believe that this book is termed horror; it belongs under the heading of comical!  For instance, zombie eating killer bunny rabbits that talk, glowing balls of light that wander about supposedly doing something other than glow, carnivorous swamp trees, a plant maiden that periodically roots herself to gain strength through the earth, and most ridiculously kindly asking trees if you may jump though them to another section of the island.  Also, the whole concept of the power harnessing "dances" is absurd.  I can hardly believe that a corrupt realm such as Ravenloft would have "good" powers that could be harnessed from various silly dances and being kind to trees.  This book is not worthy of the Ravenloft title.  A thoroughly dissatisfying and torturous read!   Also recommened : Vampire of the Mists, Tapestry of Dark Souls, Baroness of Blood, Scholar of Decay, King of the Dead, and Shadowborn. 
 Buy this book if you enjoy dry, boring, off-topic, meandering and convoluted writing.  Seriously, don't waste your time.  INSTEAD, go out and buy A Beginners Guide to Constructing the Universe.  Do a search for it right now 
 This is a terrible excuse for a guidebook.  Its maps are blatantly incorrect: the subway map is a ballpark approximation, at best, and things in Central Park are not located where the map says they are, among others.  Its attraction descriptions neglect crucial information about the details you actually need at the sites (the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty in particular), and the restaurant descriptions do not show the complete picture.  I don't throw out books I dislike, but this one is going straight to the recycling bin 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 If you are getting this for a child,think about it. Kids will probably watch it 1-5 times. Save your money and buy someone Monty Python,Quest for the Holy Grail. It is a show that you can watch 100 times. It will get  there minds off of Pokemon. You have probably all ready spent a lot money  on pokemon stuff. And they barely play with it 
 There is no way that this book could be deemed jam-packed. In fact, most of the pages are only half-filled. Each two-page "chapter" is based around a quote that is very loosely tied to a topic that may or may not have anything to do with busniess. If you want to get something out of your time and money, look for books by Seth Godin, Barbara Corcoran, and Tom Peters. They really entertain as well as inform their readers 
 Oedipus was a weird book to reab, because the plot was all twisted. The characters in the book are nasty. Oedipus kills his father and has two kids with his mother.... 
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy.  I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned.  I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed.  After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines.  To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.   
 I absolutely loved this book when I read it at 12 years old, at 21 years old and I wanted to read it again and have my own copy.  This edition was so full of typing errors that it was distracting.  I can't imagine reading this copy having never read the book before.  Even having read the story I had to puzzle out the meaning of some phrases or sentences 
 Bad US dub aside (and they really should start releasing these films uncut and in their original language tracks), Twin Dragons has an interesting premise but rather shoddy execution. Through the use of various camera tricks and body-doubles, Jackie Chan plays a set of twins seperated at birth. One becomes a famous concert pianist, the other a streetwise mechanic. The trouble begins when the musical brother returns to Hong Kong for a concert, and the twins start sharing each others actions through a psychic link.   For my money, there wasn't enough of the twins interacting in the same frame, and too much of the typical 'mistaken identity' goofing associated with these stories. The effects used to make two Jackie Chans appear onscreen together are quite convincing, but the story resorts to the "one twin ducks out while the other comes in" device too often, sapping away the fun. The confusion with the two girlfriends is entertaining but ultimately overplayed, and even some of the scenes in the final car-testing area could've been cut (particularly the goofing in the heat/water rooms). My desire for a trimmer cut doesnt excuse the US version's butchering, however.  Really, Twin Dragons is worth 2.5 stars, but the sub-par US dvd keeps me from rounding up. It's worth checking out to see the fights, sunts, and some of the visual tricks, and those alone will probably make this movie memorable to fans. But objectively, it's not one of Jackie Chan's better efforts.

 This book is an excellent affirmation of Christian values that must be read by anyone who didn't realize that "The Da Vinci Code" was a work of fiction. Please reread that sentence; "The Da Vinci Code" is a work of fiction, like "Star Trek" or "Harry Potter". Unfortunately, the same people who fail to appreciate this fact are the same people who actually need to read "Cracking Da Vinci's Code," in order to restore balance to a worldview so easily upset by Dan Brown's clever yarn.   Unfortunately, this book is poor ammunition for anyone actually hopeing to defend the Christian faith from a popular fascination with the romanticized Cult of the Magdelene presented by Dan Brown. Doctors Garlow and Jones, both highly educated evangelists, have crafted a book that is more or less comfort food for their audience, not any scholarly attempt to address the factual underpinnings of Brown's novel. Somewhat pointedly, Garlow and Jones choose some of the weaker elements of Brown's novel to base their case on.  For instance, by way of dealing with non-Canon gospels (the Gnostic gospels, and the somewhat-less-offensive Apocryphal texts), Garlow and Jones give a selective history of the Council of Nicea which posits that they merely reaffirmed a version of the New Testament already in circulation. This is somewhat true, but ignores how the wording of the gospels were decided to specifically reaffirm the Nicean view of Christianity at the expense of other popular Churches of the time (including churches established by the very disciples of Jesus). They cast aspersions on non-Canon texts without actually addressing why they are or aren't considered reliable. Likewise, when it comes to a discussion of Paganism and its influence on Christian theology, the authors steadfastly refuse to acknowledge even the possiblity (much less the accepted fact) that rituals central to Christianity - such as baptism, the eucharist, and  chrism (annointing with oil or ashe) - were all employed by pagan cults for thousands of years prior to Christianity. Instead, Garlow and Jones rely on the emotional impact of the epithet "pagan" on their reader to cast aspersions and reinforcce doubt.   Most disappointing about this book is that the authors attack fiction with fiction. Where there exist stronger points in the scholarship that underpin Brown's fiction (and I can't emphasize enough that "The Da Vinci Code" is JUST an entertaining story), Garlow and Jones turn instead to a fictional couples experience attending a discussion group of Brown's book and it's central thesis, which naturally involve secularist ridicule of faithful Christians engaged in acts of ministry.   There are even a few instances where the authors manufacture assertions by inferral that were never made by Brown or any of his characters. Half way through this book, I got the distinct impression that neither Garlow or Jones (nor their editor) ever actually read Browns fictional works.  This is one of those rare books where I was relieved to finally have finished it. There is no vice in the spirited defense of ones faith through the presentation of facts in support of rational argument. Unfortunately, this book is very light on facts, and frequently resorts to emotional arguments. The Gospels tell us that Jesus himself debated with authority found in a thorough knowledge of the law, and was skilled in avoiding rhetorical traps. Garlow and Jones do the opposite: they count on the unfamiliarity and uncertainty of the general population, and frequently employ rhetorical traps. Anyone seeking to be Christ-like, and defend their faith, would do well to not rely on this book. 
 This book is one of Dean Koontz's worst.  Not as bad as THE TAKING, but right in there.  OK, here is the plot ... really, really bad guy kills girl and parents.  A girlfriend witnesses and escapes only to find herself in the hunt for really, really bad guy.  Girlfriend chases really, really bad guy and craters the guy, but that's not all.  During this (yawn!) high drama, the heroine finds a little girl that really, really bad guy has (yawwwwwn!!) captured.  After knocking off the really, really (yawwwwnnnnnn!!!) bad guy, heroine rescues little girl and adopts her. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! Oops, sorry, I nodded off.  Please Dean, can you recall this book?  I mean we aren't asking for an apology here -- just take this piece of junk off the market.  I did see where "new and used" has it for as little as 1 cent.  Uhhhhhh!  DON'T SPEND IT !!! It is not worth it !!!!  And Dean, when you are going to give your email address out to the fans?  Most authors do this.....but, you seem to be reluctant.  Could it be literary cowardice?  Inquiring minds want to know.    Much of Dean's work is excellent ..... this book isn't.  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 Karyn Seroussi does a great disservice to parents by overemphasizing a diet as means of recovering a child from autism.  The ABA portion of the story was uncomfortably small and her almost disbelief of Catherine Maurice's children being recovered with ONLY the ABA therapy left a bad taste with me.  Here's MY opinion on the whole diet thing: first of all, when children self limit their foods (as children with autism tend to do with their insistance on sameness, not for any drug-like craving) to things like chicken nuggets and candy, how the heck are they going to feel and function and how is that going to make their stools appear?  Hmm... feed them healthy foods, give them good supplements - here comes the eye contact, the better sleep at night, the better stools, the better OVERALL DISPOSITION AND FUNCTIONING.  Good eating habits are just good sense.  It is this person's opinion that you can try it if you want.  I would say to just use common sense in feeding your child well and, of course they'll do better.  My child is recovering because of ABA, and tons of hours put into that.  Mrs. Seroussi leaves that part of the story out - I'd like to know how intensive Miles' ABA therapy program was.  No offense to the author, she is a mother that was in a situation like I am now and did everything in her power to help her son, as I am.  I just think that the gf/cf diet begins to take on a cultish sort of air about it, in that if you're on the diet, well, wow - you're really doing some sacrificing for your child... and if you're not, you get the snubs of the followers that you're just not getting it...  My advice?  Just feed your child well, give them lots of love, and LOTS OF HOURS OF ABA.  This will ensure them the best chance of recovery 
 The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end 
 Storage containers arrive flat in shipping box. The four sides are created from one folded piece joined. To complete the box you fold two longer sides making two main bottom pieces which slot together (with two smaller wings from the other side). Do not plan on moving these around. They have no strength, since the bottom is only slotted together, it easily comes undone if you move the box. Only one of mine remains unbroken; creating sharp plastic edges. Not repairable. If you only intend to place a few letters, etc in the storage containers and not magazines, and the boxes are braced against something stronger (so they don't fall over) these might work. The colors are very nice. But they are not strong enough for MAGAZINES.  
 My view is skewed.  I was in VA-196 and flew with Steve Çoonts a few times as a B/N.  His book captured our collective squadron stories and placed the A6A Intruder into the public eye.  People would tell me about their experiences while reading the book...they did not know my connection to it.  Steve wrote so well that they could smell the cockpit and sense the adrenalin.  While the movie paralleled our actual experiences at sea and in port, it did not convey the excitement of the book.  So, I was disappointed in my expectations and give the film a good try. W. Stewart Tittle, Lt USNR 1966-71 
 I usually would briefly summarize the plot in my reviews, but there really isn't one to write about.  It feels like a "days of our lives" soap opera of Betsy's life...she and eric are in love, she and eric have a fight, then she and eric make up, re-wash and rinse.  I wouldn't mind this as much except Betsy is getting more annoying with each book.  I keep waiting for her to grow up and be more queenly.  Her though process is like a 13 year old, and I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up.  I feel like the author is making Betsy more immature so that she can put Betsy in sillier situations (that anyone with a brain can figure out in 2 minutes) to get a cheap laugh from the readers.  This is one book in the series that you can skip without loosing anything.  To be honest, I truly think Betsy's demon sister is a better character to read about.  Maybe the author could do that after Betsy's story fizzles out...like the next book.      
 I found this book to be disgusting, and lacking any redeeming qualities or messages.  I agree with the reader who stated the language is shocking, only for other reasons entirely.  If you don't like trash, you won't like this book 
 this book really was a piece of trash, the story line sucked. eric you can do bette 
 Buddhist math? C'mon.  First, let me say that fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are great tools. They're valued parts of the 'soft logic' kit that includes probability, interval arithmetic, Bayesian and Markov networks, and lots of other good stuff. Fuzziness involves many of the formal techniques used in probability and elsewhere, and gives a useful, alternative view of the systems it addresses.  The basic fuzzy idea is that most descriptions involve shades of gray, that few systems really match the black/white, on/off, either/or duality of standard formal logic. That's fine, I can get along with that quite well.   My problem, though, is that Kosko presents the fuzzy world-view vs. the traditional or "scientific" in exactly the black and white terms that he rejects. He also argues that fuzziness describes the world more effectively than "scientific" terms, that the rules of arithmetic, probability, and calculus are just games. They are played for their internal consistency, not because differentiation or factorials occur in nature.  That's true, and as a heavy math user I know enough to distinguish my models from reality. Two facts remain, though. First, the models very often do describe reality in ways that can be checked easily enough: the bridge doesn't fall down and the TV receives its signal. Both happen because the bad old exact arithmetic has some kind of correspondence (no, I don't know what) to the real world, giving real ability to predict real results. Second, fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are themselves mathematical formalisms, games like all the others. Once you get past the gee-whiz stage, there is mathematical content as rigorous as in any other field of study. It's not either/or, it's very often a different way to interpret the same self-consistent games people have played for years. It adds interesting rules to the game.  The great thing is that you really can use the new interpretations and tools along with the old ones. Fuzziness doesn't demolish the old structures, it bolsters them and adds capacity.   And you can get all these benefits without shrink-wrapped, bite-sized pieces of Eastern philosophy.  //wiredweir 
 Instead of talking about what you can do to help your husband make more money, why not let him help you make more money and he can stay home with the kids?  Help him triple his income and then run off with a leggy-blonde leaving you jobless and responsible for those kids.  That's a great idea 
 As PJ O'Rourke says, Liberalism is just Marxism by the glass.  It's mind-boggling to think how much of a narciscist someone has to be to imagine that they have the knowledge and wisdom to write a plan to bring to peace and happiness to an entire country.  And how out of touch they need to be to imagine that anyone else outside of a small fringe is going to even pay attention 
 First I want to state all the good things about this book - because they are certainly the principles of this book.  Dr. Andrew Weil's Eating Well for Optimum Health holds a wealth of information. Starting with the chemistry of how your body handles food and then explaining how that affects the goods and bads of what's out there is the basis in which Weil promotes his theories. In a world where foods become vilified and championed alike through various 'studies'... it can be intimidating to know what you should include in an 'optimum diet'. Weil clears a lot of this up and is pretty specific about what vitamins, minerals, whole foods and nutrients we should be nourishing our body with. All in all this is a great book on the science of food.  Now, for the bad part. I actually finished this book over a weekend, sick in bed, about a month ago. I was 'sick of being sick' as some would say and devoured (pardon the pun) this wealth of knowledge. After I was well enough to get back to my routine, I threw away almost every single food item in my kitchen, as almost nothing adhered to the optimum plan. I was still very motivated with my bare cupboards and then set out to turn my family's life around.   Dr. Weil makes it pretty clear that you are going to pretty much have to go exclusively organic, bar a few, and I mean few, fruits and vegetables. He even states that some non-organic fruits and vegetables are so toxic in their non-organic state you should never consume them - strawberries for example. Something Weil will also state is the pesca-ovo-vegetarianism diet is his diet of choice, because almost all meats are riddled with hormones that greatly impact our own bodies. The optimum food pyramid doesn't really include animal proteins, so if you aren't a vegetarian, you'll have some serious issues to resolve.  He tells you he loves food, and feels anyone who misses the point and stops enjoying food is wasting their time. I totally agree, but in practice, this book does just about that. Demonizing foods based on the fears of cancer and inflammatory disease can be a difficult pill to swallow, particularly if you've consumed these foods all of your life. The nature of label reading and being a smart consumer can literally drive you insane. It's certainly beneficial, we know that, but making it a lifestyle will require more then just a bit of education.  This book also is not for anyone seeking weight-loss through diet modification. Weil explains it certainly can be done, but he spends more time telling you what diets, such as Atkins, not to partake in. This fact is actually not a negative side to the book. However given the nations statistics on obesity I think this could have been a more helpful aspect of the book if he developed it.  I will end with this: This book could/would be an incredible useful tool if you were any or (ideally all) of the following:  1. You are wealthy. Try buying exclusively organic. It's outrageous. Most working families can not afford this lifestyle, contrary to the notion that prepared and processed foods are expensive. Prepared and process foods are cheap - that's why Americans consume them at such high rates. He suggest to organic co-op farms, but even as late as 2006 they can be scarce for most people in the suburbs, and when you do find them, they will only be cheaper then buying organic from natural food stores and chains, which isn't saying much. Don't be shocked when you find vine-ripened organic tomatoes at $5.99 a pound.  2. You do not work. Almost exclusively cooking from scratch, which is even acknowledged by Weil, will be the hardest transition for anyone who works full-time or has a family. This is probably the saddest aspect of this book. There certainly is nothing wrong with from cooking wholesome, healthy meals from scratch - but it isn't the norm for most people. If you buy the foods recommended, you'll be spending about 70% of your day in the kitchen if preparing 3 meals.   3. You already lead a healthful and active lifestyle. If this is you then you probably already knew much of Weil's intuitive advice and therefore will need only tweaking to adhere to the optimum plan.  My personal experience with this book is that you can back yourself into a corner with fear. If you work and have a family I suggest you skip this book. Working in your 5+ a day fruits and vegetables, organic or not, and leading an active lifestyle is a good place to start. The Eating For Optimum Health book creates a pretty black and white picture. And we all know life isn't black and white.   
 I've had this straightener for about 3 months - I loved it at first but now it's a love/hate relationship. The "gold" plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use. The effect, my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff! To make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates. I gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair, something that is hard to do! This is the second store brand straightener I've purchased with poor results. Save your $$$ and buy a professional model from a hairdresser - it's cheaper in the long run 
 The photography is exceedingly poor.  The items were best displayed on the models, but the close-ups were poor.  Dark colored, handpainted yarn was not the way to go to persuade anybody to try a particular pattern.  Meg Swanson's Treasury of Lace Knitting will show you how photography for this sort of book SHOULD be done.  Artsy meanderings about each project's "inspiration" in color and pattern selection didn't help. At least one pattern has an error in it.  Really, these charts are not so complex that they couldn't be proofread 
 I jused used this razor for the first time and was quite dissapointed.  After many attempts, I still has stubble this razor cannot seem to get.  Luckily I work in a factory so it doesn't matter.  I'll give it another shot after I get some electric shave or something like that.  For the price and the other comments, very dissapointed.  Stick with the razor 
 I Personally cannot stand George Michael's voice and the claims people make that he sounds closest to Freddie is absurd.  The Freddie Mercury Tribute is a great cause.. and this made lots of money.  But George  Michael, IN MY OPINION, cannot sing 
 There is no sense of style here. It is very predictable and low-brow. Nothing interesting or unique. I am guessing that anyone who likes this book is either very old or hopelessly lacking in any personal style sense. how sa 
 Campbell gets way too much credit for being intelligent. In this book, he severely mocks the Book of Genesis, a very stupid thing to do. Even if one does not believe the narratives of Genesis, its antiquity and terse language (in the original Hebrew) demand respect. Campbell's analysis of Greek myth (more like a pointless exercise in free association) is devoid of understanding. He never grasped that Greek "myth" is not myth at all but rather the history of the human race told from the Greeks' unique religious standpoint. For real understanding, I recommend THE PARTHENON CODE: MANKIND'S HISTORY IN MARBLE 
 I found this book to be poorly written and repetitive.  Needed some more peer/editorial reviews before going to market.  Could not even get past the first 3 chapters 
 I ordered this for my nursery to play a CD once in a while.  I plugged it in, forgot about it and when I went to use it a week later, could not get the CD to play.  I tried everything.  The radio worked fine but no CD player.  Wish I could send this terrible item back 
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 This is just a PR piece for the Disney company, a way to build hype so more people will buy their products and see their shows.  I was hoping for some nuts & bolts advice on designing theme parks and theme park rides.  Everybody knows how to brainstorm;  everybody knows the importance of color and lighting and music;  everybody models on computers before they make physical models.  What do Imagineers do that's different?  Do they have special techniques for brainstorming, or for choosing colors, or stage lighting?  The answers are not here.  Also, what have Imagineers learned from their mistakes?  If you take this book at face value, Imagineers have never made mistakes;  everything they've done is perfect, and any criticism leveled at Walt Disney world was later retracted or countered 
 Like a lot of people, I first heard of Venus Hum when Annette Strean (Venus Hum's lead singer) sang "Feel so good" on the Blue man group's "Complex rock tour" (a gread DVD). They announced her as Venus Hum. She rocked the house down and was the highlight of the show. So I figured that was the kind of music Venus Hum played. It's not. They're more like Techno-pop or something.  	The first few songs are kind of catchy, hence the 2 stars; but it drops off quickly after that. Guess I should have listed to the short audio clips on Amazon first 
 Well, i think some of my fellow reviewers have made the point but being English i'd just like to point out that in the 1980's this film (English title 'Beast in Heat') was placed alongside Evil Dead, last house on the left, Tenebrae and cannibal holocaust as a video nastie. Lets get this straight. It's a pile of doo doo that has no right to be placed aside genuine classic horror movies, even the nazi nasty genre should be ashamed of this drivel. It's basically an italian war movie spiced up with scenes of females being tortured in an ilsa type fashion except the director forgot to tell the maidens to act like there being tortured, i'm guessing having your finger nails pulled off with pliers would warrant a stronger response than 'ow'. Also we get a midget troll thing who's fed on ahprodisiacs who promptly tries to body slam chicks before munching on a wig placed over there special areas. It is Awful and has no redeeming features at all. In england because of our beloved (hopeless) media certain films got a reputation they didn't deserve and an audience that they shouldn't have had, this was one of them, luckily in terms of other films like Evil dead it worked in a positive light. SS Hell camp is for historians only and should be avoided if you want to be entertained, most approach this film in the hope that it will deliver what the cover promises, oh dear 
 People, I love Covenant, they have become one of my favorite groups ever.  This is total tripe compared to everything else they have ever done.  It feels like they either gave up, or ran out of creativity.  If I was them I would be absolutely embarassed by this effort, because they are capable of soooo much more. The only track I like, and I really digit, is 20 Hz.  It is one of my favorite covenant tracks ever. Everything else? Garbage. Just being honest people, don't force yourself to like it just because it is Covenant 
 worse than revisionist history, this book tries to dress up the "big lie" from the christian right and make it look presentable and scholarly. but a lie is still a lie.  this nation was founded and our freedoms established in spite of the pernicious, oppressive, and brutal traditions of the christian religion.  christianity has inspired intolerance, the inquisition, and witch burning.  when in christianity's long history did it ever inspire freedom of speech or freedom of religion or freedom of thought 
 I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only.   Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO?  I wanted to know the man.  What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have?  How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father?  How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings?   What experiences in his life molded him into what he became?  These and many other questions were not answered.   How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes?    Try it again Janet, the third time never fails 
 I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie.  I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found.  Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe.  I guess it's a little late to complain now 
 I can only say, not being a classicist, but one who did study under the esteemed Prof. Edward O'Neil of Univ. of Southern California, that I find it curious that this author does not deal much with the theories of migrations (Achaeans, Dorians later) into Greece that explain origins and approximate dates of certain myths. For example the inclusion of chthonic deities/mother earth  deities being early myths of Minoan influences, the patriarchal - sky-god myths relating to Achaeans and their influence by migration on the Greek mainland. I find H.J. Rose better at this for sure, as is O'Neil's work on Library of Apollodorus. Man, Myth and Monument,is also an excellent guide for anyone who wants to follow this fascinating aspect of myth 
 There is no measure how harmful and disastrous this "sermon" has been to all who have read or heard it.  The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation (eternal torment) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago.  The first century church never believed in a "hell".  The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from  pagan religions of the world.  "Hell" was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and "converting" effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as "orthodox" centuries after the resurrection of Christ.  Our English translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact, when it is actually fiction.  Mostly all English versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Young's Literal propagate this fallacy.  Do your homework.  Go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up.  If you scoff then here is your challenge.  Do the research from a non-traditional, non-pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise God about.  Other HIGHLY recommended books are "The Inescapable Love of God" by Thomas Talbott (ISBN: 1581128312, not on Amazon, you must google it), "The Origin and History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment" by Thomas Thayer, "The Bible Hell" by Dr. John Wesley Hanson.  Go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what "hell" is and where it came from.  You will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out.  All those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on, to you I say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of God that it creates.  THAT is hell indeed, and THAT is the ONLY hell that exists 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  I felt that the author was quite judgemental of different people's types of commitments.  I follow the Reclaiming Pagan/Wiccan tradition, & I believe that this type of book is too snobbish to have any relevance to an eco-feminist tradition 
 The simplified arrangements in this book gut the harmonic resonance of almost all the songs.  Numbers like "Dividing Day" and "The Beauty Is" are very nearly unrecognizable.  Thank you for the performance edition of "Light in the Piazza," now please,    release the Vocal Score, Mr. Guettel 
 The book is divided into two parts the first identifies the causes and nature of 'toxic shame' and the other how to heal from it.  I found the first part quite convoluted and lacking clarity he repeats things alot and seems to have invented a new vocabulary which is not always well defined.   The book uses alot of material from other authors such as Alice Miller et al. which represent the best parts of this book. There is an originality from them which Bradshaw lacks, his input felt quite biased and perhaps that is why he rambles so much.  I have begun the second part but have found it lacking, it uses the 12 step program as the ideal model for healing and somehow just throws together disparate research on healing.   If this book represents his others I think it sad that he has made a career out of simply putting forward other people's work with little valuable contribution from himself.  I found his tone somewhat preacher like and I feel he hides behind ambiguity in his language and writing style to disguise the lack of substance.  THe book does have value but only becuase of the references to other people's work.   
 Oh did this one stink.  Convoluted and confusing, the buildup to the conclusion was positively endless.  I didn't laugh once 
 I just saw Jesus in a vision and He told me that he wants you to send all your money to George H. Malkmus so he can write more books to teach all of you to be healthy so the Messiah can delay dealing with your idiotic spirits in heaven.  
 I received 50% refund on returning the product in original condition since I did not like what I received. Why such a high deduction? You should require merchant to post the refund amount when ordering. I also paid for shipping the product back thus resulting in only 25% refund of what I paid originally.  
 Wow. I had so much respect for Karajan before these recordings; I still do, but not as much. While before I viewed Karajan as being almost immortal in any interpretation of any symphony, I now know otherwise. If you want a good recording of the first symphony, get the 1964 edition of the "Originals" by Deutsche Grammophon. Karajan conducts that version much better than this one, I mean he totally butchered the first symphony here. As for the 3rd, he also trips. His 3rd symphony is not as textured or multicolored as his other recordings of the 3rd. His 2nd and 4th, while having some merits, is for the most part, dry, muddy, and without the passionate flame and directness that Brahms has to be played with 
 This reads more like a bad novel than a memoir and suffers from the same basic story being told dozens of times: sex crazed drunken slobs struggling to get lucky just before the 60's exploded.  The writing of Penthouse Forum has more variety than this.  Save your money. If you feel you must own this book, wait for it in paperback, or at the remainder bins, or your local garage sale.    
 This book has basically ruined my life. I no longer will hold to a man's standard just because he wrote a book about his personal experiences. Very old fashioned. This book does not apply to the general population of people who are Christian. This book is not recommended for people 21 and up. This is basically a childish, immature kind of book only meant for youths. Zero stars 
 When I finished reading this book I really didn't know what to think of it.  While reading it I constantly felt like I was reading a trashy romance novel with all the explicitly sexual imagery and at other times I found myself wondering if the plot was going to go anywhere at all.  The book is described as being a coming of age story of two best friends, but I think it is just a teenage pornographic novel.  I probably won't read this book again and even though it was only two hundred pages long, I feel that my time was wasted on this unsatisfying book 
 After reading reviews and listening to samples, I bought the cd.  Have to say, very disappointed.  I'm a big fan of Delerium, Zero 7, Cafe del Mar all of which are much better than this cd.  Even the new Sleepthief cd is more ethereal and listenable and I recommend 
 This movie is entirely in Swedish with English subtitles.  It is incorrectly listed as havng an English audio track.  
 I wavered awhile between three stars and two stars, because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three. However, in the end, the book's errors just piled too high. It opens well, with the story of Sony's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II, to becoming one of the world's great companies. This is a fascinating and inspiring story, and Morita tells it with flair.  Then, unfortunately, the downward spiral begins. Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way, which is a fantastically wrong assertion (as the last thirteen years of Japan's seemingly endless recession have shown). He also frequently takes good basic management techniques, like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway, and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely "Japanese".  Then there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false, such as Japan supposedly having the world's best construction technology. (It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world, as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated.)  Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything. (Yet it only recently discovered the concept of "second-hand goods", instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away. Plus, Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world's worst overpackaging.)  Reading between the lines, a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today. For example, Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States. While this can, of course, sometimes be a serious problem, it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves. Japan's consumers, on the other hand, without an accessible court system, are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives. Complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored, because they lack any threat of legal action. In another example, Morita praises the "trust" and agreements without contracts that exist among Japanese corporations. In reality, this "trust" is a death pact, as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies, instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs.  Other than the glimpses into Sony's history and corporate culture, this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of "Japan is going to take over" books that came out in the Eighties. Although, of course, considering all the "Internet companies are going to take over" books that came out in the Nineties, not even this is a uniquely "Japanese" phenomenon.   PS: Anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of Japan should read "Dogs and Demons" by Alex Kerr. 
 Although John Stanley's book covers a lot of great movies, there are many problems with the overall context. For example, he seems to only have a vague recollection of a lot of the movies. Because, a lot of reviews get the stories completely wrong. (HELP's plot is not about the Beatles looking for Ringo's magic ring. Everybody knows that!)Some actors are credited with the wrong roles. Also, there are many glaring spelling errors and a slight continuity problem: A title will say "see altertnate title", and that title and review would not be in the book! Mr. Stanley, do a little more research on your films and a more careful job of copy editing and you'll have an invaluable book. The more I read your current volume, the more mistakes I find and the more I feel I could write a better book myself 
 In this self-aggrandizing attempt to position the Braves as the most successful franchise of the past 100 years of baseball, Schuerholz offers very little insight on how to run a successful franchise and instead focuses on stories that leave you saying in the end, "who cares."    The book at times feels like it is being written on a 4th-grade reading level and I could not in good conscious recommend it to any baseball fan. 
 The reviews published above are for Bonhoeffer's book, "The Cost of Discipleship."  The book shown above, however, is a STUDY COMPANION, and not the book itself.  Bonhoeffers' actual book, as marketed by Amazon, can be found by typing 0684815001 (the ISBN) into the search box 
 As a fan of the Coen brothers I was very disappointed by this film because it was almost good.  The snappy and perfectly timed dialogue they usually have never quite materializes here.  The wonderful characters you would expect to find here are mostly hollow and not quite original or sharp.   Add to this the fact that the original is a classic and in no way needed to be remade and it's a swing and a miss.  This movie seems less like a Coen brothers movie than it does a movie made by fans of theirs that were stealing from them in uninspired ways 
 If you want to read a book on risk management, this may be not the book to read. This book is interesting as an applied math book for say some application in risk management but not as a risk management book. The main application of this book is credit risk. What does the reader learn ? Nothing about how to compute the spread of a CDO's tranche, nothing about how to manage correlation risk, nothing about how to  manage spread risk, nothing about the real value of the calibrated intensity and nothing about the real value of the spreads. Needless to say, you will learn nothing about the new indices such as i-traxx for calibration. As a risk management book, it is a rather poor book. However, you will learn many things on time series, stochastic intensity models, copula and so on. In fact, the right title is "Mathematical and Statistical methods for risk management in view". Bearing in mind that this is an applied math book, it is well written and contains a lot of material that can be interesting. As a consequence, this book is rated with 1 star as a risk management book but with 4 stars  as an applied math book. 
 This poor frightened author! How very very sad to operate from a base of fear so powerful that one must condemn any who vary the slightest in their belief or approach.  Agnes Sanford did good work and devoted her life to helping others.  Most fundamentalists declaring that anyone different from themselves is BAD are simply very frightened people.  By attacking and condemning others they make themselves feel a little bit more secure in a world that is scary and at times overwhelming.  I am so sorry she is spewing this vitriol in an attempt to feel safer 
 After hearing good things about the book I had hoped for some insight on how to change the approval seeking patterns developed from living in family where being good worked alot better than being authentic. Instead I got heavy handed criticism of "mothers" who warp their children through thier own selfish motivations. Some people may have parents who were intentionally cruel, but mine were just sad, depressed and inept. I spent so much effort defending them from this author's wrath, and perhaps anger at her own mother, that if there was any insight in this book about on how I might change my patterns of behavior I couldn't see it. 
 Yes it's true. The book of Sen it`s too much focused on the "theory of social choice" and it never makes an analysis of freedom and rationality by a pure philosophical point of view, but always by the point of view of the "social choice".  And it's also true that this kind of analysis is often related to the impossibility theorem of Arrow, as all the social choice theory could be reducted to that theorem  I think the title of the book does not say the essence of it,  People philosophically intrested in these two concepts should read something else... 
 Unfortunately, my experience with this product is less than stellar.  For one, I am a very hairy man.  A VERY HAIRY MAN.  The look was completely different from the picture.  Secondly, upon closer inspection of the product pictured, it appears that the model has a SOCK stuffed in the front!  That must be what they mean by super sock.  Anyway, when I crammed my package in there, it looked a prairie dog popping up out of its hole.  Lastly, watch out for the string...it gets stinky 
 Who wouldn't want to star in a movie they write and direct. Who wouldn't want two attractive women to fight over them in the story line. If you have the money and can make the movie, why not? But PLEASE keep your adventure into egotism to yourself. 1.) The star can not act. 2.) The director allows this film to go overboard and loses control. 3. The writing is so filled with such swagger and egocentric dialogue it is as if the writer is screaming "LOOK AT ME I AM FUNNY AND CLEVER!!!" I am sorry to say you are not. And what makes this worse, the writer, director and star  are all one person. This movie could have been saved if the star/writer/director put a talented attractive (I am sorry but you have availed yourself to critics) actress to play off the two supporting actresses (who can act and are quite attractive)....Of course you would still have the dialogue but it would have been easier to watch.  I hope it was worth the money to stroke the ego of Ms. Lesnick (actor/writer/director), but please you would have been better off donating the money to charity. I imagine she is an actress/writer who can not figure out why she can not get work, so she decided to hire herself. Who now can say "LOOK AT ME I AM A STAR OF A MOVIE." The trouble is if she saw the dailies each day while filming she should have fired herself 
 This book is so far from Krentz's best romantic novels (Grand Passion, Absolutely Positively), that I would have believed it written by some other romantic novelist because it was so predictable and boring.  The heroine has this "amazing" ability to tell where people have been murdered, but there is no way for her to use this ability to try to solve crimes & contribute to her husband's detective business.  Her husband is a private investigator who somehow manages to stay afloat financially, since he spends most of the book picking out color schemes for his home (Ochre or gold, ooh, the mystery!).  There are a couple of romantic subplots where friends of the couple who have previously been unlucky in love suddenly discover each other & decide that they're perfect for each other.  At the end of the book, you end up with a clumsily-plotted attempt to kill one character, a bunch of references to some nutty mental institution where two of the characters were held captive, three soppily happy couples dancing in the sunlight and one majorly bored reader who wishes she had picked another book for her weekend read 
 I can't believe folks would buy this garbage. The title of this book and much of its content were ripped off (yes, plagarized) from George Carlin's bit "Religion is a Mental Illness". But that is not unusal as Mr. Weiner has ripped off other people's work throughout his career. I hope see this guy for the fraud he is 
 The shoes which I received appeared to have been slightly used.  I would not use this merchant adain 
 If you pick up a mystery at the grocery store, you don't expect Hemingway.  Or even Russ Francis.  But this is really just like a bad novelization of a middling episode of "Law and Order CI".  The good men are all craggy and strong and sensitive to women.  The women are all good unless they're hookers or junkies.  All of them, at some point, beat up or kill a man.  The bad men had bad experiences with their mothers. Wives are more successful than their husbands, who are as petulant as a teenager with a used Chevrolet.  In all fairness, there is a decent plot, but it has petechial hemorrhage from the ligature of Dr-Phil-level psychology and daytime-drama characters.  The least you expect from a cheap mystery is that it will be better than the average police-procedural tv show.  This one fails the test.  Save your $5 and watch reruns of Bones or NCIS 
 The Callahan's short stories have always been among my favorites -- they're funny, uplifting, clever and sometimes deeply moving. Spider Robinson has written a wide variety of other short stories that are also intelligent and witty.  Unfortunately, none of the Callahan's novels are particularly good; it wasn't fun when Heinlein went off for a hundred-odd consecutive pages about how cool his characters were, and at this point that's what the Callahan's novels have degraded into.  The plot here is that Jake's new bar in Key West has been targeted by Tony Donuts, Jr., the son of an unmemorable villain from one of the Lady Sally books. They come up with this silly, over-elaborate plan to get Tony's mobster boss to whack him, focused on the time travel powers of Jake's irritating precocious daughter. The subplot also revolves around said daughter, as a Child Protection agent shows up, a bizarre cariacture of conformity who's identical to (and turns out to be related to) the bizarre cariactures of conformity that got Jake's previous bar shut down.  After a long sequence of Robinson trying and failing to write a sci-fi Carl Hiaasen novel, there's a wholly manufactured crisis that has nothing to do with the previous story -- because every Callahan's novel has to end with a repeat of the super-empath sequence from "The Mick of Time."  Save yourself some tsuris and go re-read the original stories -- or pick up one of Robinson's compilations of short stories, such as By Any Other Name. That's where he really shows his strength 
 I am a graduate student at ASU.  This book is part of the required course materials, since Montgomery is affiliated with ASU.  The quality of this textbook is what you may find in a mediocre $40 statistics book.  I have not seen statistics dealt with in a more confusing manner.  Explanations are incomplete, graphs meant to illustrate concepts are not labeled, symbols and functions are used without defining them, and there are errors in the examples.  My understanding was that D. Montgomery has been in this field for a long time.  However, basic principles, like including units with the data, are ignored.  I expected by the 6th attempt these problems would have been worked out.  The other reviews do not make sense to me, since my classmates feel a similar frustration with the book 
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 I have read Mr. Train's earlier books The Money Masters and The New Money Masters and found them informative and interesting, gaining insights from some of the worlds most sucessful investors. Mr. Train's research seemed to rely heavily on personal interviews of these Masters often providing the reader with unique investment philosophies  not readily available elsewhere. I especially recommend Mr. Train's first book in this series The Money Masters because this book moved me away from the trading of stocks and futures as practiced by Robert Wilson the short seller and Stanly Kroll the great commodity speculator. The techniques they employed seemed too elusive and fraught with risk and if this was the basis of the trading game it was not the game for me. I was instead attracted to the similer philosophies of mentor and student Ben Grahman and Warren Buffett. Looking at a stock as a share of a business not a piece of paper with a number on it. This   was the first time I had been exposed to the wisdom of these two investors and I am grateful to Mr. Train for revealing to the public their methods. The problem I have with the current rendition is that it really adds nothing new. In fact Mr. Train seems to have copied parts of the first Money Masters and spliced them into this version. I may be wrong but it doesn't seem that the effort or creativity that went into the original went into this work. Another sort of irritating quality in this instance thankfully not present in the first book is Mr. Train's need to psychoanalyze some of his subjects especially Mr. Buffett. This adds an edge to the book that is not worthy of Mr. Train 
 Alanis Morissette has one of the most irratating singing voices I have EVER heard. I would literally kill myself if I ever forced to listen to her music for an hour straight. If you want to listen to some annoying chick yodel, buy this piece of crap people call music. 
        The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.        In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.         His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much. 
 What happened to this book?  It is a disgrace to the star wars universe.  It's practically a Star Wars dictionary, that's all.  In spite of the good pictures, this book was very disappointing!!! 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 I was very disappointed with this rain suit. I bought it, especially after seeing the above review, since I too bicycle to commute. I'm not sure if they sent me a different rain suit or what, but the one I got didn't have the overall pants. I bike an hour each way and, after the first ride, the pants have holes around the bicycle seat area and the material is breaking down at other points in the pants as well. The jacket immediately started coming away from the bottom snap. (Definitely not a "rugged" suit!) I didn't have a problem with being too hot, although perhaps that is because this is springtime in New England. I wouldn't bother buying this suit unless your commute is quite short. 
 This was a bad movie, the acting was horrible, the dialogue was laughable, and some of the action sequences were ridiculous! Especially that one scene where they blantantly "borrow" scenes from Terminator 2.  It's insane they use scenes straight from the movie, from when they tried to break into Cyberdyne systems. And they didn't even change that name they kept it, Cyberdyne systems. It was a very sad thing to see 
 I usually read novels, thick and thin, within a week; but this book took months. I couldn't stand to read more than a few pages at a time because it was just that terribly written. It was probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I'd much rather read a boring textbook on math theory than read this again.  I don't understand how it won the awards it did because I don't think it deserved it.  The progression was dreadfully slow, and many times the author was redundant and appears to be just filling space. Also, I don't think it dealt much with apartheid at all, but more so about a dysfunctional family in general.  And Michael's rage and his driving force (in the end) was really appalling and so fitting with the sensationalism in society and the media today.  This book was rubbish and I wish there was a 0 star rating because it definitely isn't even worth one. Don't waste your time 
 Misleading pictures... the Holster is Triangular.. not Rectangular as the picture would suggest.. Also, it does not fit well with the RAZR phone... I'm afraid the phone will fall off any second if I use it... This one goes to the trash can.. 
 High Expectations.  A worthless book 
 Choose your attitude, Play, Make their day and be present.  There I saved you the 2 hours it takes to read this book 
 very cute for my3 year old niece,but not durable to leave her alone with i 
 Bought solely from positive reviews.  Usually love the obscure hard to find melody type music.  However, this was the first time I have ever found nothing redeeming at all and proceeded to put the cd in the trash.  "Whatever" is all I thought while listening.  You win some and lose some on buying solely from reviews which I love to do, kind of like educated gambling.  Speaking of, research/reviews led me to Destroyers Rubies at the same time which I love 
 Advil liquigels are excellent for headaches.  I am writing this review to warn customers that this product from Amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks (as advertised).  I ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped.  It is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store (like I had to eventually do when I ran out) 
 This book is not much better than having the Brady text. The answers are not explained and you can argue many of the 
 Very disappointing. Summing this book up in one sentence would read - "We're all genentically so similar it makes no difference, all religions are bunk, why don't we all hold hands and love each other?"  To elaborate a little, this book is a loose collection of ideas strung together by dubious inferences derived from incomplete and poorly referenced source concepts that atttempts to reduce the highly complex to the banal.   We read about how "psychopaths" and personality disorders are biological in origin (essentially), so these people can't help their behaviour, but oh wait, they have a choice so their actions really are their fault (just like WW1, in the author's view, was all Kaiser Wilhelm's fault).   We read that religion is the result of a "reglion center" in the brain, religions cause wars, there's so many of them none of them are right, and the author has never met anyone who pratices what they preach so all religions are bunk and the source of much discord, the inference being we should discard them in favour of...? A rather pathetic and trite "conversation" with a theologian is also presented as evidence as to why religion holds no answers (ignoring the billions who could present a more cogent argument either pro or con religion off the cuff than the one presented).  The reader is invited to engage in anthropomorphism in examining the social behaviour of various groups of apes and monkeys with the author wondering why we can't be more like them (ummm, because I'm human and a good deal more complex? (and besides which, I have no desire to live in a tree and spend my time grooming others for fleas)).  We also take a trip to the stars - or rather we don't - as the author rambles for some time about how far away stars are, how we could never get there, Einsteins theory of relativity and so on ad nauseam - what this has to do with holding hands and being nice to each other I don't know, but I suspect it's about being stuck on this rock together.  The books essentially trails to a distinctly uncompelling end after meandering around enormous issues that have plagued the best and brightest throughout the ages all the while cavalierly dimissing this or that point of view in favour of poorly supported author opinions, derived, as mentioned, from odd-ball bits of information loosely strung together.  I rarely write reviews, preferring to let others (and myself for that matter) read and digest materials independent of prejudice. In this case, I was so annoyed about the quality of the arguments and the tenuous support for them that I felt compelled to make my opinion public. Read it for yourself if you enjoy being irritated - be warned, however, that when you're finished you'll be wishing you'd spent your money on something more productive, like video games, or renting National Lampoon's Vacation etc 
 This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this 
 not a good script kind of slow, a regular movie if You are into history In America, but If You dont live there, or got any interest in this particular plot, I wont recomended, is borin 
 Using this book as a required text for a brush up/seminar course for an MBA program, I've found this book did not do enough reviewing for me with regards to creating financial reports-- income statement, statement of cash flows, balance sheet, etc. I had managerial accounting, financial accounting and financial management in undergrad, however, this book still lacks the concrete basics of "what goes where on a financial report and why". Speaking to my undergrad accounting department chair, I found my opinion agreed with her's-- Kimmel is verbose and lacks clarity/simplicity for those without an accounting focus or background 
 I found this book to give some false information and mix up the stories. the dates and names are wrong..needless to say i was dissapointed 
 Gore Vidal is not without talent as a writer, but whatever ability he possesses is sadly misplaced when he tries to do political analysis.  Somehow, his take on the real world ends up looking and sounding like a fantastical plot from a cheap novel.  No, that's not quite right, because Vidal is too conspiratorial to make a good plot for even Ian Fleming's most outlandish villain.  When did Vidal become incapable of simple common sense?  Does he perhaps partake in chemicals?  That might explain the hallucinogenic nature of "Dreaming War", including the psychodelic title.  In "Dreaming War", Vidal imagines conspiracies so ridiculously complex and intricate that they make even the semi-serious Illuminati drivel from the nineties seem plausible by comparison.  Vidal does poor research, badly documents what he does, and then draws conclusions not supported by even the molecule-thin evidence he bothered to produce.  But then, why sweat the details when you're just in it for a quick payday from anti-capitalist sycophants who will buy into anything that might help them to see the USA (and especially our evil military) humbled and free markets destroyed.    And lest I forget, Vidal must ever continue to feed into his cult of personality so his followers will stroke his ego in all the right ways.  Sadly, none of them have the nerve to tell Emperor Vidal that his shaky logic is naked for all to see.  But in the end, who cares?  I say let the Vidalians continue to wallow in their own little la-la land along with their elitist liberal buddies. I live in the real world where none of his rantings are valid anyway.    By the way, in the real world, western civilization is worth saving from Wahabbist lunatics who would gladly behead even Gore Vidal if given half the chance.  In that sense, Vidal is just another anti-American kook who supports a position that if successful, would only serve to bring about his own death, like the rest of the anti-war movement.    What part of "survival of the fittest" don't they understand?  For an analysis of the illogic of Vidal's position (and that of silly people like him), I direct you to UNHOLY ALLIANCE: RADICAL ISLAM AND THE AMERICAN LEFT by David Horowitz 
 This book is a disappointment. As a lifetime Trekker I thought it would be wonderful. But there were too few ships and the illustrations were poor 
 One day I decided I needed to read every type of book out there. I usually ready fantasy novels. I wanted to know if I'd be interested in other books besides fantasy. I picked up a horror novel and it was slightly entertaining. Started to read a historical fiction novel but never finished. Then I picked up this up. I read the whole thing and decided never again to read a romance novel. This guy I forget his name now but he was so pathetic and weird. He wants to marry some girl from the telephone...stupid! But what pissed me off was the ending! DUMB 
 Let me qualify something.  I have a two year old.  This book is not good for a two year old.  Pictures: Poorly done, with some artistic watercolors that are really to dark.  Not a bright happy and pleasing in the illustration department.  The pictures are really elementary in skill level.  Story:  This book is really just a huge social message about the loss of habitat for certain animals.  I dont think that little kids really can conceptialize this let alone care.  The message also offers no solution to the problem.  Leaves you hanging at the end as you wonder if you missed something.  Text: Not a rhyming book.  Actually, just did not have good flow.  I hate to be the odd man out here, but for MY purposes - not a book that I would recommend you buy 
 I bought this coffeemaker as replacement for my Starbucks model that I accidentaly damaged. Unit stop working after a month. Quality and taste of coffee could not compare with my Starbucks machine which unfortunately is discontinued (I am not sure who built coffe maker for them, now they sell Kitchen Aid and Delonghi) I took my coffeemaker to local authorized repair shop. They told me that this is nonrepairable model and that I will receive replacement in 4 weeks, I even had to pay $12.50 for shipping. Its been more than 8 weeks, deLonghi customer service will not deal with customer and repair shop told me they are out of stock and there is nothing thay can do about it. Most of electronics stores have 30 days return/exchange policy and if your unit fail within this period, return it and buy something else. I did not do my homework since I did not consider coffemaker purchase to be major one but after reading horrible reviews about this product I would like to warn future customer of making same mistake 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 More time could have been spent in Ney York City for this movie. Like with Friday The 13th Part Seven: The New Blood, all of the good gore scenes were cut out. But still, this is a terrible movie and I am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five 
 Let me first say that once upon a time I liked Larry The Cable Guy.  After reading this book, I now think he is one step above slime. To be fair, some jokes ARE funny and some stories ARE enjoyable and amusing.  He is anti-PC which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Moore, Barney Frank, Barbara Streisand, and "that fat girl from the Dixie Chicks", among others.  No problem there in my opinion. That is the entirety of the positive things I can say about the book.  The rest is just babble, often repeated over and over again, that even Larry lovers will find annoying.  A couple things that really bothered me.  The first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of "retards" and Down's Syndrome children.  He must use the term "retard" at least fifty+ times in the book.  This is appreciably different than making a joke about, say, Michael Moore.  Moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes.  The Down's Syndrome children did not. My opinion of Larry The Cable Guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on "retards".  He also racially sterotypes in the book.  Many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond.  The Down's Syndrome kids can't.  Larry, I can only hope God (in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book) grants you a "retard" child to love and care for.  Then, I would like to read your next book. I suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly.  The second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that Larry is a fraud in many senses.  He plays the good 'ol Bubba. He ain't too bright and he ain't ever changed since he left the farm.  His "celebrity" - his word not mine - has not gone to his head. OK, Larry. Why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures, including serious topics such as abortion?  Why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down?  Why the unrelenting references to your "celebrity"?  The terms "meet and greet" and "after-party" were used over and over and over, as an example.  Do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are?  Well, you are wrong.  They are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become.  That's Hollywood-speak my country, fart loving, nose picking friend.  Overall, this book is a true disappointment and Larry The Cable Guy is a true moron (see doesn't that sound better than "retard").    My Father always taught me there are two types of dumb people.  Those who are dumb and know they are dumb.  And those who are dumb but are so dumb, they don't realize it.  The former category usually shuts up (knowing they are dumb).  The latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter. The first group is obviously smarter than the second.  Larry The Cable Guy falls smack dab in the last group.  The fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book. Make jokes, Larry, and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like.  Unfortunately, Larry can't see the obvious.  Like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book, he has become exactly one of them.  A thin layer of "Good 'Ol Boy" on top, covering a core of venom and "celebrity". He plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets.  My suggestion: Don't buy Larry's act and, by all means, don't buy the book.   
 This book is a horrific let down.  While admittedly no one expects to it be the next Lord of the Rings, I have rarely read a novel as poorly written and unbelievable as this.  I found the entire book felt like it was written by a grade 9 student.  Medically, it was accurate, but english wise, it was atrocious.  While reading this, I felt like it was a glorified Nancy Drew books, you know, the ones we all loved when we were 6 or 7 years old.  the characters are superficial and unbelieavle, the scenerios and plot are even more artificial.  The character of Tony is one of the most unrealistic fictional characters I have ever come across.  It was pretty obvious the author knew absolutely zip about organized crime when he wrote this book.  Overal, a very poorly written and unbelievable book.  No one is expecting Shakespeare, but we're at least hopeing for some entertainment.  This was painful to read 
 this book gives an overview of witchcraft in many forms and how it has been viewed over the centuries by differing religius sects. a long read but good to balance out the positive and negative views of outsiders to the craft 
 I can't take it.  I absolutely loved the earlier Kay Scarpetta novels, but this one? Um, no.  First, the writing style is completely different from the earlier novels, it's like someone else wrote it using Patricia's name.  It seemed very disconnected, nothing more than a whole bunch of ideas taken from fan-fic works.  In places, the book was very hard to follow and there were a lot of places where I looked up and said to no one in particular "what was the point of that?"  Second, Benton.  Give me a break, it was like reading a bad sci-fi novel, although it did give some meaning to a phrase from one of the earlier novels, Black Notice I think, when Marino made a remark about what Kay would think if Benton wasn't really dead.  I actually spent an hour scouring through the earlier novels just to find that line.  Third, what kind of friends would allow someone to grieve for a person who isn't really dead?  It's heartless!  Finally, I have the book Trace.  Have I read it?  No.  It was a gift for my birthday and eventually I will probably read it, out of little more than morbid curiosity about how these characters will be forever tainted this time.  I got through about ten pages of Trace and haven't picked it up again in 6 months, opting instead for Wendy Corsi Staub.  Overall, if you're a fan of the Scarpetta novels, don't read this book.  It will change the way you look at the entire series.  I will be content with the older books and try to block out this black mark on an otherwise fabulous author 
 I haven't read the book but the 6 hour audiobook was fairly slow for what could have been much more interesting considering the subject matter.  It seemed like the author really has an axe to grind against the CIA.  The stories seemed overly focused on any mistakes the CIA made.  The author lost credibility with me when he said he was the one who revealed the presence of the secret nuclear bunker that was to be used by the US Congress in the instance of a nuclear strike. 
 This movie is a dog, pure and simple. We ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few DVD players we bought. They can't sell it, so they're giving them away.  Hide ...fast  
 Aircraft design from a Cranfield University perspective ONLY. Siginificant aircraft and designs are not discussed. Don't waste your money.  Better books: Fundamentals of Aircraft Design by Leland Nicolai, Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach by Daniel P. Raymer or, for a multi-volume approach, try Aircraft Design by Jan Roskam 
 Use Maxell or Fuji disks.  They work flawlessly 
 The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. 
 I have tried many pilates DVD's with and without props and this one is not worth paying or doing.  The instruction is ok, quality of video is good BUT the workout itself is 40 minutes of nothing really... very disappointing! 
 Before browsing through Dear Donald, Dear Bennett, the reader should immediately peruse a copy of At Random, Bennett Cerf's memoirs, so he has a chance of understanding what he is reading in this book. I can't believe Random House would treat the personal letters of their founders in such a shabby fashion. Virtually no footnotes, no annotation, no index---nothing. They might as well be putting out the memoirs of Anna Nicole Smith, rather than the keepers of one of the great literary storehouses of the twentieth century. Before spending any money assembling this volume for publication (if indeed they spent any at all!), the editors should have acquired a copy of The Noel Coward Diaries and followed it religiously as a guide. In that volume, Graham Payn and Sheridan Morely obviously spent months poring over every inch of copy, meticulously footnoting each and every name and archane reference so that upon completion, the reader would easily be able to tell the difference between Bob Menzies and Bobby Andrews, the Duke of Kent from the Duke of Windsor, and easily tell whether Sir Noel was writing about Elizabeth Taylor the film star, Elizabeth Taylor the English novelist, or Elizabeth Taylor the non-celebrity dear friend to Coward's inner circle. Here, the editors (who are unnamed and rightly so) merely say that Saxe Commins was a senior editor at Random House and Robert Haas a partner without furthur definition. (More time is spent discussing the typeface of this volume than virtually anything else.) Most readers of these letters would be interested in the details such annotation would provide. Yes, the letters do paint a wonderful picture of the day-to-day operations of the company, the trials and tribulations of America at war, and the deep affection between the two men. It's a shame the present-day editors at Random House did not see fit to put together a better tribute of their founding fathers 
 This was my first and last Joe Weber book. The story was predictable and the characterizations were not compelling. It's not that Weber is a bad writer, it's just there are others who are so much better. I would rather read a bad book by a good writer than a good book by a bad writer. I love Clancy type books but this fell way short. He gets 2 stars for effort 
 I couldn't continue after 5 minutes of this movie.  It portrayed Americans as incompetents and hopeless.  The message is that we will all suffered if there are no mexicans in America because we won't know what to do. This movie really sucked big time. And most of all it wasn't even funny. I can't wait till they come up with a movie titled "A day without Mexican: no more law braking illegals, no more uninsured motorists, surpluses in governmental resouces, uncrowded ER, less crime, etc 
 This book is a bore. Middle class English in the 60s. Everything that needs to be said has been said. Why bring this subject back up in the 1990s. Another English writer who writes beautifully but unfortunately, has nothing to say 
 If you are afraid that sociopaths are learning effective ways to kill ,then this book will put your fears to rest. One of Minnery's suggestions is to find out what hotel room your target is staying in. Then rent two  hospital X-ray machines and position them in the two rooms adjacent to the  target's room. Aim them through the walls at his bed and crank them on. The  target will die of leukemia. The only practical method in his entire How To  Kill series was Hatchet To The Medulla. If these books were required  reading for every would-be killer in America the homicide rate would drop  considerably 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 A very lackluster effort.  Sophomoric lyrics and for the most part had nothing to distinguish itself.  I liked the title track a lot, and a couple of other ballad type songs, but the rest was poorly done and little imagination 
 This is one of the greatest books ever written 
 I don't know about you folks, but I have small ears.  Though the sound on these ear buds are good, I can't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they're too big for me, and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears.  Unfortunately, this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords. Good idea, badly designed for size differences. 
 This is one of the most influential and most useless books on Hitchcock. The book is very telling, not of its subject matter, but of the author. Sadly, the book received a lot of undue attention and its misconceptions have still not sufficiently diappeared. Absolutely horrendous 
 generally a big fan of Cara Black but this latest is a big mound of material searching for a decent editor. Even for a big fan its a slog. I think that there is a fine book buried in the text but whomever is claiming to be the editor of this book should be fired - it's a mess.  Second Draft (maybe) but ready for publication it is not!  
 The Bancroft is the history profession's Pulitzer, so I was looking forward to being edified.  What I got instead was an impenetrable tome consisting mainly of fashionable deconstructionist babble about how war is defined among different cultures.  I read and read and never found a coherent narrative about what this war was supposed to be about or what it had to do with American identity.  Perhaps this "language of academe" impressed the Bancroft committee, itself made up of pedants, but to the common reader, whom the academy putatively serves, this thing is worthless.  I have the feeling that these guys began reading, and when their eyes started to glaze over they said, "My kind of history! 
 I love the Firebird imprint and was excited to read this book and "Ecstasia", its predecessor.  Ugh.  I barely made it through this quadmire of perverse sex and terrible poetry.  I find it completely inappropriate for a teen novel (yes, I know, teens have sex) to be so overtly sexual.  Every page, every paragraph practically was full of plain ol' sex, bestiality, masturbation, homosexual and bisexuality.  Sure, it was couched in flowery prose and open-ended verse, but it still boils down to pornography when you take away the fluff.  And, while Primavera's childish songs were marginally better than the ones in "Ecstasia", I'm still hard-pressed to imagine how anyone could sing meterless, beat-less, pointless verse like that.  Never mind that it didn't rhyme, I'd like to see the tune that could follow any one of those arbitrary lines!  Bleah 
 i bought 2 sets of these (blue and black) because of the price and to really stock up.  they look nice and just as pictured but the fit on these is less than desirable.  if you (or your man) like to just wear their boxers when lounging around the house they may find these have an awkward feel and constraint.  because of this constraint as far as movement i DO NOT recommend anyone wearing these if they plan on being even remotely active during their day.  played a couple hours of basketball and these boxers were not comfortable at all.    for everyday lounging while wearing shorts/pants then they feel fine. for someone who likes to run, jog, or play sports, i highly recommend finding a different set 
 Very hard to understand and too detailed for the average dog person.  The book may be good for someone specializing in dog behavior, but it is written as if every dog has some sort of behavior problem.  I found other  books to my liking.  I got only 1/3 of the way with it and donated it to my  local library 
 The book is easy to follow and is interesting, but it's not entirely about Dan Osman, around half of it is just autobiography of the writer itself. At the begging it makes sense for the author to write about his experience, but after a while it just gets too much! It wasn't exactly what I was expecting.   
 I don't know who wrote all these raving reviews, but after buying into their hype and buying the CD and listening to it, I'm wondering who paid these guys off.  Not bad songs technically, just something you'll never play more than once.  No glimpses of genius; no euphoria; no whispers of one's primordial soul to rememberence; no passion.  Better to donate to the Red Cross than to waste your $ on this one.. 
 I was a bit surprised that this book (essay) received such high marks from so many reviews.  For all its purported brevity, it is remarkably repetitive and filled with extraneous tangents.  Its 150 pages (with 2004 afterword) could easily be trimmed down to 50-60 pages without losing much content.  Kagan's major claims are the following: (1) Europeans and Americans  have divergent perspectives regarding international relations and foreign policy (Britons tend to find themselves in the middle); (2) These different perspectives are relatively recent and have not been the norm over the long span of history; (3) America has always seen itself, and esp. in the last 60 years, as a pro-active agent of liberal democracy in the world; (4) The United Nations has no practical legitimacy; (5) The precepts of national sovereignty and of moral intervention are mutually conflicting; (6) Barring an unforeseen disaster, the U.S. will continue to dominate world affairs as it sees fit; (7) Unless Europe finally "comes on board" with the U.S., the net power of liberal democracies in the world may decrease enough to threaten world security.  It does not take a tremendously perceptive reader to gather that this essay is basically an apologia for the Iraq War.  As such, evidence and observations are gathered very selectively, and a handful of points are drilled at repeatedly.  One of these is the fact that the Kosovo intervention by Europeans was illegal, in that it violated international law.  Kagan argues, in essence, "If Europe didn't mind invading Kosovo illegally in 1999, why should they care about Iraq in 2003?"  This is a legitimate question to ask, but Kagan's analysis is superficial, as it must be to maintain his position.  Today, in November 2005, the differences are all too clear: Kosovo was an intervention into genocide and ethnic cleansing, based on human rights and humanitarian reasons; Iraq was an intervention into a failing dictatorship, taken to satisfy grandiose foreign policy aspirations and provide lucrative contracts for corporations, and based on fraudulent evidence and countless lies.  The issue of the conflict between international law and moral intervention is a legitimate one, but Kosovo/Iraq is a false comparison.  There are other glaring omissions and/or howlers that speak volumes: the enormous costs of the advocated "preventive" foreign policy, the mounting defecits and debt are barely mentioned in passing once or twice.  Kagan even states at one point that "Economically, [America] can go alone in the reconstruction of places like Iraq if it absolutely has to -- five decades ago, after all, it reconstructed Europe and Japan with its own funds."  Yes, but not while the government was run by a cabal cutting taxes and spending more than anyone previously.  Henry Kissinger is described as a "quintessential realist"!  Kagan even states, "Americans do not argue, even to themselves, that their actions may be justified by raison d'etat."  I wonder what country he's living in -- oh, that's right, he lives in Belgium now!  Kagan set himself up for a difficult task -- defending the Iraq War by deflecting attention from the facts of that sham and resorting to political rhetoric and philosophising.  No wonder it comes across as a badly-written college term paper.  His faith in American moral superiority is unquestioned.  And this is where his thesis falls apart -- if "might is right", and you have the might, you assume you do right...but what if you're wrong? 
 I was really disappointed in this movie, as Johnny Depp seems to sleepwalk through the entire role, and shows none of his previous greatness from other roles. And the two tone hair? Not a good look.  My dad has all of Stephen King book's but the last couple he has read, he has either struggled to get into, or found it was too similar to previous novels. I've read a couple, but watching this, I discovered every Stephen King stereotype/cliche is included. The loner eccentric writer, by himself in the middle of nowhere, the strange man - just everything about this film.   There's also a very unexpected twist, which not only ruins what was already a mess before the twist hits, but comes so abruptly, that you have to actually pause the film and work out what on earth is going on. The 'twist' has become the most overused solutions in Hollywood in thrillers etc of the past few years, and they're getting worse, and more predictable each time. For me, the twist completely ruined this film. Other reviewers disagree.  Maria Bello, the fabulous bar owner from Coyote Ugly, is seriously underused, and underdeveloped as a character, that it's a waste of time in even having her in the movie.  Major disappointment. See some of Johnny's earlier films for his best work. And if you want to see something really off the wall, watch Benny & Joon.  And on that note: "Rah! Rah! Rah!"  Quite.  And there was absolutely nothing 'thrilling' about it 
 It's not too difficult to understand how "Behold a Pale Horse" has become "the best selling underground book of all time"(according to a blurb on one pro-Cooper website)--after all, people want to(and do) believe in outlandish things. The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental "Tragedy and Hope".) To all the "if you can't handle the truth, don't read this book!" reviewers who know little to nothing about Bill Cooper: I invite you to do a Google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth, the real truth. Milton William Cooper was a certifiable headcase. Numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard-drinking, ill-tempered, violent man who was incredibly easy to fool. Cooper's contention that John F. Kennedy was killed by William Greer, the driver of his limo in Dallas, is of course well-known...but he also believed, and told audiences at his lectures, that the aliens on the Fox television show "Alien Nation" were real aliens. He wasn't kidding. Cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information, then take it--and repeat it!--as gospel. Fellow "fringe" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow.   I'll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper's death were suspicious. I feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end, and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to "Pale Horse". This was a human being with real feelings...but he was very, very disturbed. There are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally; so many that "Behold a Pale Horse" should NEVER become any conspiracy theorist's bible.     
 The cookbook is more a sales pitch for Santa Fe and their restaurant. Found better and more interessting recipes on the internet. Not sure why they thought their recipes were that good. 
 Lack of balance...if one thing could be pointed at as the problem, it is the lack of balance.  The battle system was a good attempt and it sounded great on paper but it just didn't pan out. As has been mentioned, the number of enemies and the speed of enemies took away from the battle. Also, the monotony of the enemies left me wanting. During one area of the game, in the Sandsea, I had a chain of 164, I wasn't trying to get chain points, either. No matter how good the battle system was designed, 164 of the same enemy, in a row, gets boring.  The license system seemed more like a dumbed down version of the sphere grid in FFX. I loved the sphere grid, wasn't so fond of this system. Obtaining the experience through battle to increase your abilities would have made this a success, requiring abilities to also be bought made it a failure. At level 20, Penelope had cleared the Magick section of the grid, although, her highest level magick that was of use was Cura...hardly an impressive skill.  The storyline was like riding a snail. Too many cut-scenes and not enough interesting developments. The gil distribution was down-right ridiculous. Leveling up for hours, exploring every nook-and-cranny of a dungeon, and still not having enough money to improve your weapons...there just wasn't a good balance. There needs to be a healthy dose of risk and reward to keep it interesting, in past games, leveling up was just as fun as progressing the story...it felt like a necessary chore in FFXII. For nearly every enemy I remember, you got 1 license point per kill. By a rough estimation, 1800 enemies would need killed to clear one section of the licensing system.  The last rant was the character classes, or lack of. Any character can be anything you want and carry any weapon you want (for a necessary price). While the openness can be good, it makes for rather boring characters and the excitement of getting new skills for a class is completely lost. After all, so what if Vaan gets that new axe when Basche is right behind (note: I mentioned a weapon...there are no special abilities unique to any character, either).  Between the lack of rewards, gil, ability increases with experience, and monotony of battles, I would not recommend this game. I put 20 hours into the game and completely lost interest midway through a hunt (the mini-games are bland and the rewards for completing a hunt are nothing to get excited about, comparable to defeating a difficult enemy in previous FF games). I believe you can make a decision as to whether you will enjoy this game with a rental. Naturally, another person may like everything I ranted on above. Like any FF game, you hate the learning curve from the previous for a few hours and then become addicted...I lost interest in the middle of the addiction-stage 
 I bought this book because I had heard of the author due to my knowledge of France and the French language.  (Also, I knew that his wife, Arielle Dombasle, was one of the most beautiful  women in France.  Although she is French, she was born in the USA to an American mother and she carries an American passport.)  I found the prose in the book somewhat rambling, disjointed, and seldom interesting, let alone entertaining.  The contents of the book just did not seem to have any real purpose or goal; it was mostly a random collection of thoughts and observations, many of which were seemingly pointless.  Perhaps it is unfair for me to say this, but this book just re-inforced my belief that one of the problems with France is that the country has too many so-called philosphers, of which BHL is one. 
 I absolutely love the Avonlea series that was on the Disney Channel.  I was very excited to learn that Disney was releasing the series in a complete season format.  Although the package does not indicate that it is closed captioned it is.  That was a must for me as I am deaf.  Unfortunately, the video quality is very poor and a LOT of editing was done in most of the episodes.  I would consider purchasing from Sullivan Entertainment, but their discs do not have closed captioning or even subtitles.  If you don't mind the editing, poor video quality or the sometimes out of sync audio, then you would like it very much 
 I have read a lot of Michael Crichton and thought it intelligent and interesting.  After just finishing "Travels" this afternoon, I have to admit that I hated it.  I know that this book was about his inner and outer travels in life in which he reaches self discovery, but in reality it is one of the most self obsessed books I have ever read.  He whines and complains and tries to find excuses for his bad behavior and his inability to have a meaningful relationship.  Instead of looking at the international travel (as little as he actually talks about it) as a great opportunity to learn about other cultures for who they are, he is continually belittling and condescending.  His only real self discovery is when he turns to self help and psychics so he can talk about how wonderful he is and how misunderstood he is.  For all his money and experiences he could have had the same attitude anywhere, one of ego centered self indulgences.  Nice try but highly frustrating and diary-ish.  He should have kept this one to himself 
 Here's what happens when a bunch of unstable dolts from the Old Country get together and smoke banana peels and fistfulls of catnip. And the chin-droolers who call this art are the same saps who blog angry entries about there not being a Criterion version of "Reefer Madness," their irony valve dried up like a used condom in the Tenderloin on a sunny day. So yeah, pass the granola and don your fruit stripe sarong, but I just gotta tell ya, if you're smoking anything through a pipe as morning is about to break like a rotten egg all over the sky, it's probably crack. What is this otherwise? Gut instinct tells me it's a concept album about a satanic astrophysician who collects wind-up chimes while journeying to the land at the bottom of the Sun with a wild pack of gnomes strapped to his back. See what I mean? I'd rather dig boogers out of my nostrils with a razor-riddled shoehorn than listen to this one more time 
 Never mind's that it's pretty stupid - "John Tucker Must Die," like a lot of movies about high-schoolers, actually hates high school and just about everybody in it, and by extension, American kids; it's the kind of movie that, if parents caught an hour of it, would make them think less of their children for watching it, and to a fearsome extent, pretending to live it out. Early in the movie one character, a cheerleader, remarks about stealing her mother's estrogen pills: "Well, guys use steroids to build their pecs." That estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader's breasts is laughable, but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids - considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them - that could be most casual, sickening line of the year.   But it is what to expect from Hollywood screenwriters in their 30s who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild, girlie comedy - not unlike those fabulous "Laguna Beach" hacks who use insidious, and I mean insidious, editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched, again and again in the sloppiest manner, to the previous line of dialogue. "JTMD" asks us to believe that the title character (Jesse Metcalf) simultaneously dates three women (Ashanti, Sophia Bush, Arielle Kebbel) without them knowing it, is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town, owns a great car, stays in four-star hotels for high-school basketball road games, and my personal favorite, owns and drives a yacht. He and his brother have no parents to speak of.  Neither do the three girls, unless you count the cheerleader's mom reference. One of them (Bush) is an avowed 17-year-old vegan vixen, however. And when they discover they've all been dating the same guy in gym class, they get in a brawl and are not suspended, but sent to a 23-minute detention without a teacher.  Is this a satire, as "JTMD" bills itself? An edgy comedy? A smarter, cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline, in this post-Columbine world, for looking at each other funny, and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news. A cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete, but, say head of the drama club. A cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase, ultra-hardened brat girls, but sweet, emotional, sunny girls. A cleverer film would know a dark comedy, if that's what "JTMD" intends to be, can't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven.  Instead we have a fourth, "smart" girl (Brittany Snow) is introduced as the girls' grand, "Taming of the Shrew" plan to woo John and eventually stomp his heart. This angel, of course, begins to fall for John, who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy, which are, if we follow our MTV, two of the trinity (the last being sheer, drop-dead cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have, preferably brown) that makes up male desirability. Director Betty Thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to. Ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick, adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading, in an empowered, open society that has a foreign Hindu woman as CEO of Pepsi, represents the canopy of female of achievement. Go figure - you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid!  We've been pounding this Earth for years now. Why do teens and young women still trail along, lapping it up? There is no real wit in the movie that you can't see from some third-rate comic being fed lines on a VH1 program, no style, no genuine attitude. It's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty, young, rotten, unidealistic America most interested in getting tail, getting even and throwing s-uh-weet hoopty-rah parties. It is not immoral so much as it blank, a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic, most involving self-debasement of young bodies. What fools Hollywood sees our children to be, wants them to be. What numb, donkey fools. If you need more proof, Jenny McCarthy has been cast as the voice of reason - and she's borderline believable.   Ya know, so much ugliness is spewed about "Islamofascists," these manaical, stoneaged fiends who apparently can't tell you the sky is blue, spending most of their time taping martyr videos, finding Mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life. Consider, though, that one of the more recognizable items in Muslim countries is the satellite dish . A year from now, this thing's on a movie channel, and well, whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the American decline into shame, they've got it. Not because it's absent morals, but humanity - the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be.  
 Most people who quote Kierkegaard aren't familiar with his works in detail.  From a neo-constructivist perspective, the man is the greatest pornographer of his generation.  Most especially, I find all his talk about  "love" sickening.  What about the other fundamental emotions-  irony, tragedy, and viscosity?  Who buys this carp 
 I purchased this album for my kids (6 + 4.5) and just assumed that it was child friendly because it is Kidz Bop and kids sing on the album.  BUT I was wrong.  On the last song #18 Don't forget about us.  Half way through the song there is a line that was never altered for kids.  The line states "b**tch don't do it like me, she'll never be MC.."   Um hello!  This is KIDZ BOP..... Needless to say I tried to contact the company but to no avail....  Buyers be aware.... For the sake of the kids that are growing up way too fast...  
 The ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book.  It was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real Ludlum books 
 I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another. 
 I would write in more detail but I would refer everyone to the review "Flawed thesis and tunnel vision: interesting dishonesty."  This is the second book I've read from Armstrong and her goal seems to be the same:  History comes second to placing Islam/Muslims/Arabs in a positive light.  
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 If you are a complete business novice, this may be useful.  I was hoping to have a reference guide for my bookshelf so I can look up issues that I may face as a small-business owner.  But I felt the topics covered were shallow and uninformative.  I returned the book 
 Although the book is written by two Black authors it's not much different than Emily Post. I'd give it three stars but so much missing. For example it could have discussed how to visit other churches. AME Zion is not the same as a Baptist chuch and neither one is the same as a COGIC church. I would have loved to found out what to bring to a baby dedication...it's not the same as a baptism. There are so many events that are unique to Black life it's too bad the book doesn't address the etiquette required for them 
 Once again a conservative minister with traditional views thinks women needed a man to not only think FOR them...but to tell us what WE are actually thinking!!!!! If you want to know what wives wish their husbands knew, ask a real wife. If you want to enhance your traditional conservative marriage, this book is for you. Otherwise, not good for modern couple 
 I gave this one one star, but it might rate two. If you're looking for a chatty, rambling, disorganized treatise on gender and biology, and think that you can really learn something valuable about humans from the animal kingdom, then this book is for you.  I bought this book because I thought it was going to be about the brain.  It's more about gender behavior.  You're left to draw you own concllusions about what's going on in the brain.  There's gotta be a better book than this 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 I agree with everything Anne M. Koch had to say about this book in her earlier review of it, and I'd apply it to Dodman's other books, too. I add these thoughts as well:  Once you've read two of Dodman's cases, you know the formula: "This was the presenting case--this is what I pessimistically taught the owners to do with their pet--and THIS is the drug I prescribed!" His books are stultifying once you've learned the key behavioral factors he identifies (which are useful in and of themselves).  Does Dodman care at all about these animals, beyond their usefulness as subjects for his drug experimentation and potential appearance in the next repetitive volume he grinds out? His persona is reptilian and ambitious once you get past the stilted expressions of his caring about the creatures he so readily medicates out of their gourds.   Even more bothersome to me is his failure to draw any ethical line when it comes to dogs suffering radical predation/aggression. Were Dodman a bit less thrilled with his own pharmaceutical heroics, he might realize there's a time to say, "Either find another home for this dog or put him down, or I can't be responsible if he devours your baby or maims your friends." No, Dr. Dodman: when such a dog is 90% better on drugs, I'm not risking that 10% around my loved ones, thank you!  I think that his volumes might have a limited usefulness to practicing veterinarians, if they can get past their author's false-ringing tone, and if you know little to nothing about dogs and cats, you'll pick up a few key bits of information--over and over again.  I'm in search of better authors on the subject, and I plan to read the books recommended by Koch in her review-she seems more knowledgable and human than the author at point here is 
 I purchased this for my daughter since I had already had purchased one for myself.  The pictures are clear and crisp.  If I had to buy another I would purchase the same 
 We read this book for a graduate class on teaching other cultures. While I was disappointed at the lack of practical applications of the book, it did help to open my eyes to the idea of White Dominance. There are factors of a white-dominated culture that are invisible to us whites, and Howard does a good job of bringing those to light.  Much of the book is comprised of personal narratives, about Howard living in an economically-recessed area while attending Yale. It was then that he began to question his assumptions about racism, and the rest is history.  I do, however, believe that he is using this book as a way of marketing his REACH center, which is an organization that trains teachers in cultural awareness, and also designs curricula for schools.  Overall, this book is a good place to start when considering the implications and hazards of teaching other cultures, but just the book by itself does little to enlighten 
 ... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.  To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another "blockbuster" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending 
 I had purchased this book about a year ago...and I have YET to make something edible from it! I have tried multiple chicken, beef, and vegetable dishes, and they were all awful! Last night, in fact, I made the Oriental Beef and Broccoli on page 163, and it BURNED. I know...I didn't think you COULD burn something in the crock pot without a serious effort to do just that...but it happened! I had it set for 8 hours on LOW, as the recipie states 8 to 10 hours on low, and 6 hours into the cooking process, I checked it... and the meat was burned! I was shocked! What a waste and a dissapointment! We ended up eating frozen pizza, and the book has ended up in the trash! My crock pot gets used at least once a week, so it wasn't that, and I double checked the recipie. It wasn't end user error....Better homes and Gardens just dosn't check their recipies any more! I am very dissapointed with this waste of paper they call a cookbook...and it's not the first time I have been dissapointed by Better Homes and Gardens product. Don't even get me started on the toaster oven I bought on their reccommendation.....They have gone to He** in a handbasket...Shape up, BH&G!! You are losing customers with your poor quality!!:( 
 Briefly looking through this book you can quickly see that it is not a technical design book.   It does a very nice job at praising various popular magazines, and it does highlight fundamental design practices within magazine design.  It is a good overview book. It is also a good book to see many images of successful magazines without having to hunt down various magazines.  However, the problem is the book does not going into the technical process of magazine layout. Magazine layout IS a very technical process that most books don't explain. There is much about the grid - it is extremely important and very under estimated. It is also more simple than most people would think. There is also much about magazine layout and structure this book will not cover. Also about the whole process, from layout to print. There are a MILLION questions and problems that pop-up while designing a magazine. Many considerations and variables that vary. This book does not bring up any of those.  Can you design a magazine after reading this book? No. Can you evaluate and understand magazines better after reading this book? Yes. Can you get a feeling for what magazine design is about after reading this book? Yes. Can you get some great ideas out of this book? Yes. ...you can also get them by looking through quality magazines 
 It's tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how BAD it truly is, but Ms. Grafton has somehow earned a following, and as I've said before, there is something for everyone out there. After all, some people (not a majority) actually voted for George W. Bush, on purpose! I think this level of mystery fluff is for them.  Rather than spoil the nutty climax (I have worked in hospitals for years, so I ain't buying it) I will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words: "...life is one big, savage joke; not funny ha-ha, but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began."  I became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began (where did they go to kindergarten?) that I almost missed the rest of the chapter 
 I've flipped through this book countless times while browsing my local library's knitting section and I'm always turned off by the boring and frequently ugly designs and color schemes. This author apparently has never met an earth tone she didn't like. How about adding a little sparkle to some of those muddier colors with some jewel tones? I can't speak for technique having never used the book. My advise is to browse through it at the library or book store before purchasing it here. Put it this way--it never inspires me enough to check it out of the library---for free! Of course, I'm not a big fan of her mother's book, Knitting Without Tears (I can imagine the gasps of outrage since she seems to be a knitting godess) and wish I'd spent my money on something less boring. I've had Knitting Without Tears for nearly four years now and have yet to use it for anything. It's just wasting space on my shelf. Since this book is a much bigger investment be wise and borrow a copy before buying 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 Maiden is my favorite metal band of all time but this is missing too many of their greats. My suggestion is to just buy all of their studio albums then make your own greatest hits CD. The best albums are Numbers of the Beast, Piece of Mind, and Powerslave. Buy those for an introduction to the band and if you like it then pick up the rest. Although some of their later CD's got poor reviews you can still find a nugget or two on each.   Below is a history of their studio albums in order, to the left I have rated them from 1-5 stars:  5 Iron Maiden (1980) Paul Di'anno on vocals (more of a punk/blues style but he still rocked.) This debut album has some beautifull melodic pieces that are timeless. Very different album than the rest. Buy it just for Phantom of the Opera (one of the best metal pieces ever.)   4.5 Killers (1981) Paul Di'anno vocals 5 The Number of the Beast (1982) Bruce Dickinson's first vocals (He is a God.) This is a must buy! 5 Piece of Mind (1983) Wow! 5 Powerslave (1984) Mind blowing material...another must buy! 4 Somewhere in Time (1986) Things start getting lighter here.  4 Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988) I like this one better than Somewhere in Time. 3.5 No Prayer for the Dying (1990)  3.5 Fear of the Dark (1992) 2.5 The X factor (1995) Dickinson out, Blaze Bayley on vocals 3 Virtual XI (1998) Blaze Bayley on vocals 4 Brave New World (2000) Dickinson returns on vocals, nice return. 4.5 Dance of Death (2003) Must buy! Paschendale and DOD are great.  5 A matter of Life and Death (2006) Most solid overall album since Powerslave. Great stuff!  I also highly recommend their live albums "Live after death" recorded in Long Beach and "Rock in Rio" recorded in front of 250,000 Brazilians. Iron Maiden is well regarded as one of the best live bands of all time and you will quickly see why if you listen to these CD's. As one critic put it "If you are in a band you don't want to follow Iron Maiden." The Rio set has some of the slower songs such as Blood Brothers but they sound great live. The Live after Death features their early and harder classics. Both of them together showcase a great balance of their career.       
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 I loved The Godfather, and looked forward to reading this one. I soon discovered that this author comes no where near the classic. The writing is just not as good, and it didn't seem to follow the story as I know it. Also, it was a bit anacronistic -it is supposed to be set in 1955, but one of the characters mentions Viagra!! I think that was when I stopped reading. So, I'm going to stick to the original. 
 I used my remote all of about 8 times before it stopped working.  Even with the proprietary dongle inserted into a controller slot you cannot control this thing with a controller, you must use the remote control.  When you take the dongle out with a DVD in, a screen will come up telling to reinsert, so if either the dongle or the remote get slightly injured or malfunction, then you've just wasted thirty bucks.  I feel quite ripped off.  With the low cost of DVDs nowadays, it's a MUCH better idea to buy a standalone IMHO, you can get a good progressive scan for about $30 or $40, which comes out to about the same price.  As a side, it is also EXTREMELY annoying that you can't turn on, or off the device with the remote, you must go up to box to do it yourself, especially annoying if you just want to watch a DVD in your bed and crash afterwards.    All in all the value proposition offered by this product is very low considering the similarly priced alternatives 
 I can't believe this guy actually writes books about dogs for a living.  As other reviewers mention, he needlessly kills Orson after Orson bites three people.  The first bite seemed to be just a case of Orson being a little too rambunctious, but the second and third bites were caused by people reaching into a fenced area to pet Orson, without getting the owner's permission or without knowing the dog first.  Orson was killed because people are stupid.  Besides, if you think your dog might bite someone, might not you put up a BEWARE OF DOG sign before he bites more people?  Although this guy took Orson to pet "psychics" and "shamans" to try to fix him, it never occurred to him to try take some precautions around his farm to keep Orson from biting people after the first bite.  Much like Marley and Me, this is a book about a really stupid dog owner who cashes in on his dog's suffering and tries to justify it as making a tough choice for a dog he loves.  Don't believe it.    If you want to read a truly charming and heartwarming book about dogs, try "The Dogs Who Found Me."   
 Could someone please help me get some use out of this device.  I work in Kuwait as a DOD Contractor on Camp Arifjan.  This is my first player and I cannot return it to Tigerdirect. (They ship overseas but no returns.) I bought this player to enjoy movies while I travel.  It is too big for just music.  Every website I try that works with Creative Zen Vision W to download movies is not allowed to download in Kuwait.  Nothing!!! So I tried to add one of my DVD's to it and no, it doesn't work.  I tried software to convert it so it will go on my player.  And no! Please someone help me! I admit I am new to this and work 12.5 hrs 6 days a week so my time is limited to mess with this thing.  THANK YOU for any advice.  :)  
 I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one 
 Although this catalogue is stunning in its photography, graphics and presentation, I was surprised and dismayed by its content. If the article in Chapter 6 entitled "Stumbles and Pitfalls in the Search of Viking  America" is an example of the level of scholarly rigor, the authors  have stumbled painfully with misrepresentations, unsubstantiated innuendos,  blatant contradictions and a stream of factual errors. The pitfall, it  seems, is an agenda established by the editors to discount the slightest  consideration of evidence of any kind for Norse contact south of the  Canadian boarder, reinforced by gratuitous remarks throughout the catalogue  (we wonder by whom) denigrating pre-contact research. In all, this  publication is an embarrassment to standards of American scholarship and a  perverse use of taxpayers' money. The Smithsonian should be ashamed of  itself!  Suzanne Carlson, Edgecomb, Main 
 I read many historical and theological books.  This book lacks organization and it lacks any academic references.  The vast majority of historical and/or theological books include bibliographies and footnotes or endnotes.  This book had none of these.  Further, as the book is an accumulation of essays and excerpts from many other sources, I would expect a bit of an explanation for each of the authors - especially the more obscure ones.  Now, that being said, I do agree with much of what this book purports, and have read other books that touch on many of the items addressed by this book.  However, I think this book is incomplete, and is not representative of the genre nor does it live up to its title 
 Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot 
 From about the second page of this book, I was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it. The characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another. Add to that the stereotypical characters (the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys, the women are all "large-assed" or fat with the exception of Ella).  And the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb, not to mention kind of repulsive (I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but Tuck's descriptions are completely banal).  Oh wait, there's more. The Spanish is ATROCIOUS. It's hard to believe that Tuck had a translator for this book. It's pretty clear that whoever copy edited it neither reads nor writes nor speaks Spanish. Half the names are grammatically incorrect. Many of the words are just plain wrong ("vita" means life in Italian, not Spanish, for starters). I felt embarrased for the author. Does she know that her book is full of errors? The one word that comes to mind when thinking about this book is: SHALLOW. I sincerely hope that readers don't mistake this book for historical fiction. The author clearly knows little about Paraguay and its people and history, and clearly doesn't care, from her superficial treatment of it. 
 Should this book be titled The New Scratchboard? It really is'nt what I would say scratchboard is about, although it has plenty of nice color artwork done on claybord it only has 20 pages on scratchbord and thats using the authors technique of value scratching not high contract scratchboard that I like. (personally I dont think his stuff is that great) If you looking for a book on scratchboard dont get this. Buy Mastering the Art of Scratchboard. If your looking for a book on claybord then be my guest and buy it 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 The most interesting thing about this book is that the author feels no pressure to legitimize his assertion that there is something special about 30 seconds. Because his background is in the field of television entertainment, (never to be confused with communications), he finds significance in the length of television commercials, which frequently run 30 seconds. That this is done for financial reasons, not attention-span reasons, has evaded him completely. HTGYPAI3SOL is just another in the endless chain of How To books penned by individuals struggling with delusions of expertise, whose only skill is self-promotion, that package the obvious and resell it to the gullible. Readers who find anything in this slim and overpriced tome even remotely surprising or counter-intuitive are advised to probe deeper into the self-help section of the bookstore for volumes on Shoe-Tying For Beginners, The ABCs Of Writing Your Name, and Gravity - It's Not Just A Good Idea, It's The Law.  
 It quickly became clear that the author felt too strongly and personally about this subject to be clearheaded about it. It suffers from poor reporting, awkward writing, and negligent editing. The way she repeatedly harps on how the kids in the book may be gifted and even enjoying life but they are "geeky" or "not cool" is juvenile and ridiculous. She should have written a memoir first.  It's too bad because this is a book that is begging to be written properly. The subject is very timely. 
 Having enjoyed other Ripley stories, I found all the cental characters in the book unlikeley, and discriptions of Ripley and his relationships irritating and was glad to finish the book, by skimming the pages towards the finish.  
 As an Amazon reviewer, I have dedicated my account to providing a level-headed review of anything that I have listened to that is worth reviewing. More often than not, I will point out the good and the bad for each album as to give to the minds of those who haven't heard it yet unbiased information as to decide for themselves whether or not to purchase it. However, I believe I have actually found an album that has no redeeming value anywhere on it. Chingy never was very talented, whether lyrically or flow-wise, but at least his first album had a couple enjoyable beats that pushed the limit of synthesizer use, helping make some of the song more listenable. But his follow-up is...well, how can I describe while also being nice...unmitigated crap. There, I used a big word in an attempt to be nice. Even if you're into the whole "cash-money-hoes" pop rap that's been overtaking the mainstream, this album won't do a thing for you. Some of these types of rapper at least incorporate some of their young "hood" life experiences to make it their own, but Chingy, other than his nasaly, thick accent, does absolutely nothing to place his trademark on this album. All that this album offers is more generic "I'm rich so I'll flaunt it until you puke" crap. Worse, the beats are unoriginal and do nothing to add to the "music". I don't even know if you can call this music, as it does not follow any of the guidelines that music sets down. Chingy has no talent and no amount of argument is going to prove otherwise. I can't believe I once even listened to this guy. It makes me sick that people like this guy are the ones that get paid millions of dollars and sell multi-platinum records for showing absolutely no sign of musicianship at all. He and all his fellow rappers should be sent back to the hood and be forced to study music theory for the rest of their lives. And for the love of God, Chingy, LEARN TO SPELL! You're not impressing anyone with your unintelligent songs like "Wurr Da Git It Gurlz At" and "Fall'N". I don't see what's so hard about spelling those right. Here's a short lesson: "WHERE ARE THE GET IT GIRLS?" and "FALLING", My god, you can't even spell simple words right.  Bottom line: there is no reason why you should buy this album. Like I said, even if you absolutely adore rap and hip hop in all its forms, you most likely will not find any songs on here worth listening to even once. You'll just find it covered in dust in your closet years from now and retch with disgust that you actually dropped full CD price for such a worthless waste of materials. For rap that actually warrants more than one listen, try Busdriver or Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, who actually have lyrical prowess and interesting flow. For good music in general, listen to great metal bands like Children of Bodom and Blind Guardian, and maybe even some classical composers like Dvorak and Beethoven. Those artists have/had more creative talent in a single atom than Chingy has in his whole body. This CD gets no points whatsoever. I would also give 0 stars to it, but Amazon has not yet realized that 1/5 means that there's at least a shred of quality on it, but this album doesn't even deserve it.  0/1 
 Even though I have no issue with the seller (they shipeed really quickly) I'll tell you definitely don't waste your money on this garbage.  I bought a pair for a trip to Tahoe recently, and before I even made it to the FIRST RUN the zipper split.  Got it back together, and held for the rest of the day.  Second day, I hadn't even made it up the first ski lift and the zipper broke again, permanently this time.  Nothing like skiing with your bibs open all day.  Upon returning to the lodge, I found out one of the seams on the inside had split, too.  Promptly threw the pants out after that, no sense in re-packing them for another cross country flight!  Spend your money elsewhere instead of throwing it away on these pants 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help 
 The buttons on the remote, although many, are not useful.  The only button we use (to advance or back up slides in a presentation) was difficult to use, poorly located, unreliable.  NOT a good selectio 
 Metal (especially thrash) has seen many members come and go since its inception many years ago, guitarists, drummers, bassist's all of these creating a different kind of sound for the band they leave and enter. Singers are basically the key factor to a bands overall sound, so when the singer leaves and is replaced it is VITAL that the replacement be just as good if not identical to the prior one. Many times this works, but most of the time not. Helloween is actually a good example, they actually improved with the dismisal of Micheal Kiske, and the replacement or Andy Deris. Kiske proved nothing more than to be a Geoff Tate clone, even though he did posess a powerful vocal range. Then take Judas Priest, although you can never replace the classicness of Rob Halfords voice it can be mimiced and was quite well by Tim "the ripper" Owens. I found these two bands to be about the only two bands "i can think of" who have successfully replaced singers and carried on with somewhat great success. Bad examples, Black Sabbath who went through half a dozen singers then finally called it quits after Tony Iommi carried the name around and drug it through the dirt for 15 more years after Ozzy's departure. Now to Sepultura, when Max left back in 96 or so "god knows why" to form Soulfly i was very distrot in that i knew for certain they would try to replace him and it just wouldn't work. Well my greatest fears came true with the release of Against, a basically horid album with hardly any sound elements of Sepultura to be found. Only the tribal drumming and singing of tribal wore remained, but was deadened by Deriks voice. What happen to the band that put out Beneath the Remains, Arise, and Chao's A.D. They died unfortunately and will never return, only in the form of SOULFLY, which now with the release of Dark Ages Max has finally given rebirth to Thrash metal again, with a taste of Soulfly still in it.   Sepultura hang it up, give the band name to Max he deserves it way more than you, you have taken a perfectly good name and drug it through the dirt now for over ten years. Change the God For Saken name already and maybe you'll get back on a major label, or continue and lose more and more fans every year. This just doen'st work 
 This book is terrible!  It gives different definitions for the same term several times in the first few chapters.  Why doesn't it just give one coherent, comprehensive definition for each word?!! The concepts are broken up and presented helter-skelter, so reading this book is like working a tedious jigsaw puzzle. Then it includes lots of problems at the end of each chapter, but there is no answer key, and the Solutions Manual is only available to teachers.  Do they think that my professor is too lazy or too stupid to make up his own tests? (Hint to oblivious writers/editors: a textbook is useless if students cannot practice working problems and check the answers on their own.  This is not third grade, and my professor is not a babysitter!)  I bought the workbook (which contains practice tests) separately, but I still don't have the answers to the problems at the end of the chapters. I will speak to the department heads at my college and beg them to switch publishers next semester 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 opened the sealed DVD case and Get Shorty was inside and not the Usual Suspects.   I sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement.  I got a credit, I think.  Not sure.  I would rather just have the correct movie 
 This book is an incredible waste of time and money.  Only a few of the stories are even mildly amusing.  They all seem to be the type of event where "you needed to be there.&quot 
 If you liked the movie Syriana, you won't like the book or the poorly written autobiography by Robert Baer.  It's a rehash of 9/11 failures ...there is nothing new here, not even a good description of CIA tradecraft. The close is typical:  "Are we not hitting the target we can rather than the target we should 
 The animation was cool, but the storyline lacked a whole lot of substance. This movie needs a lot more background information for it to be interesting. Also, remember the speeder chase through the forest in Star  Wars: Return of the Jedi? Well, expect to hear those very sound bytes for  the alien fighters in this movie.. 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic 
 The author examines Inka and Mayan myths using a variety of tools, and many, many words.  To the first myth he applies the theories in Hamlets Mill to explain why the Foxes tail is black and pinpoint AD 650 as the rise of warfare in the Andes.  From here it's mostly downhill.  The author then drags us through his own internal mental processes of doubt and disbelief as he looks at other myths.  Through this long process he forcefully and unnecessarily brings up many biases such as there is no proof that a matriarchal society ever existed anywhere in the world.  Period.  He returns to the subject of matriarchal disbelief many times calling it a big 'red flag'.  He leads us through his admitted internal stubborness of this and many other issues.  Although I believe the author is correct in his assocation with the Fox's tail being black being a celestial event ala Hamlets Mills, he spends so many words looking at other myths from a plethora of angles that you are forced into a single conclusion.  That no one outside of a culture has any clue at what a given myth really means.  The entire book is like running naked through the forest yelling out conclusions about myths which rightly are interpreted only by their creators.  At one point in the discussion of 'finding father' he claims that the Andean man lacked a true heart with the ability to love while he was primarily a hunter within a matrilinear horticultural society.  Andean man only gained his heart and full ability to love when the culture changed to fully agriculture and he had to stay at home with the wife and kids.  Give me a break.  To any Andean person alive this is rubbish.  What kinds of conclusions and judgements can we make living outside the cultural box.  It is this kind of subtle talk that is a jaguars hair short of prejudice and racism.  Ultimately, although if you like reading from the 'academic' view, this book does lead you through enough alleys to make you feel like the author knows what he is talking about, ultimately it fails from it's biases and from being rooted in a combination of sexism and western scientific dogma.  If the author wanted to really understand the Andean mind then he would have had to undergo a process of breaking open his head and surrendering to the mystery of myth reather than trying to break open the myths using the rational mind.  Myth is mythic.  A view which ultimately escapes the author.  It might be worth it to take this book on if you have a university paper to write.  It will certainly scintillate your professor being of the same vocabulary and possibly biases.  But if you are looking to expanding your understanding of the Inka or Andean cultures from a spiritual or mythic perspective then look elsewhere.  Get yourself to South America, Peru, spend time with the shamans.  Then you can learn what myth is really about.  And how it lives today 
 Uh, I'm not sure I agree a hundred percent with your detective work, there, Greil.   If he truly wanted to present and comprehensive view of what his subtitle purports, that is, American myths archetypes and how they inform and are presented by Rock and Roll, why is the scope of this book so narrow? The artists he focuses on are a motley crew. Elvis, Robert Johnson sure- but Randy Newman? The Band, but not Dylan? Harmonica Frank, but no Chuck Berry? Berry's oeuvre itself is a perfect microcosm of 20th century American Mythos. Speaking of myth, why is Pilgram's Progress invoked as a metaphor for The Band, but Faust isn't referenced at all in the Robert Johnson chapter. America is nothing if not Faustian. This book is 40 percent Rock-Geek trivia, and 60 percent pure ponderous speculation. Marcus occasionally drifts into a fugue and wanders far away from his (musical) subject, several times in the Elvis section whereupon he suddenly remembers what he was supposed to be writing about and tries vainly to shoehorn all of his speculations together. I think Marcus is a fine writer (we would not entertain his notions for a second if he wasn't), and this book certainly has its moments, but on the whole it does not nearly live up to its hype. He has done better, in The Old, Weird America, dealing with the same themes and sticking to one musical subject (Dylan's Basement Tapes). 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 I bought this book and also Last Night based upon the gushing reviews you see above.  Who are they kidding? The main character is a cad.  It is far from "a tour de force" in erotic anything. His short stories in Last Night are only marginally better. Your time is better spent with other authors 
 apart from the well known singles the rest are  orchestated rubbish if  you are looking for  a bit  of rock  and rythem leave  this  one  alon 
 There are arm full of books in the market place that are better than this book, and yes some that are worse.  I'm surprised that the authors have a radio show.  Just goes to show you if you're persistent, you can obtain anything in life.  There are many authors who would make better radio show hosts, but the activities that they participate in are probably more renumerative.  The book would appeal most to those who for lacks of funds or mindset wish to do all the rehab work themselves and will only acquire a house once every year or two.  There are much better ways to make money as a real estate investor of homes and make your time more productive.  To that end the book provides some useful guidance on contracting with a contractor, if you elect to go that route, and tips for cleaning up a house.  Is the book worth it's price?  Depends on your mindset and how much you value the money to buy the book.  My suggestion would be to read a library's book first, and then decide if you want to buy it 
 This is the sadest little book ever! After reading Will Clower's "Fat Fallacy", and becoming a big fan of "eating for pleasure", I wanted to find more books on the topic and came across the reviews for "The Martini Diet", in which one of the readers compared this book to Mr. Clower's- immediately stirring my interest. But unlike the "Fat Fallacy"- written in an intelligent, constantly providing scientific facts- sort of way, which convinced me to adopt the life style in the first place, Jennifer Sander's book is written on a middle/highschool level and I found it close to unbearable to read. If I haden't read the "Fat Fallacy" first, I'd have no idea what this woman was talking about and would assume that this was something she and her "big-big" friends (Her words, not mine!) came up with while sipping on Martini's.  If she's not constantly talking about "putting Martini glasses down" to engage in other activities(is she an alcoholic?), she contradicts and repeats herself over and over again: -Like stating that she enjoys the Slim Fast Shakes and breakfast bars, which substitue for a REAL breakfast. So much about a "real food diet"!  - On page 49 she even advertises calorie counting (and I thought that that was excactely what we didn't want to do anymore!) - And what about her statement, that "real grown ups" are never seen in public drinking anything, including bottled water because that would be tacky!? Hello?  Just to mention a few disturbing things.  I absolutely agree with the outline of this diet, but it couldn't have been advertised any worse than this! "Gin" Sanders seems to want to morphe herself so desperately into Jacky O. and Co., that you can't help but wonder what happened to this woman during her "heftier" day's, to make her completely want to become somebody else. If you are not interested in turning yourself into a "wannabe" socialite with a few simple tricks from "Gin", but would like a great- new approach to nutrition, explained with adult reasoning, then I suggest you read William Clower's "Fat Fallacy" instead!  This could have really been a great book... : 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 All I want to know is if the book in questiob is an accurate translation of the Koran (Quran, whatever). There is way too much arguing and posturing in these reviews about the Koran in general and not enough discussion about the individual translation itself 
 Despite the reviews, I don't connect with this book. It had nothing memorable. Sorry, it's going to get donated to the local library 
 This book is written exclusively from a pro-Israeli stand-point.  The author is a former Israeli ambassador to the UN and, as such, spends chapter after chapter trying to exonerate Israeli foreign policy which has often been condemned by several UN Security Council resolutions.  However, this book is a useful guide to showing you how politicians create a 'camouflage of confusion' and how the many UN splinter organisations have consistently aided genocide in Africa by handing out free guns.  Not really essential reading - and has no information at all about the founding of the UN, the Meditation Temple in the basement and the UN's links to the Alice Bailey Lucis (Lucifer Publishing) organisation 
 Not much has changed from the original diet.  You might be able to stay on it for a week and loose some water pounds, but you will not be able to survive on this one. Look for something else if you want to loose weight that will stay off 
 This is not a George A. Romero project. Directed and written by Ken Wiederman. Film contains profane language, gross bloody effects.   Thom Matthews returns as a different character, "Joey", James Karen returns as a different character, "Ed", Jonathan Terry returns as "Glover", Allan Trautman returns as "Tarman". Brian Peck returns as 5 different zombies, "Pussface", "Thriller", "Jaw", "Eye-Pop" and the zombie on the car roof.   A truck that is traveling across a bridge is carrying pressurized cases that contain cadavers.  One case falls off the truck and ends up in the water.  A group of kids find the case and triggers the gas inside that spreads across the cemetary.  The living dead return.   Also in the cast: Thor van Lingen, Dana Ashbrook, Mitch Pileggi. DVD only contains audio commentary and theatrical trailer 
 This is a horrible book written from a very nasty point of view. Basically, this is a systematic dismantling of everything sacred about Judaism - to the point where the author actually uses the sacred name of God in the book. Obviously, the author knew that his use of the name of God would deeply insult those devoutly Jewish, and just as obviously, the author did not care if he insults deeply held beliefs.  It's important to understand that this is coming from a man that feels that what is now Israel will soon no longer exist as the Jewish homeland - and he demonstrates absolutely no concern for that, either.  No concern for the basics of the Jewish religion, disdain for the Jewish homeland, and disdain for the future of the Jewish race. Anti-religion, Anti-Judaism, Anti-Israel. There's a word for that 
 We received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago (I was registered at Babies R Us).  My first child used it for a little over 2 years.  My second child has used it for nearly 2 years.  Neither child is big (in fact, one is rather petite). Even though the mattress was not abused, it cracked and ripped in numerous places.  I'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from Kolkraft.  I don't recommend this mattress. 
 Unless you are a complete novice to the subject, I would avoid this book. These so called 'gurus' merely give some of the ideas they have had for making procedural textures, and suggest what you could potentially do. Then they go into great detail on subjects like beveling a brick texture! Not useful. You WONT find explict texture recipes. You WONT learn how to code a texture engine (like Bryce uses for example). There is little you cant find on the web. If this book were [less expensive] I might be singing a different tune.. 
 When I saw this toy it looked like it would be so cute so I bought it for my baby.  Coming from Sassy, I thought it must be good.  Boy, was I disappointed.  You pull the string, put in the water and, it just sits there with the string going back in.  I thought we had a broken one until I read the other reviews and they all said the same thing.  Sassy should be ashamed putting their good name on such a poor product.  It really isn't even worth 1 star, but you can't give 0 stars.  If I could I would definitely give this loser of a toy 0 stars.  How disappointing coming from a company who has won toy awards on so many other toys 
 I bought this wok 6 months ago. I seasoned it very well and started to use it. But I noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when I cooked the dish with a lot of sauce. It meant I couldn't use it for steaming. When I made a fried rice, I had a hard time to clean it and re-season it. Most Chinese use a wok to cook everything, so I expected I could do that, too. But I was wrong. This wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry. That's all 
 I bought this book based on a review in Saveur.  It did not give me the information that I wanted and at $50+, I thought that it was very overpriced 
 This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting 
 Have U heard "let's go" from from this poser who thinks nobody has ever heard crazy train from ozzy osbourne? He completely killed a really cool part of that song and replaced a really hardcore song with somthing dumb like "Let's Go!!!!!" and other dumb rhymes. I never understood why rap did this. Think of me as white heavy metal trash if U want but at least heavy metal people play guitar and rappers use mics and rap about things nobody cares about. Heavy metal people are experienced with their fingers while rappers like Trick Daddy use their palms (think about that for a minute) now if U like trick daddy I have no problem with that. I would also have no problem if they did a cover for crazy train from ozzy but I get pissed if they start ripping off giutar riffs from him. I'm more of a heavy metal type of guy but I like SOME rap. Listen to Eminem, Ludicris, or Lil'John if U wanna hear some rap with original Ideas 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 I thought this book with very average... It just seemed to be the some kind of work though out the book 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 we didn't love this album as much as latin playground and others. it is a lullaby cd, we know, but it was way too mellow for us. 
 Al Franken is intelligent, witty and informed and for those of us who were already sick to death of Rush Limbaugh's dreck when this book was released, it was a guilty pleasure. Yes, we knew the taunting was childish but on the other hand, we also knew Rush needed to be taken down a peg or two. Reason and facts weren't having the least effect, so why not hit him where it hurt?  However, with the benefit of hindsight, maybe it's not so funny to publicly humiliate people for their physical appearence. Especially when it results in the target trying so desperately to drop pounds, he becomes addicted to drugs (hey, fellow liberals, if we have enough compassion to support needle-exchange programs for street junkies, why do some of us have bumper stickers mocking R. L. for HIS drug problems?)  Neither is it very funny to contemplate the further degeneration of public discourse in this country. How can we complain about Ann Coulter and insist the Right renounce her unless we renouce the childish name-callers in our own ranks?  And so, although I agree with Franken's other, truly serious political critiques of the pundits, on my bookshelf, this particular title has worn out its welcome 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 This movie was not entertaining at all, bad script, etc

 We bought this book for our 3 year old daughter for a flight as a "convenient" way to carry a bunch of puzzles in one book. She liked the book well enough, but there is one major problem: the puzzles that are embedded in the pages of the book don't stay in the book. As a result, if you finish one puzzle and turn the page to go to the next puzzle, it is pretty likely that the just-completed puzzle from the previous page will spill all over the place. This flaw makes the book completely useless almost immediately (at least in its book form). The only real remedy is to put the puzzle pieces in containers once you are done, which basically defeats the point of the book format.  The puzzles are nice and pretty, but be prepared for frustration when the completed puzzles don't stay in the book 
 This book is not for the novice interested in learning about the basics of telescope buying.  It is a very hard read as it is not organized nicely, has pages and pages of technical jargon, tons of unnecessary repetition...      They describe certain telescope features and don't explain why one feature might be better over another.  They just mention the features.  The book contains a lot of reviews on outdated equipment and nothing on the latest telescopes.  It did not provide a simple outline of the various features one should look for in a telescope -- perhaps aperture, focal length, mm diameter, etc.  -- this is what I was looking for.  I found more informative concise information on Yahoo! Answers for free.   I decided to purchase another book that was meant for the newbie and explains in simple terms what one should look for and has a lot of great photos and diagrams.  It does not contain technical terms adfinitum that would only help a professional astronomer.  The better book is entitled "A Simple Guide to Telescopes, Spotting Scopes, and Binoculars" and you can purchase on Amazon for $10.  This book is helpful for not only telescope selecting for the novice, but also for set up, etc for after you get the telescope.  Emphasis on the word simple!   Thank goodness I decided to check it out at my local Borders, as I was about to buy it sight unseen on Amazon due to the great reviews above.  It would have been a waste of money 
 I read this book over thirty years ago when I was an architecture student at the University of Oregon and had a dificult time undestanding the text.  I tried to read it again about ten years after graduation and couldn't develop any excitement or enthusiasm for the book.  It is very difficult to understand and is written in somewhat tedious style 
 I think Hemingway wanted to do two things:  (1) critique certain aspects of how WWII was fought (particularly the politicalization of battle plans); and (2) pay homage to his beloved Venice.  To do so, he crafted a fairly thin story about an old soldier who finds himself in one last love with a girl a fraction of his age.  The plot (to the extent there is one) and the relationship between the characters would probably make a nice short story.  The bulk of the book is taken up by tourist writing about Venice (locales, architecture, food, markets, layout, and, of course, the canals) and a journalist's rants about US generals in WWII.  Diehard Hemingway fans will find some jewels worth the read; others should stay away 
 I bought this adapter thinking I would be able to print documents from my pocketpc. I installed the adapter to my 6300 hp printer only to find out that you can only print images. I was not completely satisfied with this adapter 
 Pros: 1. This book is considered by some one of the key books in this field 2. It has some great observations on how to detects "lies" within charts 3. General advices are sound (if a bit obvious): don't use irrelevant marks, shades and hatches; do plot information... 4. Some interesting information on history of graphs  Cons: 1. The book is dated. This is the 2001 edition but I am not sure how much updating has happened since the late 1980s.  2. Some proposed techniques are peculiar; the author goes way too far into removing what he considers redundant lines: he has a new box plot and a new way to do bar charts that (although contain the same information from a mathematical point of view) will just loose the audience focus, since the audience will spend attention into puzzling out the new graph 3. The book is extremely idiosyncratic on what types of charts it covers, and you are likely not find anything of interest to you besides the general advice  
 I love building bricks.  I love Batman.  I HATE THIS SET.  This was the most disappointing "kit" I've ever had the misfortune to purchase.  I complained directly to the manufacturer about their ill-fitting bricks, but naturally never heard back.  Most of the bricks fit together loosely causing them to pop off at the most inopportune times.  The flat base pieces are made of poor plastic and too thin, so unless you are on a very flat very hard surface (and sometimes even then), the bricks pop off.  The floor on the "upper level" was completely warped because the bricks were so poorly shaped and fit together so badly.  Thank goodness LEGO got the Batman license and built a decent kit.  It is too bad about the this set, the building plan was nice and the design was nice.  But it wasn't worth the frustration nor the price.  Not even having the mini-figs was worth it.    And what's up with the freaking LAVENDER bricks anyway?  I don't recall that being a Batcave colour.  UGH UGH UGH 
 I was extremely disappointed in this book. Mr. Shackelford didn't know whether to write it as a biography of George C. Thomas or as a summary to George C. Thomas' book "Golf Architecture in America: Its Strategy and Construction". Neither was written well enough to finish 5 chapters 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great 
 ....if it wasn't for Chancellor Williams' "herrenvolk" mentality, and his obvious distorting of African/Middle Eastern history to make it seem as if all African history was nothing more than a protracted struggle between black and white. This is what ultimately damns what, on the surface, appears to be a brilliant and well-researched book on African history.   One glaring example of shoddy reasoning is Professor Williams' supposition that "white power centers" existed in Northern Egypt about 2800 B.C. This alone is highly improbable, given that virtually all of Egypt at that time, and most of the Levant(ie, Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, etc.) was either black or brown. Another thing Williams blindly overlooked was that many of the Ancient Egyptian sculuptures were later altered by insecure white anthropologists who could not accept the mere idea of Egypt being an African civilization--something which continues to this very day.   Finally, Chancellor Williams can't bring himself to admit the simple truth as to why ancient African civilizations collapsed: they collapsed for the same reason all the others did--they overextended themselves, grew decadent, and left themselves wide open for invaders. Williams insists that the blacks were too trusting of outside forces. But the same could be said about the Romans trusting the barbarians(whom they allowed into their armies)who eventually destroyed Rome. At bottom, he really seems to believe that Africans are too childlike to build great empires and institutions--in other words, he is projecting his anxieties as an Afro-American onto African issues, and in this he fails miserably 
 "Amanda Miranda" is by far the worst book I have ever read.  They must have abridged all the exciting, good parts out of the story!  Peck isn't my favorite author, but this plot sounded very intriguing, but I was only able to read a few pages a day.  The Titanic was not introduced until the end of the novel, and when it was mentioned, it was brief.  I do not recommend 
 i adore le creuset, but this tea kettle was a monumental disappointment. as other reviewers have noted, it rusted within months of purchasing it. (however, i admittedly had no problems with burns from the handle or removing the whistle to pour.) i can't imagine what a person would need to do in order to prevent the rusting, aside from never actually using the kettle. i was seriously let down by this purchase, since it looked so beautiful but ended up being so useless 
 There is no doubt that Sun Tzu's little book on war is an enduring classic, but this little edition is ridiculous.  There is a reason it is so cheap.  It is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction.  If you are going to take the trouble to buy and read Sun Tzu's masterpiece, you should at least get a version that explains what Sun Tzu was really talking about.  The best translation is by Giles, as is this, but in the original Giles translation there is a running commentary, between the lines by Giles and several classical Chinese scholars, explaining both the context and meaning of the text.  It is virtually impossible to really appreciate what Sun Tzu was talking about without the background that the original Giles translation provides.  There are several editions of the full Giles edition available.  Any of them are a better choice than this little stripped down version.  The best is the Special Edition that contains two copies of the translation - one stripped down version, like this edition, in addition to the Chinese text and the fully annotated version that is twice as long as the unexplained translation.  Sometimes you really do get what you pay for 
 I think I'm one of the biggest Hiatt fans ever and  I used to consider him God of songwriting. With this one he povd to me he's human. I just don't think it's up there with "Bring the Family" or "Stolen Moments" or "Walk On", or Beneath This Gruff Exterior." Sounds like he may have originally decided not to release these but changed his mind. Maybe it's me but I don't get it 
 The programs are not really "ready-to-run." They are not "Ready-to-use." Programming is required, because there are bugs in html documents and scripts that must be corrected. The book is a good resource of information for people who want to study and learn and troubleshoot and learn Perl, because it is possible to get the scripts to work if the troubleshooter does not give up until they get things to work satisfactorily. I believe that it is practically impossible for a person to use these scripts without having some experience with Perl and CGI and HTML. The book has a lot of good explanations of code, which I find helpful and useful. I can't blame anyone for selling the book in the way it is sold. Salesmen sell the book. Programmers who successfully learn, don't give up when things don't work easily. This is book for beginning programmers 
 Come on!  I thought they had erroneously mailed out CZs!  These earrings dont have even the faintest tinge of blue in them!  What a RIP!   The sterling silver was nice and well-constructed but i purchased these earrings on the strength of what i thought were the dazzling blue topaz stones.  Quite a disappointment!  I had to buy an emergency back-up Christmas gift for my best friend 
 Being a Mortgage Broker, when I saw the title I thought it would be a good book for my industry - wrong! This is the second Guerilla series book I have purchased and I have been disappointed with both. The title mentioned more about the business of Mortgage Brokers than the text of the book. The author put a few Mortgage Buzz words in the text but it had no real meat for the Mortgage business or any business. If someone finds this book a good buy then they should not be in business for themselves since the content is just simple common sense. Also, the big turn off was when the author compared Marketing to 'Good Sex.' That statement alone shows he has no class! Instead of putting the book on my bookshelf, I put it where it belongs - the trash!  
 I can't believe TBN has promoted this book. Read the Publisher's Book Description above. It's totally ridiculous.   What are the advantages to loneliness???  Why does God use an enemy to refine you???  How can a handicap or disability offer you the most dazzling reward in heaven???  God gives you thorns for your benefit???  Instead of believing the information in this book, read the negative reviews below and take them into consideration. [... 
  Strengths:handful of decent tracks, talent is present, cd has clean sounding guitars, vocals and bass drums, every now and then it almost gets exciting...for a few seconds  Weaknesses: they don't seem to know how to change their sound at all, almost no creativity, music is boring and not energetic at all, most tracks are long and exhausting to listen to, could have been much better than what it is    I'm surprised who P.U. is categorized with. Noone else thinks they sound a tad bit akin to TOOL?  I could be wrong...all I've heard from TOOL in forever is their radio stuff, but this sounds alot more TOOL-ish to me than, oh say, Taproot-ish or Endo-ish.  Hard 'n Heavy bass chords, clearly distinctive guitar rhythms and pounding bass drums, that sound just like TOOL. Vocals have that high pitch sound thats too one keyed and too soft for me. All songs seem to run at virtually one pace..SLOW. The music gets boring.   I can't hear where they've broken any real ground or added anything cool, catchy, or different.  I'm just not digging this disc as much as I think I should be.     With a cheap boombox you're likely to miss alot of the low end that makes the music strong and enticing.  So without good speakers, the music sounds even more wimpy and even more boring than with a good surround system.  
 Well, while I enjoyed the biochemical explanations for sugar addiction, the 'diet' itself is like so many out there now.  Basically, stay away from sugars and white foods (except for that potato)..  It also seems to embody some of the glycemic index theories..  All in all, I wasn't impressed..  It's helped so many people though, it might be worth a shot for someone else.. GOOD LUCK 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 James is a great literary virtuoso, in certain ways the most sophisticated and complex America has had. His intricate intelligence is complemented by an unequaled descriptive power, and a mastery of language, second to none. How difficult then to come across the passage which ruins this book for me. This is James description of the immigrant Jews on the East Side.It is the observation of the sterile aristrocatic owner of Anglo-Saxon civilization who looks with contempt and horror at the poor swarming sweatshop crowd threatening to steal his private inheritance from him.  
 This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation.  If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress & strain book its more poorly written then the Marks 
 Yikes - who edited this thing?  While there are a few gems, I felt like I was reading a book with half the pages missing.  Clearly, material is taken from his other books and recycled for this one, but he might have checked to make sure that all the referenced graphs and text were actually in the book!  Numerous times I was flipping around to try to find a chart he was talking about, only to find that it wasn't anywhere in the book.  You get the impression quickly that this was churned out to scrape in some extra dough.  Larry's writing style is "conversational" - and that's a charitable way to describe it.  Despite all these flaws, there is some good info, and some good trading ideas, but I can't recommend it 
 Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time 
 Nietzsche was destined to be cursed by the vapidity and foolishness of those closest to him: first his sister, and next his translator, Walter Kaufmann, who singlehandedly stifled all creative and thoughtful work on Nietzsche in English for much of the twentieth century, when it would seem to have been just getting started. Not only were his translations one-dimensional, not only was his view of Nietzsche fairly warped and condescending; but he spent most of his time not translating Neitzsche or doing thoughtful work in the community but rather destroying the careers of others by publishing nasty reviews which, due to his iron grip on the american philosophical societies, made it fairly impossible to publish on nietzsche if one hadn't earned his prior approval by kissing up. He was, in short, the very portrait of the arrogant know-it-all professor. To see this, one only has to look to his translations of Nietzsche, where he comments derisively on the works of others; chides Nietzsche for his views on women, his poetic capability, and his philosophical outlooks; and refers more to his own footnotes than the text in question. It becomes quickly apparent that W. Kaufmann sees himself as vastly more important than Nietzsche; even his biographical note at the end of the texts is almost twice as long as Nietzsche's!  Here he is no different; his view of Nietzsche is perhaps slightly more developed than some, but is not outstanding in any way. Besides, this is less about Nietzsche than about Kaufmann anyhow. The "Kaufmann freeze" has broken, and other people are publishing about Nietzche; it may be hard to find good books about him, but rest assured that this isn't one of them. Briefly: forget about this one, and also avoid any of Mr. Kaufmann's translations. Try Hollingdale, who isn't much better in the translation department, but at least doesn't detract from the text through arrogant footnotes 
 I bought this for private pilot training. All of the switches, throttles, etc. are easy to set up and use. The problem is the quality of materials makes this unsuitable for training for piloting a real plane. After a short time the internal friction builds up so that it is impossible to get the yoke to center. This means that it is not possible to get a plane trimmed out and the pilot must make constant attitude adjustments. Also because of the friction a firm shove is required to initiate any movement. This technique transferred to a real plane causes a very abrupt application of force to the flight controls. Needless to say this makes practicing IFR just about impossible.  After the problem developed I contacted CH to troubleshoot it. They were very helpful and eventually agreed to exchange it. Within a few hours of flying with the replacement it developed the same problems. This is despite the polishing and lubrication recommended by the support staff.  If you are looking for a yoke to add realism to your flight training steer clear of this one as it will cause you to develop bad habits that will be expensive to break. And after all, weren't we SIMing to save money in the first place 
 I used his book as an MBA student 15 or so years ago.  Now as an adjunct professor, I am using this newest edition in my undergraduate classes. Although my observation may be biased, the book is a bit too encyclopedic,  a bit superficial in coverage, and fails to excite the students.  I wish it  were more up-to-date 
 Strawson's work reigned as the supreme example of Kant scholarship in English for several decades.  It might have been ok for its time, but it offers the typical idealist interpretation of Kant, and attempts to separate the contents of Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic from his Transcendental Analytic, arguing that only the contents of the latter have merit.  But the two sections play the similar roles in Kant's revolution and to wholly reject the aesthetic and not the analytic is, I believe, impossible.  Strawson does not even take seriously the arguments of Kant's aesthetic, probably because he is English and the English always get nervous around the aesthetic.  While one may still have to deal with this book if writing a paper on Kant, as Strawson is still held in fairly high regard, I would recommend this book only for one who is not familiar with the traditional idealist interpretations of Kant 
 For those of you who are not sure where you stand on the big-retailer issue, this piece of pure elitist "culture of fear" rabidly pro-collectivist propaganda is junk. This DVD is Wal-mart haters sewing together the most bald-faced microscopic disinformation in order inspire people to despise a corporation that has the power to restrict union organizing in their business. That's the whole enchilada for these spoil-sports. If you have any concern about issues relating to power, economic and social consequences, and the direction retail marketing is going, DO NOT expect to get much out of this but some Hitlerian diatribe about the Evil Empire of Wal-Mart. Try reading some good articles or watching other documentaries, but if you're just too lazy to think for yourself and want to be sucked into this caricature of corporate hatred, by all means go over to the darkside, Luke. I wish I could give this zero stars.  
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 I found no mention of Harry Ferguson, the Ford-Ferguson tractor(perhaps the most significant agricultural tractor of the Twentieth Century), or subsequent tractor work by Ford.  There was no mention of Dearborn Motors, nor its significance to the Company 
 I actually threw this book away,something I almost never do. This author drags together every half-baked story anyone has ever written down and presents it,with no evidence or eyewitness statements, as it is.Do you believe that a pack of evil ghost-dogs prowl highway 666 in New Mexico? Neither do I-but they're here in this "collection." Anyone reading this review could have written a book that would be at least as good as this one. Don't spend any money on this book! Try to find a good book instea 
 I only bought the cd at first because of the song I can't help falling in love with you, so I figured I'd like all of the others because I liked all there other hits but boy was I in for a real suprise! Besides the songs "I can't help falling in love with you" and "Floorfiller" the cd is not worth listening to in my opinion. I thouht some of the songs had no meanings. I defenitely recommend their earlier music and cds instead of this one 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 Folks, being Celtic is a matter of genes and heritage.  You cannot become a "Celtic Woman" simply by performing the rites offered in this book.  Sure, there's a paradigm associated with the Celts (which is such a broad term anyway since you're talking about various different peoples), and I suppose anyone could adapt them.  But being Celtic is a question of having Celtic blood, and neither this book nor any other can give you that.  I really feel like this book cheapens my own Celtic heritage at the same time it insults other heritages by somehow implying there's something more to being Celtic.  I would love to see a book extolling a heritage other than Celtic just to run against the pop Celtic interest grain.  Shame 
 perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull  something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched 
 Lowney's book -- from its cover and font to its subject material and format as a series of mini-biographies -- is a less elegant, less informed and less nuanced rip-off of Professor Maria Rosa Menocal's masterful "Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain." Anyone interested in medieval Spanish history would do better to read Menocal's gripping account than to waste their time on a wanna-be 
 From the reviews I read for this book when it first came out I expected an updated, nostalgic, autumn-golden memoir of young love in Paris.  I was  excited to hear that Dyer is a young up-and-coming British writer.  Throw  in what were described as original sex and trendy drug use and you could  not be faulted for expecting something very good.  Sadly, Paris Trance is  poorly written, boring, pretentiously unfunny.  Why does Alex hold Luke up  as a model?  Why does Dyer so awkwardly go about making Alex to be the  narrator?  Why does the reader not care about any of the characters in the  least?  I can answer this last question: the girls are nothing but pretty,  the boys are nothing but competitive and uncharmingly pop-cultured.  These  are among the most forgettable, interchangeable characters I have read of  since Ellis's "The Rules of Attraction".  Please--I would like  very much to read about sex- and drug-fiend, clever slackers living in  Paris in the 90's; but not if the author is awkward and uninterested in his  character 
 I had a problem with the Veronica doll sold by MEGA Toyland (ASIN: B00081FP3I) but the seller addressed my concerns immediately and much to my satisfaction. I have deleted my original comment, but can't revise my star rating--would if I could 
 This book is basically Marxist view of art, and what art is intended to accomplish.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It does help you to examine your assumptions and beliefs a bit, and that's one of the things an education is supposed to do.  The book repeatedly hammers the idea that art serves the purposes of the ruling class.  This is beat upon to the point of tediousness.  There is also a chapter that can be summarized as "art serves the purposes of powerful men by trivializing women and encouraging them to think of themselves as an object d'art for the viewing pleasure of others.  Oddly enough, the book didn't really return to this them in the final essay when it talked about the visual image in advertising.  That's an arena where visual imagery is used to play on the insecurities of everyone, but especially women, to convince them that they are flawed and need __(fill in the name of a product)____ to be happy and respected and glamorous. Speaking of which, one of the more interesting points in the book (even though I believe it is flat wrong) is the discussion of the rise of "glamor" as a desirable trait.  I found the book interesting, and it irritated me, but only in a good way--By making me think about my views.  But it really is written from the perspectives of a trendy liberal from the early 1970s.  Instead of closing with a powerful message summarizing some important aspect of art that we have been taught, the authors even use the final paragraph of the last essay to point out that capitalism exploits the masses and coerces them to ignore their own best interest(that's literally what it says!).  Probably worth reading, but not a high priority.  The Penguin edition is compact and affordable, but the B&W images are so small that much of the value of the work is lost--You can't see details of the art being reproduced 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
 While this book contains a ton of useful information (especially the charts showing which processor families support which instructions), I found so many gramatical, organizational, and techinical errors in the book that they became too distracting.  After getting through the first half of the book, I skimmed around through the rest...and everywhere I happened to look I found glaring problems.  The text contains many incomplete sentences, confusing attempts at humor (due to poor sentence structure), and serious grammar problems that a good copy editor should have caught immediately.  Likewise, I found alot of inconsistencies and errors in the code, explanations, and diagrams...which a technical editor should have caught.  When a book is not properly copy-edited or technically-edited, the problem lies with the publisher, not the author.  (This is the first and last book I will attempt to read from this publisher.)  Bottom line: If you already know Intel assembly language, and you have the time, patience, and knowledge to recognize and wade through all the errors, you might glean some good information.  But I can't, in good conscience, recommend this book 
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone and her walking tapes and have several for variety and love them all.  I recently bought this book based on the reviews of others but found it really was geared to those who are new to walking.  There is one small chapter for advanced walkers but it doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know if you currently do Leslie's tapes.   If you are just starting out walking, you may find this book contains some good information and inspirational stories.  But if you are already a "Walker", your money is better spent on a new Leslie Sansone DVD to make sure you have variety in your workouts and a subscription to Weight Watchers magazine, which will provide you with more insight into healthier eating habits.    I returned my book.  Sorry Leslie 
 I am very disappointed with this book.  I wanted a book to help me keep track of my daily intake of calories. Not pages and pages full of the author's opinions and tips on weight loss. A lot of the items listed are commercial food that by law have to carry nutrition info anyway. I am prefectly capable of reading a nutrition lable for calories, I don't need the added step of finding it in this book, which doesn't have a very good order of listing items in my opinion. Instead I recommend "The Doctors Pocket Calorie, Fat & Carbohydrate Counter: 2002 Edition, Plus 101 Fast Food Chains and Restaurants" and "The Complete and Up-to-Date Fat Book: A Guide to the Fat, Calories and Fat Percentages in Your Food" - both of which are available from amazon 
 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.    Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.    Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film.   In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)  The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better 
 I'd have put no star if I could have.  This thing is made from cheap plastic that's not sturdy enough to support a kitten, much less a full grown cat.  The rings came loose upon sitting it down onto the toilet so there couldn't be any stages unless it were taped together.  The setup won't fit onto a standard toilet without modification.  Do not buy this unless you want to know what "design flaw" really means 
 the product seems like a great idea, however, it did not come with attatchments for an i-pod, which is the reason we bought it.  Called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number.  it has just been a hassle 
 This book managed to come in second in this year's Hugo Award voting. Unfortunately, I don't think it deserved that kind of recognition.   This is another entry in the 'hard' sf sub-genre, one that has as its major point of focus the Vingeian Singularity, which assumes that technological progress is on an exponential slope that will eventually lead to a complete breakdown of civilization as we know it, being replaced by artificial intelligences that will consume all the physical resources of the solar system.   The book is episodic (which follows naturally from its roots as separate short stories), covering three generations of one family as the world moves from pre-Singularity to post-Singularity times. It also leads to the major problem with this book: none of the characters are particularly well-defined or explored in depth. Many of their reactions to the events of this book do not ring true, do not ring human. Of course, Stross may have been trying for exactly that impression - humans of this future world are not the humans of today. While it is interesting in an intellectual way to see how a normal human will morph into something of much greater thinking capacity as he becomes more and more wired up to external computers, and eventually can become a disembodied intelligence, what is lacking here is any emotional basis for believing in these people. The scientific ideas run rampant over the story and characters, and some of those ideas will be difficult for someone not versed in computer-speak to assimilate and understand, leading to some confusion about just what is really happening at various points in the story.   The 'solution' Stross offers to the Fermi paradox (if there are lots of aliens out there, where are they? Why have we seen no evidence of them or had any communications from them?) is plausible, and a lot of the ideas he so casually tosses around are intriguing and stimulating. But without a solid story and strong characters to work within this idea space, the book comes across as more of a scientific treatise than a novel.   --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat 
 I like what this guy is trying to do: like Tolkien, he is trying to revive a world of epic meaning. Unlike Tolkien, he writes with constant dramatics, thinly disguised allegories as characters, and frequently rambles on for dozens of pages on completely irrelevant points. The author's asides contain plenty of great information, as does the character of Merlyn, but this is often painful to read from the sheer repetition of technique and emotion.. 
 Although this book had good information, it had to be ferreted out.  It did not give enough day to day living details.  I seldom go to cocktail parties, eat caviar or have business lunchs. The restaurants we patronize do not have reservations, most of the time do not have chefs. The author came across as a spoiled socialite with a 6 figure income and no children.  She had a snit because the hostess did not cater to her every whim. She demonstrated rude behavior that I would not have tolerated. I would have prefered she give me good information on common occurances on living the 'real' life 
 This book belongs in the genre of what I call Grouch Books: extensive  laments about costs and consequences of technology, but with no attempts at  syntheses or solutions. At every turn, the author paints a "no  exit" vision of the internet: if it's freewheeling and unregulated,  it's "chaotic" and "disorganized"; where it's  centralized, it is overbearing and freedom-robbing.   The author makes it  seem as though the people concerned with hardware and software development  are thoughtless, greedy, naive, or some combination. Any hint of  libertarian ideals in the shakers and movers of digital culture is  dismissed by Rochlin as naive and illusory, and every tendency of this  culture is, in his vision, toward loss of humanity and the replacement of  art with artifice.   This book is single-track thinking at its worst. And  to anyone who has experienced the benefits of digital culture and design,  the complaining tone grows tiresome and monotonous.  On those very rare  occasions when he begrudges some possible benefits of the internet,  Rochelin immediately qualifies them out of existence. The increased  information made available by the internet, for example, is seen as all  right for those who use it for "social development," but not for  "conversation and entertainment" -- as if mere conversation had  nothing to do with social development.   If readers want to read about the  costs and consequences of technology, they would be far better advised to  go through a book such as Neil Postman's *Technopoly.* While just as grim  in his assessment of the current state of affairs, Postman has a much  greater range, and at least has the intellectual stamina to propose a  solution 
 My friend's mother bought him this cd recently and he hasn't talked to her since 
 Bits of Beatles,Zappa, Queen, (Herman's Hermits ?), may be laudable  in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator. Elfman's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal Musical pieces, they have fairly banal, repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music. Has the creepy competence of a Dave Grusin album. If you like that you'll be OK here 
 Earings are too big...no way of knowing they were as big as they are...nothing i will wear.... 
 There are at least two false assertions in this book: 1) There was no anti-semitism in Egypt prior to the rise of the Zionist movement, and 2) Egyptian Jews were not Zionists.    Regarding anti-semitism in Egypt: In fact, until the European power dominated Egypt, both Jews and Christians had inferior status, known as the Dhimmi status.  They had to pay special taxes (guizyah), they had to wear special dresses that identify them, etc.  So both Jews and Christians were humiliated.  With the coming of the nation-state age, Christians and Jews were still legally discriminated against.  For instance, Moslem men can marry Christian and Jewish women, but Christian and Jewish men may not marry MOslem women.  Jews were denied citizenship.  Today, the Jews left, but Christians are being killed and harassed.  As a Christian, I feel estranged from my own society.  Two better books on the subject are: Chirstians vs. Muslims in Modern Egypt by Sana'a Hassan, a Muslim, and The Jews of Islam by Bernard Lewis (Chapter 1 talks about Islam and Other Religions).    Regarding 2), the Zionism of Egyptian Jews, Jews in Egypt supported the idea of  a Jewish state like Jews all over the world, even if they did not choose to live there.  Not only Jews were Zionists, but many Christians in Egypt were sympathetic to Israel.  My own family was very happy to see Israel win in 1967.  Why should every country in the Middle East be Arab and Muslim?  The author's leftist leanings motivated him to distort the reality of the situation for Egyptian Jews.  He tried to blame Israel, but even Christians who are anti-Israel are persecuted in Egypt.  The complaints by other reviewers that he did not mention the incarcerations and torture of all Egyptian Jewish men between 1967 and 1970 is indeed a denial of their suffering 
 I am considering opening my own spa and I bought this book based on the publisher's review that it has everything to "build and operate a profitable business". I have an MBA and 10 years of management consulting experience, so for me this book was a collection of the common sense business basics and generalities instead of the spa operations insights. It is definitely not worth its price ($69). For those who are in my shoes, I would suggest to buy one of the business publications available from the ISPA or learn industry trends from www.hfdspa.com and many SPA publications 
 I bought this book with a lot of expectations.  However it turned out to be 200 pages of anecdotes, which lose their charm after the first twenty pages.  If I had followed the carnal rule of reading the contents list  before buying a book, I would not have made this mistake.  I admit there is  a good book scattered somewhere in those 200 pages.  But the author has to  pay better attention to the organization.  He could recount the same  anecdotes under a thematic framework based on the principles of marketing 
 Where to begin?  There is no significant character development.  As soon as you are getting to know a character, the perspective will switch to one of the other many, many characters.  However, this could be a blessing-- considering that all of the characters are infinitely boring, unlikeable and depressing anyway.  This dreck was so INCREDIBLY BORING that I began skimming about half way though.  And then I just gave up and skipped to the end.   This book was so horribly dull, I just had to see if the author could salvage it with an unexpected, creative conclusion.  No such luck.  The author tries to push the envelope and go for shock value...but fails miserably.  Instead, the ending was...well, just plain gross and stupid.  Save your money and bang your head repeatedly into a brick wall, instead of purchasing this boring dreck.  You will achieve the same feeling as if you just read the entire book 
 I have spent this weekend trying to establish the boundaries of this system. The first attempt took a little while however we placed the flags as instructed. Fitted the collar to the dog & went outside for the 1st training session. I found it very hard to hear the beeping once the collar was on my dog however I soon realised that even before we were within 2 feet of the flags she was being shocked. I felt terrible. we took the collar off and realised that the boundaries had changed. The instructions say that it can fluctuate however we were never able to get it to beep in the same place twice. Sometimes we would get one beep & it would just stop. We tried to place the transmitter in three different locations today and each gave poor results. There were areas between flags placed 6 feet apart that we never heard a beep and could just keep on walking. I am more than willing to spend the time training my dog but I could not even set the boundaries. We changed the height of the transmitter, moved our car out of the way, moved anything we felt that may be affecting it without success. I am sorry but it did not work well for me. I will be returning the system 
 Twitchell makes some valid points about consumerism--if you can plod through this "hard" read with a dictionary at your side.  I disagree with his view that we middle-aged folks of today have selectively  forgotten how important consumption was for us.  Contrary  to his opinion,  I believe that we were not consumed by such materialism as the youth are  today.  It is quite a different "triumph of stuff" today.  What a  shame that we must give identity to ourselves through the things we  purchase.  Give me Elaine St. James and her book, Simplify Your Life 
 First off, I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Secondly, I have not actually read the book.  However, I have studied many religions including other Christian religions, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism.  Also I have read the excerpts from this book provided on the main website.  That gave me enough information to know that most of the information is false or has been twisted to provide a pejorative view point on the church.  As far as I can tell the book doesn't mention the fact that the children are being taught strong moral values like honesty and chastity.  These are attributes that seem to be lost in most of the world today.  Now this does not mean that members of the church are perfect and that they don't make mistakes but at least they are trying.  Moreover, there is no sign, in the excerpts, that all of the humanitarian work that the members of the church and the church itself does every year is ever mentioned.  Well of course not we wouldn't dare paint a real picture of the church if it makes it look better than what he may believe it is.    Here is a quote from the excerpts "Over sixty thousand fully-trained, adequately financed and prepared Mormon missionaries are serving in all parts of the United States and in over 124 countries around the world."  I was one of these supposedly "fully-trained" and "adequately financed" and "prepared" missionaries.  I don't know what the author considers "fully-trained" and "prepared" but I know that I would not have considered myself fully-trained.  I served as a missionary in Mexico.  I arrived there after 8 weeks of language and teaching training.  Being a linguist I also know that 8 weeks is hardly enough time to learn a foreign language let alone teaching skills.  And the reason that the missionaries are "adequately financed" is because many of them save up money for years or their parents provide the money for the missionary.  In cases where the family is not able to provide the money for the missionary to serve then members of the local congregation also can choose to help.  So what this really comes down to is if you want to know about any religious group or any other organization why do you go to someone who is obviously biased against it.  For example, when I wanted to know about Catholicism I went to my Catholic friends.  Same thing with Lutherans, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims and Jews.  If you want to know the truth about something go to those people that actually know.    If you want to know about Mormonism talk to a Mormon.  You shouldn't feel any pressure to become a member of the church yourself.  But you can learn and decide for yourself if the church is a good thing or a bad thing.  As a final note I know that many people who are not members of the LDS church are happy when their children make friends with kids who are members of the LDS church.  Because more often than not those children have higher moral values than many other kids in this day and time 
 I was really disappointed with this book.  It was syrup-y sweet and too perfect, as another review said.  I was really looking forward to reading this one after finishing the first one, which was GREAT.  I hope Sisterchicks in Mexico is better! 
 Taken from the premise that this book will likely just be picked up by fans who already know much of the Floyd story, I'm puzzled about what the author was trying to achieve.  There's no real revelations here, nothing that hasn't been said or published before.  In fact, looking at the sources he draws from, it's primarily a collection of previously published works and even a few DVD's!  My - what strenuous research Mr. Harris must have done.  Unless you're completely new to the material, this book will do very little to help further your knowledge of the subject.  It appears the author just cobbled together a bunch of already known facts and anicdotes in an attempt to make a few bucks off a great creative work that has stood the test of time.  Save your money 
 I was recommended Borges' works by one of his innumerable over-educated sycophants and I will never forget the tremendous time I wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life's work (when I should have been writing my dissertation). Each time I read one of his pedantic, mediocre peices of short fiction, I was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that I would like other examples of his work if I continued reading since "all of his stories are so unique." I found the exact opposite to be true. One story after another about mazes, mirrors, mystical mathematical formulas and books, books, books. The ideas were transperant, the language boring in the extreme. His poetry is trite. Who needs this? Borges reads like a petulant graduate student at University of Chicago who failed repeatedly to get his/her short fiction published in _The Atlantic Monthly_. Particularly among academics, literary elites and like people, many seem to cite Borges and worship his genius more than read him--and certaintly _no one_ reads him critically. I read most of his work, and I can tell you, outside of a few interesting turns of phrase, you'd be better off reading a Yale dissertation on the semiotics of self-superiority. People incessantly talk about how imaginative Borges is. The vast majority of popular SF and fantasy writers are more imaginative. Even many of the despicable magical realist "geniuses" make Borges look rather plain. Borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of Manhattan or Cambridge. If you're this kind of pompous fellow, you'll want to sleep every night with a portrait of Luis by your side and a series of mirrors, as it were, slowly attempting to seek some kind of trans-substantiation with this benighted old librarian. If you're the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters, enjoying nuanced use of language, and grasping subtle, daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter, run far, far away from Jorge Luis Borges. Even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews. The adulation of Borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among (those who think themselves) intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction. I think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment, relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams, and not an example of literary genius. In that sense, 30min spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work, and that's about as much attention as he deserves 
 The title of this book is a bit mis-leading. Many of the recipes call for many, many ingredients and the prep time is off. For example, one recipe says 20 min. prep time. But after you read it, it says to put something in the fridge for several hours. Making a lifestyle change like the Zone is hard enough without adding the frustration of buying sooo many ingredients and putting together complicated recipes. Plus, chicken and Salmon are about the only ingredients as meats. Where's pork or turkey 
 The writer's father and other ancestors may be good writers or storytellers, but Saira Shah certainly isn't. This book is a unstructured enumeration of detailed events during the writer's travels to her home country, but it lacks to give the larger picture the reader is looking for. Events or stories described in the book sometimes just span 1 sentence or 1 paragraph. Everytime I asked myself: "what was the point of writing this ?". I was also hoping to get a better insinght in the regions past and present, and the book almost failed completely. It's arrogant to call this book "memoirs" when the writer was barely 35 or 40 (my best guess) when she wrote it. There's just not enough substance and the reader leaves the book with a great hunger. The editors have done a bad job coaching the writer and editing the book 
 David Hockney's proposal is not borne out by facts.  If Hockney's  supposed "secret"   were a fact,  contemporary artists would easily match the masters of the Rennaissance in their drawings. Modern artists do not so easily match the masters,  nor do they use optics to accomplish drawings either.  Therefore,   Hockney's proposal is not based upon fact and he is not authoritative.  "Secret Knowledge" must join the stacks of  popular art books that will not long be remembered, unless it be for the notoriety of being terribly silly 
 Freak Kitchen has mastered every cliche of tasteless American guitar rock and added their own ridiculous Swedish twist. The solos are miles over the top and the lyrics are cartoonishly bad. I got my copy of this album for free, I think the price was just right. If you're intrigued by a Scandavian charicature of everything wrong with rock music in the States, download some songs but don't waste your money 
 I am used to making projects for which dimensions for the various pieces are provided.  Not only does the author fail to provide dimensions but he also fails to even talk about some of the pieces that are part of a given  project 
 People who claim they "loved" this gratuitous violence and debauchery-filled movie need to get a life and learn what a great movie is.  There is nothing redeeming or "important" about this movie.  It's just ugly.  
 This is a nicely designed walker and my baby likes it for the most part but we are not exactly satisfied by it for one reason. The front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels don't. Just like a car, it can only go forward and backward, but not sideways. Sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she can't push the walker that way because of the design, and she gets frustrated. If both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction, it would have had much greater mobility 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 The concept here is familiar childhood favourites of Connick's gussied up in new, sometimes wildly eccentric arrangements. On the plus side, it means you'll give a new ear to these oft-heard nuggets. On the minus side, only the most musically precocious child is likely to enjoy these versions...they're simply too far afield from what the tunes "sound like" for kids to key into. For the adults, the arrangements only occasionally really hit home. Too often, they're inventive but not a good fit for the songs they recast.  HIGHLIGHTS: MARY POPPINS' "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" is re-invented as a blast of Dixieland while Branford Marsalis' dancing soprano sax transports THE WIZARD OF OZ's "Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead". The lurching bass line propels a piano-only take on WILLIE WONKA's "Oompa Loompa". It's probably one of the more 'artistic' arrangements here that really works. On another set of WONKA tunes, Connick plays it pretty close to the vest but "Pure Imagination/Candy Man" makes for a nice medley.  LOWS: I love the sinister opening to OZ's "Over the Rainbow" but it doesn't deliver on what it promises: it quickly turns into a pale version of the Garland standard. One of OZ's weakest numbers "Merry Old Land of Oz" takes it on the chin as forced jovial laughter from Connick leads into a version that doesn't make it seem any more "deep". The overwrought take here reinforces the tune's general poverty.  BOTTOM LINE: In the end, there's more misses than hits so probably only Connick loyalists will love it. But if you're hoping to expose your kids to different musical genres, you may want to see if your local library has it and let them dip their toes into Dixieland and big band (and jazz via "Oompa Loompa") on their own level.   2 1/2 star 
 After reading this book, its obvious the Pope is very intelligent, has deep thoughts about religions place in the modern world, and has a huge vocabulary.  Unfortunately, it is not an easy book to understand and the audience does not seem to be the public at large but the intellectual religious upper echelon.  I had two types of experiences reading the book.  The first was that after repeatedly reading a section and trying to understand it, it was still not clear what the author was argueing for or against.  The other experience was that I felt that the message in some sections was hidden from the reader by the very wordy and "intellectual" style of the writing.  Its the type of experience where once a person understands what is being written, the response is "Oh, thats what he means.  Why didn't he just say so."  It reminded me of Professors who made things more difficult than they really were so he would appear brilliant.  Part of the problem may be that the book is a translation into English.  In any case, it did make me think 
 I watched this again on TMC last night.  Cary Grant was at his best, and I am a Joan Fontaine fan (when will "From This Day Forward" be available?)-- and Nigel Bruce could not have been better.    The photography was excellent and the editing nearly perfect.  But it escapes me why this film is considered a classic -- The Cary Grant character was a sleeze.  At the beginning, in the middle, and at the end.  There was not one point in the film, including the ending, where I didn't think he was a sleezeball and a shyster.    I kept wanting to yell at the glass:  Joan, dump this loser!  What's he going to do next, sell the family silver?  Sell your clothes?    Are women that dumb that they would hold on to this hustler?  And I won't even mention that "monkey face" thing.    And what was with the suit?  Is there one scene in the whole film where Cary doesn't appear wearing the same suit?  I thought I was watching a clothing store advertisement after a while.    There are Hitchcock films that I like (name any other one) and there are Cary Grant films that I like, but this one is lacking something major.  
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 This small book has a load of recommendations on the back cover. Yet, I find it unsatisfactory. It meanders in and out of the history of Islam and the Middle East, but loses focus on the way. Subjects are touch upon by conclusion and generalisation, but not really in depth. It is obvious, however, that Lewis knows quite a lot - but still some clear mistakes (or misformulations?) in chronology and factual events mar the picture, and damages the feeling of trust to how the subjects are handled. It has some really interesting insights in how the USA became the great enemy of the Islamists, and many details that makes the Middle East history much more detailed than it usually appears. Yet, in walking there and there, it lacks the solid foundation on facts and events present in the books of Serge Trifkovic, for example. And while Trifkovic writes with determination and feeling for the importance of facing the Islamist threat, Lewis merely mentions the threat, but then walks on to something else. And he doesn't really connect the issues of Holy War and Unholy Terror in depth as promised in the subtitle.  Bottom line: While interesting, I suggest to spend time and money on better books. They are out there 
 There are 3 or 4 good songs on this CD. If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow "Singin in the Bathtub" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively. My kids ask for that one all the time 
 A man who sets out to Walk however many hundred miles without proper preparation may not be too smart...however, there is no law against stupidity, so they say. But please, don't preach about the simplicity testimony when the first thing you do upon reaching the city is catch a cab. True plain Quakers live their lives with integrity, not with an agenda. As an aside, I couldn't help but feel sorry for his unregistered children when later in life they may want to claim citizenship...say to get a job... 
 As if obnoxious teenagers need more incentive to quote an inane and rather dull movie. The quotebook is not worth the money, simply put. There's nothing within that one cannot find by simply renting the movie or even looking it up on the Incredible Edible Internet (hint: head towards www.imdb.com). Before you buy this, stop for a moment and think to yourself: is this something I really need? Of course sometimes you just WANT, but if you already own the movie, or you have access to a library or computer, there's really no point in you wasting your hard-earned money on something so... Well. Pointless.  It's not particularly expensive, but there are plenty better products on which you can spend your 8 bucks 
 I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic "Diaper Depot" by Prince Lionheart 
 This book is a attempt to make people believe the "red menace" line of thinking, it never says that the soviet union was a defensive  nation, it's nuclear and conventional forces were all defensive, while nato and the US forces were always offensive one may look no futher then the american and soviet navy, the soviet navy was built as a defensive force using cruisers as the back bone of their navy with defensive missles, while our navy used aircraft carriers which we see today in the illegal invasion of iraq as tools to launch invasion from, Turkey 1961 anyone? yet another location was armed and placed within firing range of the soviet union, what was the soviet unions response to that threat? defensive missles placed in cuba to counter the aggressive american(and nato) approac 
 To the reviewer who thinks these are the originals, I "just want you to know" (lol) that this is NOT the original "Take It Easy On Me".  I have the first greatest hits album and it's awesome.  I've listened to those songs over and over and I can tell just from this sound clip that it's not the same version.  Listen to the phrasing and the way the singer holds the notes when he sings "I'm getting lost in the crowd" and it's TOTALLY obvious.  What a disgrace.    I also agree with the reviewer who commented on the change in the order...it was perfect before.  I knew the song "Cool Change" from when it was originally released, but hearing it on the first greatest hits album, as the finale, really made me appreciate what an amazing song it is...now my absolute favorite by LRB.  Again...disgraceful.  I will admit that I DO NOT own this CD, but I gave it a low rating because I am disgusted by what they've done to this great compilation.  And, from a completely different point of view, let's pretend that this re-release isn't a total debacle...let's say it was a fantastic re-do.  It's REALLY annoying to those of us who bought the original greatest hits to have one that would now be outdated...have the decency to rename it or, at the very least, change the album cover!!!  A wag of the finger to you! 
 Bad plot, bad acting, bad filming.  The surprise ending was a surprise because I had nearly terminated this boring, stupid film long before.  The actress playing the little girl was especially poor 
 I think I'm done with the Mrs. Murphy books.  This one was so bad I couldn't even finish it.  I actually threw it away.  It's time for the author to move on.  These characters have become downright boring 
 Really Really boring, don't think anyone should waste their time reading this garbage.  Horrible 
 It looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. Like a brand named leather wallet. But there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. Hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  There is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). There is no way to clip to the belt. Will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. Bought another handy synthetic case afterwards 
 In the ten minutes since I've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off.  More importantly, It can't handle large manuals as advertised.  (The reason I purchased this particular book holder)  My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter.  Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.  As for me, I'm off to read Amazon's return policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic 
 I thought it was good and fulfilled what I was lokking for 
 I began reading this novel with high hopes. I thoroughly enjoyed Rosemary's Baby, and could not wait to read the long-awaited sequel. I read the novel on and off for about a week. The book moved at a sluggish pace and I simply couldn't get into it. By the time I came to the ridiculous ending, I was disgusted. I will not give away the ending, but lets just say it's a major disappointment. Save your money and skip this novel.. 
 When one trips the safety key, one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again. This action looses all the time and distance information. The Keys Fitness, who manufactures Ironman and a bunch of others, help line confirmed that this is normal for their products. I see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body 
 Thank you Mr. Corsi for bringing Iran into the forefront of nuclear proliferation.  This is an important subject and one that deserves to be under scrutiny.  However, the author has been caught plagiarizing recently.  So, one has to wonder about the integrity of any data in the book.  Read it with both eyes wide open and make sure you have a clear shot at the garbage can for a rimless shot 
  The book is manipulative and unrealistic. I felt the author was blatantly trying to persuade the reader to believe that infieldey, betrayal and lack of morals is acceptable if you have a self absorbed best friend.  Definitely one of the shallowest books I have ever read.  I bought the book as it was rated as a "best seller" , and I was stuck in an airport for hours on end. The entire plot is hideous as the "burned best friend" makes up reasons why it's accept able to betray her best friend. If I was not completely bored, I would have given up on the book after the first 20 pages. 
 If Kennedy or Vanderbilt is your last name and I mean The Kennedys and The Vanderbilts, if Bill Gates is your wedding sponser or if you are a member of the Royal Family then this book is for you. If you live in the real world you may not want to bother reading a book that would embarrass even Martha Stewart. Even if your wedding budget isn't that of a small nation you can uncover some ideas to use on a realistic day of bliss. But I would leave out the "Honeymoon bed out in the open" next to a swamp unless you are marrying Jeff Corwin or the Crocodile Hunter. Look at page 116 and see if you would like to spend your wedding night there but McBride-Mellinger says "far from sight of the area's inhabitants". It's also far from sight of a bathroom,room service and Walgreen's to get some mosquito spray and close to sight for anything with four or six legs or even eight hairy ones that hopefully would be four groomsmen rather than a spider. As in all the weddings in the book, the cakes are works of art, the prettiest I've ever seen (pgs 106&107, 214&215 "a masterpiece" and the chapter on Confections) and the flowers are magnificent. If you read this book make sure to have a dictionary for all the $2.00 words as it must have been written with a word processor in one hand an a Thesaurus in the other. Also, a really good cook book will come in handy to try and figure out what everyone was eating. McBride-Mellinger is even so helpful as to tell you how to dress the "help" as if in this day and time the guests even know what to wear, where the "help" should go to the bathroom, and to prepare food incase they work more then four hours. But do show respect because Maria McBride-Mellinger has a very high opinion of herself and a much over inflated ego. "The Perfect Wedding Reception" is that: perfectly ostentatious,pretentious,over the top and prefectly not for middle class America. The book is a "perfect" waste of a good tree. For over 30 years I have been a floral artist and wedding planner with the experience of over 500 weddings in all parts of the US and Europe 
 This may be "how Mexico really is," but its not a good movie. After reading all the great reviews I was expecting much more. But like 21 Grams, it is just a movie about people you don't really care about because you don't get to know them well enough. You feel like a voyeur on other people's miserable lives and you never get inside their heads enough to really care. Its like watching a sit com, just splashed all over a big screen. There is too much violence without a point. The acting is good but the stories are blah, especially the middle one, and the themes are not developed very well. Its too much "film-making" without anough story. The style doesn't hook into the story and there is very little emotion generated. I simply didn't care, and I would never want to see it again.  Y tu mama tambien is much, much better. 
 I'm thankful I didn't pay for this junk--I borrowed the book from a friend. Jeon's writing style leaves a lot to be desired-he often presents rambling, confusing ideas through antecdotes from his own life. Usually these stories involve him setting his friends straight with the wisdom he's acquired. This wisdom has come to him through the many relationships he keeps reminding us he's had. When I got to the part where he counsels a friend who just discovered his girlfriend's breasts are fake I had to throw the book down. The real fake is Jeon--who poses as a writer and spiritual leader but who's really just another hack.  
 I'm a huge fan of McCall Smith's series, The No. 1 Ladies Detective, (which is captivating, by the way), so I was amazed and disappointed by the lack of depth, warmth between characters, insight, and humor in this book which usually characterizes the series I know and love. The plot lacks direction, and the characters are boring, without depth, and relate to each other as if they don't know one another. This is a very poor read and a great disappointment from a talented author. 
 It does not bother me when a self-help book presents itself as such and simply offers advice to its readers.  But it bothers me greatly when a "pop" psychology book pretends to base its conclusions on "scientific" evidence when in reality its conclusions are based on nothing more than flimsy anecdotes.    If you are the sort of reader that thinks anecdotal "evidence" is sufficient, then you'll probably like this book on "How a Man's Mind Really Works" (the subtitle).  But you will be fooled into thinking you're learning something new.  Here is a sample of the sort of "evidence" the author provides (or does not provide):  1. "Over the past twenty years I have been researching male and female biology . . ." (p. 270).  What, where, and when has he published?  Nothing of his "research" is cited, either here or in any other book I own on sex differences.  The author wants the veneer of scientific cover but fails to provide anything of substance for his assertions.  2. As a reference for his assertions regarding "The Biology of Commitment,"  he cites only Janet Evanovich's novel,"Two for the Dough." If that doesn't make you LOL, you are not acquainted with the amazing Stephanie Plum (who has not yet added "biological research" to her list of accomplishments). I've never before seen a supposedly non-fiction book cite fictional characters as evidence for its assertions! Have you? What does this tell you about the author's attitude toward his readers?   3. The author writes, "Supporting anecdotes and stories from individuals who have lived out biological trends are crucial, I believe, to the understanding of the male brain.  When we put hard sciences together with soft, then combine these sciences with diverse life stories, we can investigate the mysteries of a subject--in our case, the male mind--with greater confidence." (p. xix)      What does "individuals who have lived out biological trends" mean? [individuals who are alive? who were alive?].  The fact is that the "hard science" in this book is minimal: the brain structures and functions the author mentions have been known for the past 30 years.  His new "evidence" consists of stories that illustrate his preconceptions.  There is just enough of the male stereotype to provoke an "AHA!" reaction in some readers. But what percentage of men do NOT fit any particular stereotype?  Alas, the author never raises and thus does not answer such a profound question.  He's too busy with his "neurobiological research," I guess.  4. The author's sole "credentials" consist of being the author of prior pop psychology books.  His educational background is not provided.  Although he refers to himself as a "family therapist," he provides no evidence that he is licensed to practice.  He is not a member of the American Psychological Association.      If you are looking for a well-written book that contains actual scientific evidence of male-female differences, I suggest Simon Baron-Cohen's "The Essential Difference."    
 this thing is the cheatest thing ive ever seen in my life. it takes for ever to assemble it and then the cheap plastic is the worst of its kind!!! a WWE wrestler would have troble stirring it. you need stuff from home like vandillinium and rubidum just to make an ounce of the stuipid ice cream that tastes like something that was scraped of the underside of a boot!!!! when we finnialy got it all craned out, we only got a spoonful and it was a orange color so i didnt try it. plus, you can only make it 2 times before you have to burn more money to buy refills. DO NOT BUY IT IS A PEICE OF JUNK YOU SHOULD WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A BOOK TITLED THE HISTORY OF JUNK AND BORING SCIENCE. IT WOULD BE ALOT BETTER THAN THE CHEAP JUNK THAT MCDONALDS IS TRYING TO SELL JUST BECAUSE THEY ARENT DONING SO GOOD IN THE BURGER BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 When this book was first issued back in 1979, the information was contemporary and useful. Unfortunatley for this book, the world of Ford performance has changed drastically in the last twenty years. I have the  original print of this book and was looking forward to this update. Boy was  I disappointed. The cover says, "Includes all Modern Ford Performance  Engines." I guess this means anything built after the flathead. The  engine building techniques are old, the technology is old, even the part  numbers are old.  No information on the vast array of the new aftermarket  aluminum heads and manifolds, fuel injection, ignition systems, etc. or  anything on the new Modular engines is offered. If you want a nostalgic  look at what it used to be like or general information on older hot rod  Ford engines, this book may be for you. If you have the first printing of  this book or are trying to build a cutting-edge modern Ford engine, forget  it 
 What's here is all pretty listenable `twisted' psychedelia.  I can't quite fathom the logic of those who place among `best albums' though.  I would really rate it about 3 &  stars, but feel it is currently rated too highly overall and 39 minutes is slim pickings for a full-price CD.  The best tracks for me are:  - `I've lived on a dirt road all my life' -  full of life, with shimmering floaty lyrics - a good opener - `Skunks' - warped - jagged sax snatches and eerie synth themes complementing a jaunty beat.  Fabulous - `Jacknuggeted' - minimalist intro, morphing in a number of ways before deconstructing and dissolving into the ether - `Kid you'll move mountains' - a bit like Jesus and Mary Chain on Prozac - strangely engaging - `Crayon' - a joyful, bubbly and captivating little tune - definitely the album highlight; which flows effortlessly into: - `Every time she turns round it's her birthday' - shimmery synth washes around Brit-pop-like fuzzy vocals - a warm and vibrant way to end a good, though not great, album  A few of the other tracks are a bit forgettable.  This is an album best listened to on headphones, as there is a lot of inner detail you could miss otherwise.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is an electronica album - far from it!  I was sucked in by others' rave reviews and Amazon's `people who bought this also bought...' recommendations.  It is just reasonably engaging psychedelia, inventive and easy to listen to.

 If you don't know anything about EMT work, this book may be helpful to you. I am taking classes as an EMT and it didn't help me at all. In most chapters you can practically substitute any career for the word EMT and the  book would still make sense(excluding the chapters "Why become an  EMT" and "All About EMT's"). If you're not familair with EMT  work and have no idea how to get into the field, this book may be a good  choice. For the most part the information in this book is too general for  someone who's already on the path to becoming an EMT 
 I pre-ordered this set and received it today.  The picture quality is terrible.  I've been watching the series on Discovery HD and was anxiously awaiting the release of the original BBC series and was not happy with the video quality.  I bought the regular DVD series, but the edges of everything were blurred together.  I watch regular DVDs and get better quality than this.  Perhaps it was a bad run of the DVD set as they might have been rushing to put it out?  I am using a progressive scan with HDMI upconversion and have a 52" 1080p LCD set.  Maybe I will just wait until the HD war is over and get it on the preferred format??  Any other issues like this 
 It was a fluke that I saw Hamlet w/Olivier a week before I saw this atrocity. This was the worst version of Hamlet I have ever experienced, it was like a production from my high school. I just couldn't get into it...everyone sounded as if they just arrived from deepest Ohio. Horrible! From Bill Murray to Ethan Hawke no vocal nuances, all very speechified with no feeling for the subject. So I watched half of the movie and put it out in the hall so some other sucker could experience this dreck. ginger 
 There's really not much reason to buy this album.  A year before this was released, Mannheim released an album called "Halloween," which was a two-disc set, with one disc featuring music (mostly Mannheim arrangements of "scary" classical pieces like "Hall Of The Mountain King," plus a few rehases of old Fresh Aire tunes), and the other disc featured spooky sound effects.  "Monster Mix" takes samplings from that two-disc set and gives you the abridged version on one disc for a couple of dollars less.  They also threw in "Full Moon", which was first released on their "Ambience Series" album, "Autumn Song."  Incidentally, I like their "Autumn Song" album quite a bit better than either "Halloween" or "Monster Mix," but you can only get it directly through Mannheim's official website.  For those who aren't familiar with the tracks on this disc-- some of the tracks are decent, though none reached the quality of music that Mannheim put out back in the late 80s/early 90s.  Synthesizers always played a heavy role in Mannheim's music, but here, they get a bit overbearing and everything starts to sound a bit cheap and over-quantized (in other words, it all feels like it was machine generated-- which, I suppose, it was.)    Still, if you like the Steamroller sound, and you want to hear them attempt a holiday other than Christmas, you may find this interesting for a couple of listens.  But then, just pay the extra dollar or two and get the full double-disc set called "Halloween."  Better yet, go to their website (mannheimsteamroller.com) and try "Autumn Song."            
 The problem with Computer Shopper is, it's neither a serious trade magazine like PC Mag, or a shopper's paradise like its former self was.  If you want hardware tips, Maximum PC is way better.  You can find pretty much everything in Computer Shopper for free on the web .. 
 I didn't find this book helpful, and here's why:  My 10 year old daughter tends to over eat and crave unhealthy foods, so I'm working on educating her on nutrition and keeping her active.  I thought this book looked like a good resources, but the problem is that it looks like a young child's book, even though it contains good information in the second half, appropriate to an older child.  So, my 10 year old took one look at it, declared it a 'baby's book' (because the cover and art and first pages look like it's designed for a very young child), and I couldn't get her further in it, because she prides herself on now being able to read 'big kid' (chapter type) books.  The packaging/art approach just don't match the level of the content 
 she is one of the great portrait photographers.  her work is intelligent and her images approach iconic in status.  that said, this book is not what you want to see.  it is primarily about her private life and the photos just are not interesting unless perhaps you're her cousin or something.  any of her other books blow this one away and wll contain the amazing work you associate with her name.  this should have been entitled: "300 boring pictures of susan sontag".  should be remaindered in a couple of months.  save your money 
 Full of hatred as the first one, just the sources of this last one tell us everything about how the writer of that biography has written it : using tabloids and people magazines.... That's all, so no doubt about the poor accuracy of the content. Better buy other books on Mr Gibson 
 I ordered on 10/4/2005. As of March 27th, I still haven't received the first issue, I don't even want it now! How do I get credit for the payment made back in October 
 Title Should Be:  Just Another Six Sigma Book  I guess I'm the dumb one, because I was expecting a book that simplified and clarified the Six Sigma process.  After all, isn't that the purpose of the "for Dummies" series?  Well, this book does neither.  On page 2 of the book, near the top of the page, it says, "Six Sigma For Dummies is ... a comprehensive, actionable description of the methods and tools of Six Sigma."  A few lines later, however, it says that "...the field of Six Sigma is much too large to fit in only 400 pages."  This indecision on the authors' goals permeates the whole book.   The book has three authors, and as you read this book you suspect that they didn't collaborate at all on their approach to this topic.  For example, the statistics portion of the book is 165 pages long, with line after line after line after line of statistical info.  Then you get to the "tool" section of the book, where you will supposedly learn how to actually apply the statistics.  Even though at the beginning of this section it says, "You can't do Six Sigma without tools," the whole section of practitioner tools is less than 40 pages long.  Only a brief overview is given of each tool, without enough detail for anyone to actually do Six Sigma work!  Sure, statistics are important for Six Sigma, but for a person just being introduced to Six Sigma, the coverage is excessive and not done all that well.  If someone wants to learn statistics at this level, they would be far better off getting Basic Statistics, by Kiemele, Schmidt, and Berdine.  If someone wants a general reference book for Quality, including Six Sigma, get the massive (over 800 pages) The Six Sigma Handbook, by Thomas Pyzdek.  If someone wants a book that gives a practical and workable approach to Six Sigma in general, consider Statistics for Six Sigma Made Easy, by Brussee.    It isn't that anything presented in Six Sigma For Dummies is actually wrong.  It's just, as an earlier reviewer observed, that the book does not have a target audience.  And the book certainly doesn't fulfill the implied promise of a "dummies" book to simplify and clarify the subject.  Dedicated Black Bel 
 JESUS HELP ME! THIS MOVIE WAS SO CORNY, I SHOULD FIND THE DIRECTOR AND PUT HIM IN JAIL! WHAT MAKES THIS MOVIE SO EWW, THEY DIDN'T EVEN FILM THE MOVIE IN NEW YORK! ALL THEY DID WAS SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF FOOTAGE OF A EVERYDAY NEW YORK STREET, THEN IT WILL CUT OFF QUICKLY OF THE NEW YORK STREET AND HAVE THE CHARACTERS STANDING IN BUILDINGS! WHEN THEY DID SHOW THE VOLCANO ERUPTING IT SHOWED PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND IN A CITY THAT LOOKED LIKE BOSTON OR PHILLY! PLUS WHEN THEY SHOWED THE CHARACTERS STANDING OUT SIDE OF THIS NOT NEW YORK STREETS THEY HAD POLICE SIRENS GOING OFF IN THE BACK GROUND THE WHOLE TIME! TAKE IT FROM ME PEOPLE I LIVE IN BROOKLYN, YOU DON'T HEAR SIRENS LIKE THAT ALL DAY! PLEASE DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GARBAGE 
 I wrote a review of what I take as a significant distortion and failing of this book.  I note that this review has not been posted on the site.  I am wondering why 
 "Two Virgins" lives up to its title--it sounds like it was created by someone with absolutely no musical experience at all. While I'm a big fan of Lennon's Beatles and post-Beatles solo albums (even the weakest Lennon album "Sometime in New York City" has its minor moments), I found this completely unlistenable and a waste of 30 minutes of my time.   Is "Two Virgins" misunderstood? If it is it's because it's in an incomphrensible musical langauge. The cover was the only thing this album was notable for--a nude portrait of a couple who had found love. It created controversy (EMI didn't want to distribute it). As avant-garde its too simplistic as music it's a disaster. Avoid unless you must have everything (including every fart, belch and toe nail trimming) from Lennon 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 The author of this book wants you to believe that on 9/11/01 two airplanes did NOT strike the World Trade Center, but instead they were destroyed by some sort of space-based "star wars" (his term, not mine) direct energy weapon.  Yes, according to this book, the thousands of New Yorkers who saw the second plane hit are either lying or mistaken.  Pure science fiction and a disgrace to the victims.   
 This set of 566 cards follows on the first set of 440 cards.  I find it highly inappropriate for cards targeted at someone who has studied at least 400 Kanji to use Romaji.  Romaji distracts experienced students, misleads beginner students, and serves no real purpose once you have studied the basic forty or so set of Hiragana.  I returned these cards after a week because of the Romaji 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 This was not the edition I wanted, as follows: I initially found the desired edition, including a photo of the cover, followed the links for available copies, including this one which I purchased (which, BTW, did not have a photo of cover, but I assumed it was same edition as on the initial page). Was dismayed to receive this different edition. It matters because it was for a friend's college course. Professors often reference pages in the assigned edition, which do not correspond to another edition's page numbering. Please minimize such confusion by more accurate advertising (include a cover photo on every linked page, to ensure it matches the initial one) or more accurate linking--i.e. don't show a specific search result but then link to other books that are not the same one, unless again, there are cover photos or other info displayed to distinguish them 
 We had a rude awaking today, our Delonghi toaster was on fire. I will never again buy any Delonghi product. The defective design is in the toast switch. It is mechanical. When it finishes toasting, it sometimes continues to the "Always On" position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast: very, very hot. We literally had a house full of smoke & a toaster full of flames. You were warned.  Funny thing is, Delonghi makes an attractive product. Sad thing is, they can cost you your house or worse 
 I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust 
 I was suckered into buying this years ago and the sound was so bad that I immediately sold it as used for pennies on the dollar.  I strongly suggest you buy another anthology of their music instead 
 Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish.  There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption.  I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out 
 The Meat Puppets where one of the best bands of the 80s, but once they got signed off SST to a major label they seemed to have lost something. They didn't sell out, but a certain amount of soul present on "II" and "Up On the Sun" just wasn't there. The problem is they seemed to get swept up in the grunge explosion that happened. That isn't to say this is a terrible record. There are a few good songs, notibly their big hit "Backwater" amoung a few others. However, something just wasn't there. The lyrics weren't as funny or as emotional as before, and it leaves no lasting affect. I know there are many who disagree with me. If you like grunge such as Soundgarden and Mudhoney, you'll probably like this. If you like classic Puppets however, you'll not like this too much. Not bad by all means, just not that great either 
 Yes it touches on points that affect the user experience but it is so disjointed and abstract to be almost a hindrance.    Listen, the guy may have some good ideas and probably knows how to create an effective user-experience but this book should never have been written. You can't write an entire book on user experience based on a sketch you did in 1999. 
 I think this book had a boring ending it ended as if it was a movie that was going to have a sequel to it. There was no point to the ending of the book. The only thing I liked about the book was that it showed that no matter what race anyone was they should get along. All in All this book did not interest me 
 I bought this book because I'd read and enjoyed some of Alexandra Robbins' others.  But man, was this one boring.  Slow moving.  Repetitive.  You get the picture.  I couldn't even finish it.  Of course, for a book airing the views of twentysomethings, I guess I shouldn't have been expecting dazzling insights or anything.  As an age group, judging from this book, it appears we don't really have much to say for ourselves, sigh.  The sorority one and the Yale secret society one were much more interesting 
 I have been a Betty Grable fan since I was small.  It is odd for a kid today to rather watch old movies than new ones.  I am now in my twenties and interested in bios.  Betty and Ginger Rogers have always been my favorites.  After reading this book, I do not like Betty Grable.  It seems as if the author and Ms. Grable are both very stuck on HER.  She seems VAIN from my understanding of the book.  I could not finish it because the more I read, the more I disliked her, and I want to enjoy her movies.  Ginger Rogers "Ginger: My story" and Ester Williams "Million Dollar Marmaid" autobiographies were much more interesting.  I suggest those over this one any day 
 This book was difficult to get through.  The writing felt very, well, written.  Imagine an FBI agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy.  Imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as "this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent" and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe, and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is.  Baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough "zingers" on every page.  He has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances, so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results.  I personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion.    Add to this the idiocy of the main character--acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist, and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages, and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work.  I shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes--when Sydney has met with a "deadly" [Baldacci's thesaurus apparently has only two words: deadly and murderous] intruder in her home, Sydney has a weapon trained on him at near-point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch!  "Milliseconds" before she can fire, he launches himself behind the couch.    Is this "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?"  No, just Baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint 
 "Dog Days" isn't interesting for its characters or the plot, which is chick lit meets roman-a-clef political satire.   Indeed, the best parts of the book come from a few lines where the characters observe life in Washington for the political/media elite.   For example, one character had a great take on why 40-year-old men in DC date twentysomething interns. Another describes what a Washington cocktail party is REALLY like. Later in the book, another character muses on the effectiveness of President Golden (read: Bush) "pushing Mom, flag, apple pie, pickup trucks and mortgages" during his re-election campaign.   "There's a whole generation of young people who live a life based on absentee parents and McDonald's vegetarianism, credit card debt and one-night hookups," the character says. "They're entering the professional class now and their mores and norms will define the new middle class."  This remark would have made a more interesting essay to read than passing dialogue in a novel. I think this book would have been better if the author threw out the fiction and stuck to full-length essays in the style that made her noteworthy in the first place.

 This book has 30 pages of obvious and worthless information. The book is very thin; when the box from Amazon arrived I looked in the box and almost didn't find the book, that's how thin it is. Of course it is quality not quantity that matters, and there too this book falls short. It was not written by a psychologist, in fact the educational qulifications of the author are not revealed. He is a "management consultant to churches." The average web page has more information than this book. Definitely not worth the price 
 This book is designed for someone who has prior knowledge with the underlying systems of a computer network.  It is fairly in-depth, and explains a lot, but I think that for a true beginner it is hard to comprehend.  I am working on a degree in Computer Science, so it wasn't like I was new to the idea of networking, but I found it hard to digest a lot of the technical aspects of this book.  Some things could have been made to be more of an overview, rather than in-depth explanation of how something works at a bit level.  I am now taking CCNA training, and some of the things talked about in this book do not relate at all to what someone needs to understand a working network.  
 I was so excited when I recieved this humidifier at my baby shower. But after several tries, I finally returned it. This product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically. Well, the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on, my baby wakes up crying!!! Note that I live 2 miles from an airforce base, and the planes don't even wake her!!!! Don't buy this product 
 A fun read, but you'll finish it in under an hour and it doesn't really lend itself to a re-read. Even the pictures are more glance at them once then move on icons than bits of art you'll ponder for more than a second.   On the other the book would make a fun gift for the guy that fixes your computer for you. If you're already yelling "Hey! I take care my own computer. Sheesh!", then you probably already own the book. Heck, I bought it. So if you don't already own it and just have to buy it, read it carefully and then wrap it up as a silly gift to someone else 
 This is a poor exegetical work by Tony.  He doesn't do his best.  There are far better works to consider 
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 I bought this book to have a better insight on her life and story. The first part of the book is about Mary M. if she lived today. It was a good story, but that is not what I bought the book for. The second part of the book is nothing but the writers view of religion and not about the life of Mary M. Oh well, you can't have it all 
 UNFORTUNATELY, I NEVER RECEIVED THIS BOOK AND I AM UNABLE TO RATE IT!  THE CLASS IS IN THE SECOND WEEK.  I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BORROW THIS BOOK FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TO KEEP UP WITH THE CLASS READING. I HAVE CONTACTED SAID BOOK COMPANY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  THE REPLY I RECEIVED WAS THAT THE BOOK WAS ENROUTE.  I ORDERED A BOOK AT A LATER TIME, IN FACT TWO OR SO WEEKS AFTER THIS ONE AND RECEIVED IT IN LESS THAN A WEEKS TIME. I AM STILL WAITING ON THE ARRIVAL OF SAID BOOK 
 Having used Turbo Tax since 1990 I feel that I am qualified to comment on it. I have also used Quicken, Quicken Deluxe, Quicken Home & Business, QuickBooks Pro 2003 & QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition. The Turbo Tax product seems to get more user UN-FRIENDLY each year.  The navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early 2000's.  Like I said I WAS using QuickBooks Pro 2003 until tax time last year.  I purchased Turbo Tax Home & Business like I had for the past 4 years, and really got a shock when I found out that it would not import my data from QuickBooks Pro 2003.  Three year old software that was not compatible with Turbo Tax in 2006(actually 2005 tax year).  I ended up purchasing QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition 2006  ($280+) in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done.  Intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed.  I am done with them and will purchase TaxCut this year 
 Used the product for about a month.  I was deceived by the add thinking I was getting a knife sharpener with a electric grinding wheel like I had growing up on the back of the can opener.  The one on this can opener is just a slide though, and doesn't work well.  The unit is light weight and falls over easily with big cans.  The blade and lid carrier falls off quite a bit.  I didn't send it back because it was cheap and not worth the trouble.  If your looking for a can opener and an electric knife sharpener keep looking, don't buy this one.  
 The "Everything Grant Book" is not very helpful to those who are serious about trying to locate and obtain grant funding.  The book provides a very broad-brush approach to grant writing with limited examples.  The first seven chapters go back-and-forth between government and foundation grants, which is very confusing, especially for the beginning grant writer.  Even though government and foundation grants have some common elements, they require very different approaches.  When the reader finally reaches Chapter 8 "Components of a Grant Proposal," it really discusses solicitations, with only one page dedicated to grant components.  Chapter 9 provides very basic information about preparing to writer a grant.  Chapter 10 talks about "letters of support," which seems out-of-place considering the authors have yet to discuss the major elements of a grant proposal.  Chapters 11-15 discuss the real conponents of most government grants, but once again fail to provide a comprehensive presentation with realistic examples.  Chapter 16 "Other Grant Proposal Sections" includes information (staff qualifications, management plan, etc.) that really belongs in Chapter 13 "Action Plans."  Chapter 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 include very basic information about writing, reviewing, and filling out forms, and submitting proposals.  The book ends with "Writing Grants as a Career," which seems like an awkward ending.  If I had to rely on this book to give me the background to be a grant writer, I would be struggling to make a living.  I suggest potential grant writers look for a book that has only one emphasis (government or foundation), is better organized, and provides more contemporary examples.  
 and i guess along, i knew it would be!!! dark shadows 1966-71 is the only dark shadows. period.!!! THERE IS NO.. nor...EVER CAN BE a "revival" of the original...sorry! "revival" was a VERY forgettable attempt by dan curtis (genius) to desparately cling on to an old idea...and i don't blame him, cause it' is my favorite show of all time, but by the 90's, the people and the mood was altogether different fom the 60's...cast and acting not of 66-71 caliber, destined to fail because of that alone...was time to seal the old coffin up 1n 1971...and not be disturbed in '90 or '91 or whenever the heck it was.  
 As has been pointed out this is essentially arguing the neo-con worldview and makes a great appeal to nationalism, in this case not merely one country but anglo-saxons as a whole. From this standpoint he paints a picture of a great but maligned and self-hating race that was justified in all it's past actions and, more to the point, is essential for the future of the planet. As a feel good book it's very good and many will love it for tapping into suppressed nationalism in a P.C. world But two massive chasms of thought seperate this from reality. One is the obvious historical glosses so much a feature of neo-con thought. Revisionism is what it says, giving past events a different vision from what we used to believe about them - and any book that is sloppy with the facts is more than likely revisionist itself Secondly it doesn't take into account the vast struggle we had to achieve even basic human rights, such as women's rights and resurrecting the old greek (yes greek) idea of representative government. This was not by virtue of 'anglo-saxon' race but a struggle within to achieve those ideals. It's this struggle that has made us great, but this book talks like these things come by virtue of being 'english speaking' In effect he denies we ever struggled for those things but they came naturally by virtue of our race. Reminds me of something someone else once said I don't need to read a book to feel good about my culture... but I don't feel good about where it is going if this kind of book represents the best thoughts of those in charge and what they would have us believe 
 I was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching. First of all, I thought it's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom. Secondly, the things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh. I never had problems with students in my classes, I always tried to encourage them to like the subjects; I am sure they learned many things, as well as I learned from them, too. This book was just a waste of time. The worst thing is that the teacher I am talking about, the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is, doesn't practice what the book preaches! She is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to. How is it possible? She didn't learn anything from it???  Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious. But being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states, I could imagine it wouldn't really be that good. 
 I really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost 6 months.  When they came I was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained.  I was extremely disappointed that the product was defective, because I have never had a problem with any Amazon products in the past, I sent it back and I was reimbursed for my purchase.  I am really disappointed I will think twice before I purchase any shoes from Amazon again 
 I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him.  At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying.  Like toilet paper 
 I bought this product at Sephora.  I had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times.  When I tried to use it after that, the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work.  I took it back to Sephora for an exchange since I was still within the 30 day exchange period.  The second one worked for about two months...then the SAME thing happened.  I was only using it maybe once or twice a week, the most.  This product is horrible.  I never dropped it or anything like that.  In fact, as soon as it would cool down after using, I would place it back in the box it came in.  I am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer.  Honestly, I wanted a good flat iron and I thought this was a good product because it was expensive...BIG MISTAKE.  My friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  She also straightens her hair a lot more often than I do.  I don't know why I didn't ask her where she got hers.  Please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  If you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is.  
 I've read it. I wish I hadn't The illos are nice, but the backstory makes no sense at all. And the writing goes downhill the further you get into the book. By the time you reach Kong's origins, you no longer care.  Go see the movie. Either the original, or the new one. Heck, see  the 76 version, even THAT'S better than THIS. 
 SAVE YOUR MONEY. HAVE TRIED DUAL CEREAL DISPENSER FROM JC PENNY'S. AGAIN SAVE YOUR MONEY. CRUSH,JAM,FLEMSY,MESSY, ETC. . NOT KID FRIENDLY !! NOT WORTH THE MONEY. USE TUPPERWARE UNTIL SOMEONE MAKES THIS PRODUCT PROPERLY.. 
 Buckminster Fuller was undoubtedly an interesting man with many interesting ideas, indeed some extremely interesting ideas.  Unfortunately this book, which is much more a picture album than a thoughtful book, is so perfunctory that I gained few, if any, insights into Fuller's thinking 
 I read a lot of the reviews online about how fantastic this book was for anyone that was thinking of or having a destination wedding. After looking through this book, I think this is more helpful for those planning an international destination wedding. I am planning a domestic U.S. destination wedding at the Stein Eriksen Lodge in Utah (I live in MN) and could not find anything in this book about Utah. In fact, there were quite a few states that didn't have any information on them. I wanted to look at marriage laws pertaining to each state, etc.. but I was extremely disappointed. Even while looking through some of the resources, many websites that were in the book didn't exist so I had to search for them online anyways. I was really disappointed with the book overall. The author gives some good reminders, but most of them are common sense. Again, I would recommend this book for someone leaving the US to get married, but if not, I'd look for another one to read instead of wasting your money on this one. 
 Do You Love the police?   the best performance revolutionary reggae pop rock of the 80's?  ME TOO!   this CD is a must have for the die hard police fans out there,  just for the awsome cover art.  other than that... ehh.   its not amazing... and if you don't like the police then you will kick yourself for buying this album.  So i'f you like police then get it; otherwise,  go to the related item link on this site and click on like syncronicity or Reggata de blanc...  those are more rewarding.  ohh, and canary in a coal mine...Dawg Munn 
 There's something fundamentally wrong with the concept of a puzzle book for an application programming interface.  A book about an API should yield clarity, not puzzles 
 it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because  it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off.  PARENTS THIS MACHINE DOSEN'T WORK ONLY MADE WITH SUGER THATS ALL IT IS AND ALSO IT TAKES FOREVER ?

 On page after page of this book, Western Imperialism shines through. It's over, Mr. Bell. The Empire is no more! I could not bring myself to finish this book. I was that offended by the apparent xenophobia and the preposterous plot 
 honestly, who's the man who signs these "christian" rappers? why do they all have to sound so corny? it irks me because i'd really like to see christian rap become huge. what christian rap needs are some more groups like the gospel gangstas who've lived that thug life and have come out of it thanks to God's grace and through salvation. there shouldn't be these guys from out in the sticks of iowa who sound like the wiggles and rap about corny topics. christian rap should sound almost exactly like secular rap in flow and beat and slang but with christian lyrics. it truly is possible and i guarantee will cause nonbelievers to turn to the truth. last year i tried so hard to get into christian rap. i tried and tried and tried. however, it just wasn't possible. so now the only type of christian music i'll listen to is steven curtis chapman or jars of clay or paul coleman trio. christian rock artists do a good job keeping abreast with what's hot. why can't the rappers do the same? you got me. for now i'm stuck listening to the likes of dipset, nas, jay-z, jadakiss, and t.i. 
 The descriptions don't mention the creepy voice that says "It's lullabye time" before it launches into an seriously off-key rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Firefly (huh? was there a copyright problem with using "little star"?) You can press the moon button to skip the first song, so I didn't have too much trouble with this- most of the songs after the first are mercifully without vocals. Later on this same Robo-Mom also says "I love you", which is seriously spooky. Aside from this, the "amazing 3-D ceiling light" is really more of a rotating circular slide projection of some cartoon animals, and the bee-and- LED light show on the actual toy looks really old-fashioned. The nature sounds are ok, but I am pretty sure one of the sounds is "plank of wood tapping against another plank of wood".   Even with all of this, I was still willing to strap it to my son's crib and see how he liked it- and within the first five minutes the projector light flickered on and off, and the Robo-Mom got stuck and kept saying "It's lullabye time" over and over. 
 Soft is the new loud, so I hear, but on the basis of these at-home recordings by this wanna-be folkie, I'd venture that dull is the new inspired. "Veneer" proves only that anyone, no matter how lacking in talent, can get a record deal (and a TV commercial). Jose Gonzalez plays sloppy guitar and sings like he's falling asleep. At best he sounds a little like a tired and bored Jose Feliciano (a brilliant singer and guitarist who was light years beyond this guy 40 years ago). Trade up, way up, to Jose Feliciano and some other pros, like Nick Drake, John Martyn, Mick Abrahams, Arlo Guthrie, Richard and Mimi Farina, Joni Mitchell, John Williams, Joe Pass, Ian Tyson, Dion DiMucci, Robert Johnson, Vince Gill, Jorma Kaukonen, Freddie King, Joan Baez, Peter Lang, and John Fahey, to name but a few major guitar and (for most of the above) vocal talents who leave Jose Gonzalez in the dust.  
 Have this unit in out house, we have the one with one base unit and two mobile units.  A few things to note. The ones we had do not offer rechargeable batteries. It uses alkaline only, or if you have your own charger you could use rechargeable but would be nicer if it recharged while plugged in.  We live in NYC, Queens to be exact. We hear taxi cab radio chatter over this at times, especially at night. Also if unit is close to base unit static is not too bad but still annoying in bedroom, BUT if you have it one floor away, forget it. Unless child is screaming all you hear is static. on both units.  Only has two channels A & B which are set manually at both base and hand held units. So if you have a bad signal in middle of night, you have to go into child's room and change channel. Just don't wake the baby! Ouch!  Also missing a pager and a "walkie talkie" feature. They would be very nice. Not a deal breaker if they don't have it BUT it can be handy especially if your two floors up with baby with a full diaper and Spouse is in basement and you need more diapers from Garage.  I am about to have a second child, and I am replacing this unit with a better one, I am looking at one of the new digital units that have the noise/static reduction. Consumer Reports gave some of them their top marks. They are however way more pricey than these, some are near $200 and only one receiver. But they all have charging bases and most importantly they are static free with AUTO channel switching 
 Who does William Henry think he is releasing this piece of S*%t. The quality of both the video and audio is very poor. No time or care was put into the production of this DVD. When you pay over $50 for a dvd you would expect it to be of decent quality. This is the first and last William Henry product I will ever buy. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. Shame on you William Henry. 
 This book apparently is part of a many book long series, which you MUST read in order to understand it.  Unfortunately, NO indication is given of this on the book itself.  The story skips around through a series of non-related characters and sub-storylines that maybe make sense if you have read the rest, but as a standalone book it is worthless.  The writing style is decent, but nothing is ever really explained well enough for you to piece things together.  Usually when I pick up a book that is part of a series, the author explains things well enough that I can get an idea of 'what has happened before'.  Not in this book.  There are NO clues at all.  It was very confusing 
 I saw this movie quite a few years ago (probably about 15 or 20 years ago). I must say the first time I saw it I wasn't really impressed. Then I read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that Marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie. So when it was released on DVD I went out and purchased it. I remember little about it from the first time other than it had Sissy Spacek in it in one of her first roles, if not her very first big screen role. I must say that I didn't find this movie any better now than I did then. I appreciate Marvins career and his acting as well as Gene Hackman. These two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good. The story could have been much better and the core of it is good. Marvin is a respected Chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by Eddie Egan (the real Popeye Doyle from the French Connection drug bust in New York) to collect $500,000 that an associate name Mary Ann has forgotten to pay. Mary Ann (Gene Hackman... and don't ask me why he is Mary Ann cause they never explain it) is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house. He has sent back several other bag men to the Chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them. Mary Ann also is now with Marvins old flame Clarabell (Jeez what is with these stupid names?). Mary Ann also deals in white slavery, enter Sissy Spacek. He sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows.   This is an interesting novelty kind of movie. If you are a fan of Marvin or Hackman check it out. Even if you are a fan of Sissy Spacek. But alas this movie is just not that good. The old school mob vs the new middle America mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie. 
 As a 3rd year EE student I have seen a lot of textbooks.  This one is one of the worst textbooks I have seen.  The topics covered by this book are very important but are explained very poorly.  The explanations are longwinded and the few examples are far from useful.  I would avoid this book if possible 
 This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book!  They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book...  What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be 
 I expected alot more from Richard Harris. He was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of Abraham. Also, there wasn't enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible. I was somewhat annoyed that the movie had God saying that Sarai's name means Princess and that he would change it to Sarah which means Queen. This is not true!! In Hebrew Sarah means princess. Such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability 
 I honestly feel that Tesla reached the end here. After "Psychotic Supper" failed to get the label support that it desparately needed the group just fell apart. With this the whole metal scene was falling away anyhow as grunge was dying off after the death of Kurt Cobain, and here was Tesla trying to make up it's mind what way to go. With the opening track "The Gate" it sounded like they were going to head back to the hair days of the 80's, but then the next song "Solution" they played like a lost and wandering band of the 90's. The rest of the songs just followed suit. The groups slogan is "No Machines", but there's also another slogan at foot here, and that's "No Music Direction", and for some bands that's possibly a workable concept as long as there's an inkling of where the bands roots are. With Tesla it's all over the board where they would score a top 10 hit with an acoustic version of the song "Signs", which is a rock song, to where they do a cover here of Joe South's "Games People Play". I feel that Tesla failed to show thier influences here, and was just trying to make a living; which is not a bad thing, but it pretty much kept them at a cult status. I pretty much had this album, but didn't listen to it at the time as I was trying to leave the secular music scene behind, and just move onto Christianity, and I know the album lurked around in my head all this time, so I felt it was time to face it; I feel that the album is below par for a group that can do some memorable songs, and to me it seems they wanted out of the label, and possibly away from each other. 
 This movie was so bad (How Bad Was It?) that I turned it off after about 25 minutes. This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE 
 This book is about accepting change but not how to embrace it. It is a very easy book to read because it is a story format. This book did not help me deal with change in my life. 
 What's the deal with glorifying gangster behavior?  This cat is a poor role model for youngsters with his swagger and gangster affectations.  The author needs to straighten out this feline 
 I have never felt / heard sheets that were so scratchy and loud.  I returned both sets that I purchased.  Even after washing with warm water, with softner, nothing worked and again, the sound of these sheets would wake you up as you turned on them 
 As a guide to wines of the world, this book is really disappointing. Capitalizing on the fame and popularity of the former WTC Windows on the World, it sounded like an excellent bet. Unfortunately, it seems to be just a collection of commentary that might have taken place during evenings of wine samplings, and is completely useless as a reference guide 
 I have heard that Alice Walker is an incredible writer, which may be true (it is forgivable, since this was her first novel), but I found The Third Life of Grange Copeland to be extremely disappointing. First of all, I expected more quality in it -- this read like a soap opera story. This is why I shy away from best-sellers, but I thought Walker might be different. I can see her strengths in writing, but I do not even feel as if a vivid portrait of anything was painted. The characters, the home, the reasons behind many of the abrupt actions were all left unanswered. After putting up with that plot throughout the book, I expected a decent ending (I stuck it out). However, the ending was the worst part, as it came suddenly and then the novel was over. I still plan on reading other books by Alice Walker, but I would not recommend this one to anyone demanding a good plot 
 In my only other review of a Coben book('Gone For Good') I was concerned that he was relying too much on formulaic plots(guy loses girl, goes through hell, uncovers 'deep, dark, secret', and big plot twist at the end reveals all.) Unfortunately, every one of those characteristics is present in 'TNO', and the result is a terrible novel! It's not even good enough to be classed as a 'fun junk food' read. The plot is full of idiotic developments that are meant to be 'surprises', and ridiculously convoluted action/chase scenes. Yet another aspiring screenplay masquerading as a book. I won't even attempt to explain the plot. I suppose the only good thing I can say about the story is it didn't turn out to be another hokey 'serial killer' drama, after all...though that would have been an improvement! There are far too many cases of characters 'keeping secrets' and double-crossing each other...but the 'big secret' revealed at the end is the worst of all, destroying the slim chance that the reader might actually salvage something from this train-wreck.Plenty of other readers have already commented on the ridiculous supporting cast, which seems to be a Coben trademark, alongside his New York settings and poor plotting, so I'll skip them, and hope 'Hester' doesn't mind!  Read if you're a Coben fan, skip if you actually like stories that make sense and lead somewhere 
 This book did not live up to expectations.  The discussions of the rounds did not tell the reader enough useful information.  There were a lot of fun to know facts - amaze your friends and all of that - but not enough information on how to use the round, good ranges to sight in the various rounds versus potential uses, reloading insights (best loads, best rifle twists for what bullet weight) and more of that kind of technical information.  That is why I only gave the book two stars 
 Let me start by saying I was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going.  I imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up, or find them if we got lost (or god forbid worse).  I bought two from Amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the Amazon order to arrive.  I took my girlfriend's niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked...five minutes later mine locked up.  I went and found my niece..."Uncle XXXX, why does the screen look all funny"  The units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up...so I exchanged them, but then, so did the two I got in exchange.  I thought perhaps I got a bad batch from the local store, but when the Amazon units arrived, they had the same problem.  We took them out for a stroll with some friends from MBA school...the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers..."dude, these %!".  Forget, locating the people in your party, even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks.  (I should know, I was so excited when I ordered the radios that I applied immediately for a GMRS license with the FCC).  The Rino 530's simply don't work well.  A combined GPS and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product, but at $400 a unit, they are pathetic.  $1600 for four units bought me disappointment, frustration, trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem.  Frankly, the GPS is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes.  You have to stop, remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot...then it happens all over again a few minutes later.  The product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity...You wind up thinking how great it was when you had $20 radios that worked.  I spoke with three Garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem, one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected.  Every seven minutes?  Come on, Windows 95 was more stable than that.  Finally, I got a guy on the phone who said, "Oh yeah, there's a problem with the 530's, you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can.  If not we can send you some more, but I can't make any promises."  He explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the LCD and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution.  Reading the other reviews, I'd guess they've been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now...and through multiple software releases.  I am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair.    I've certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases (Linksys routers for instance, Palm Treo's) but this is no $50 router, (or generally stable $400 phone) and frankly, I have to reset my router once every four months at most.  This product is really bad, I wish it were better because the concept is great, but I would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache. 
 Started the book and put it down as I was not very interest in hearing the author's personal journey as I was interested in learning this style of self defense. The illustartions were too small and the exercise routine was left until chapter nine!!  I however feel that there will be some positives from reading the book 
 this is a little set of five pets that is going outragesly high for forty five dollers!!!!!!!! I saw a set at toys-r-us that had seven pets and it was going for five ninty nine!!!!  toys-r-us did not have any set that expensive unless they came with a playhouse!!!  shop there or at wal-mart or somting, but do not waste you money on this!!!!                            sighned,                              Anne Age 1 
 This book is perfunctory and extremely shallow. Russell's reductive reading of the tradition shows little insight. However, it is amusing at times, hence the star 
 When I had the privilege to study this work under Dr. Stringfellow, I was fed by a true student of the word of God. Dr. Stringfellow made the Bible come alive which made me want continue studying after he completed thre  study. I was able to go through the study a total of three time with this  magnificent man of God. I came out with a great knowledge of the word of  God which led me to further studying of the word of God. I would highly  recommend this study to any student of the word of God.After going through  this study, one can feel blessed by God 
 I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting.  I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good 
 I agree this is not up to par with Joe's best stuff from the 60s and early 70s, but given that, they even left off his best song from this period, "Love Is Alive."  That song really ROCKS and it is not here.  Shame 
 As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.  Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.  Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit... 
 As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who "ruined" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.  Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).  Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see 
 I was a philosophy major in college and I hated this book.  But then again, the whole NAMBLA fic genre really doesn't do it for me.  I'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart, good for them.  I'm incredibly well-read and thought this one was just a tepid bore.  Save your time, read some Dostoevsky, some Dickens, some Milton, (...) 
 To be honest with you I thought the movie was really bad. the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky (Rodney Eastman) was in the movie. (for about 5 mins) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars 
 It is ok for small dogs, large dogs will knock it down 
 I bought this book for my Pre-K class, to go along with our weather unit on Rain. The cover looked so nice I thought it would be a great book. In fact, the illustrations are quite nice; the problem is there's really no story here. The language doesn't flow; its very choppy. The children didn't enjoy this book, and have not asked for it to be read again. Good children's literature should have a story to it: a setting, problem and solution; a definite beginning, middle and ending; and well-defined characters. This book has none of that 
 Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD.  After the "repair" process the entire disk was unplayable.  Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer?  
 The book is set up well with questions to help guide your reading at the beggining of each chapter.  I agree with other posts, that the author doesn;t deal well with the origin of evil. What most concerned me was his compromise of creationism.  He assumes that teh geologic data is correct and therefore wants to make the infallible scripture conform to infallible science, which has changed numerous times over the past several years.  I would not recommend this book at all and would recommend Lectures in Systematic Theology by Theissen instead.  It is an older book but much more reliable.  
 i love to read jackie collins book's and i have liked everyone of them, but for some reason this book is really boaring to me. i expected better. This is book was not as enjoyable to read as her other books, so if this was your first jackie collins book and you didnt like it then i suggest you keep reading because this is her worst 
 Waltz's bourbon-esque treatise is an exploration in alchoholist-influenced social science dementia.  Chapter One is a theoretical bow-tie, an analytical pseurosis of the liver.  Chapter two stumbles forward like a  hurling wino, assumptions swinging wildly like fists through the air.  The  remaining chapters are a blur.  The next morning, you'll have a headach 
 What happened??! I have really been enjoying the Sneaky Pie Brown series - up till now. Found this one to be extremely disappointing and far off the mark for all the characters- they weren't very likeable. Conversations were too preachy and had little or nothing to do with the basic story line. There was very little focus leading up to how the mystery was solved, and  the condition in which the murder victim(s) were found, more graphic than it needed to be.  Ms Brown needs to go back and review her earlier books in this series and refresh her memory on why this series has been so fun to read. Jud 
 This stuff stings when I put it on my face. (No problem for arms, shoulders etc.)  My wife has no problem with it at all.  Everytime my kids put it on, I ask them if it stings and they agree with me that it does.  I have better luck with the Hawaiian Tropic with Parsol. 
 Clearly pretentious (read the introduction and you'll discover that the author writes that the "academy members are primarily craftspeople who don't possess the critical faculties and scholarly approach of cinephiles ..." hummmm), this guy -who pretends to be a cinephile- has preferred to write here a total personal statement, mainly leftist (but sometimes you wonder...), and clearly mean, against the Oscar ceremony,and the people who vote for them and, those who receive the little golden boy(see in example how he prefers to quote only the bad reviews and not one good concerning Braveheart, which made, by the way, a confortable $210,409,945) rather than giving the reader an objective work, written with distance and elegance. Maybe he has never been able to enter the industry he seems to hate so much, and instead of getting an Oscar, prefers to spend time criticizing it with his typing machine, forgetting how much it's easier than... winning an Oscar or doing a movie.

  All I can say is Alice In Chains Rippoffs. These guys make me sick. Don't waste your money, instead buy anything from the great Alice In Chains 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 This book is about as clear as 12 inches of lead when it comes to explaining concepts.  The author spends half of the text on digression bordering on preaching.  Variables are introduced with vague explanations as a rule.  There are tons of equations in this book with little or no explanation.  Terms are regularly defined and then used differently then previously defined.  The organization makes it of absolutely no use as a reference.  If you must buy this book for college, make sure it is in good saleable condition when you're done because keeping it would be stupid 
 I read this book as a part of a Chicano Literature course during my undergrad studies.  While I found the first 140 or so pages okay, I found the overall story a bit boring (educational, but boring).  Lest you think I am being unfair, let me note that the story did pick up again at the end and I do not recall ever having fallen asleep while reading it. (2 stars so far)  I really liked the use of language in creating the voice of the narrator.  It gave me the feeling that I was sitting with an elder aunt or grandmother who was telling the story to me.  (Make it 3 stars, bordering on 4).  So, why the 1 star?  Mainly because I did not like what I interpreted to be a thinly disguised attack on a straw man version of Catholicism and I can't rate it a zero.  I found many of the incidents in the story and especially the commentary of the narrator to be very critical of Catholicism.  I find it unfortunate that, like most critics of Catholicism, Castillo critizes/attacks a straw man version of Catholicism rather than the real thing.  In an interview the author was asked about fact checking in works of fiction (specifically in her book "Massacre of the Dreamers"), Castillo answered:  "No. There isn't any point in it. It's your opinion. It's your reflection, your reaction, your own opinion. When you write a critical -- and this isn't personal essays, these are critical essays -- then you have to prove ever single thing you say."  Maybe that's why she chose to attack a straw man rather than the real thing 
 Having seen the movie once I would definitely say that I will never come back to it again. May be I have overgrown this kind of movies. But still it is more for kids than for adults. It is a disaster if you compare it with the top French comedies with Belmondo, Richard, de Funes, etc 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 This book was a huge dissapointment for me.  I am a stay at home Christian mother of 3.  It is the typical Christian "fluff" that so many publishers and authors are putting out.  I might as well have picked up an arts and crafts holiday book.  I am suprised that focus on the family affiliated themselves with this book 
 As a new student to the field of SQL Server 2005, I was hoping to obtain a book learning the various methods of programming in SQL Server 2005.  I was initially hearted by the first paragraph in the preface:  "You don't need to be an experienced SQL Server 2005 programmer to use this book..."  which is indeed the case if you intend to use it as a paper weight.    The book suspiciously looks like the syntax guide found in most MS products: the procedure name and inputs followed by a description of the inputs.  It is not for the beginner/intermediate learner and is somewhat of a disappointment comming from the O'Reilly range ("SQL on SQL Server 2005" is an excellent counter point to the book being reviewed from the same publisher).  This book serves mainly as a reference (which on page 7, it clearly states that it is not a reference) to new doctrine in the SQL Server evolution.    
 I grabbed this after getting the Raising Chickens book by the same author. Amazon reccomended this book after I purchased the raising chickens bookm and since I planned on building a coop, I figured this information, along with the raising chickens book would be enough. But, much to my dismay, this Bulletin is more of an exerpt of the book. All the same information is covered in a chapter of the book. Don't waste your money on this at all if you get the other book 
 The former New York Giants offensive lineman details --- often too graphically --- his "secret" life ... alleging being raped by a neighbor at age 11; frequent orgies of gin guzzling, Quaalude popping, crack snorting, pot smoking and cocaine freebasing; dressing in drag; prostituting himself for $15 to $20 a pop; stealing and shoplifting and other sundry headline grabbing actions. Think of the tome as a super bowl overflowing with sordid tales from a sordid life --- Simmons swears he was spending $1,000 a day on drugs --- and you'll score a touchdown 
 thank you very much but i will stick with the originals. tribute albums always suck ! Gretchen Wilson cannot be serious. ouch! 
 Gould's '55 recording of the Goldberg variations was a challenging statement from a very young man. Perhaps it needed to be played this way, at least once, or perhaps Gould needed to play it this way at that time.  He thought better of it and re-recorded the work in '82 and it is this last interpretation that will stand the test of time. It is an interpretation that is much closer to the accepted sound, but how beautiful it is! Bach doesn't need eccentric rhythms and tempi to gain attention and it turned out that neither did Gould. You can still hear his vocalise (love it or loathe it - I love it), but the passion, depth and strength of the later work overshadows his earlier effort and nearly everyone else's efforts too. Hear them both and then decide for yourself  RIchard Maycoc

 This book concluded that the examined weaknesses of the Contras  would lead to defeat.  This turned out to be incorrect, since  Contra activity was one of the reasons why Sandinistas were replaced by elections, and a shaky but real democracy.   Such evaluations are common in war for those participating in conflicts tend believe that their enemies are more competent than they really are.  However, there is useful information in this book. 
 The content is full of valuable information on selling. But this Audio CD is not my favourite.   Ziglar speaks so rapidly and non-stop! I guess nobody speaks in this mannner.  I mean, if you want listeners to enjoy your speech, it is better to  speak in a more natural pace, occassionally there should be a pause.    Ziglar is rushing the scripts when you listen to this CD. Choking the brain of the listeners with no respite whatsoever! Slow down Slow down......... Ziglar!  Give me some space to absorb your message!   I wish I can listen to your CD comfortably, but I can't.  You Read the scripts in such a rapid manner that it does not help your listeners to relax and enjoy your works. Ziglar!   I am sorry, I have to give you 2 stars based on your unsatisfactory presentation in this CD 
 Say dear, if you are interested in Sgt. York's life, this book might be just what you are looking for, but if you are curious about the war, I don't recommend it.  A very small portion of the book is given to  discussing Sgt. York's involvement in battle, and the rest is  a rather   painfully detailed account of York raising money for schools.  Though his  cause was always worthy, at times the reading becomes mondane with  financial and political jargon.  The book seems to be worth reading, but  perhaps with a little scanning being done. I believe the best part of  Perry's writing, is simply seeing Sgt. York's character and reading his  charming letters.  Ho, ho.  Only read this book if you are prepared to do a  little perservering to find some gold 
 The title of this book is the giveaway.  Apparently, the author has not read the Constitution FOR the United States of America.  It is NOT the Constitution of the United States of America.  "for" places the Constitution in proper context as the set of rules for the government.  Look for someone who knows that there is no Constitution "of" the United States of America but there is a Constitution "for" the United States of America 
 I am a very happy wife and mother, with fairly conservative views.  As someone who's career is in research, I am disgusted with what others are considering "well researched".  The author has taken facts and twisted to her own advantage, and to the disservice of women.  The "supporting facts" in the book are as comical as the cover.  This author attempts to make a few good points, but then ruins her concepts with overwhelming bias 
 I did not receive this item, altho I  ordered and paid for it. The other 2 items arrived promptly. 
 Poorly written, boring - I got to about page 30 and gave up. Too many GOOD books, too little time. Someone PLEASE tell me how this boring piece of tripe got published 
 When used in the music industry, the term rebirth would indicate erasing the slate and starting anew, and presenting yourself as something different.  Perhaps Jennifer Lopez thought of this knowing that her singing career was in decline, and opted to give her fourth album the title Rebirth.  Is there any legitimate sign of a rebirth on this album, you ask?   A few songs in, and the answer is clearly no.  The songs are still built on synthetic arrangements with synths and samples where real instruments could be, the lyrics are still some of the most shallow you'll ever hear, Lopez still isn't doing much in the way of writing, and her thin voice still sounds the same way it did on her first album.  You would think by now that with all the time that Lopez has spent as a recording artist that some aspects of her output would have improved, but that is not the case.  If the Lopez faithful (who made her first two albums multi-platinum hits) need any proof how weak her voice is, listen to some of the songs here, including the single "Get Right" - she TALKS her way through a lot of these tracks.  That's right, not singing or rapping, but talking.  You have to hear them to know what I mean.  Did you ever stop to think that she doesn't perform live because she can't sing a note in tune?  One thing I'll give her credit for is that at least she isn't taking advantage of her fans by performing "live" concerts while miming the whole thing (like those hacks Britney Spears and Hilary Duff).  The material is so weak that it's little wonder why her fan base has eroded as of late, despite her high profile.  In summary: Not being true to its title, Rebirth is instead a continuation of the weak bubblegum pop and lite R&B sounds that we've come to expect from Jennifer Lopez.  In short, expect more studio-enhanced singing, more synthetic music and more lyrics so weak that even Black Eyed Peas would have rejected them.  You can definitely do better than this album - just don't expect to hear it on the "hit music" station 
 I purchased this product after quite a bit of research and after finding that it was finally available for windows I couldn't wait to get my hands on one.Why wouldn't I? it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread. At first it looked like a really cool product, and is, if your system is a Mac.  Logitech has done a great job of selling the Nulooq to Windows system users but only give you half of the software to operate it on. There is no tooldial for the Windows version ( a fact that they don't disclose ) which is probably the most powerful feature of this product.  I now feel as though I have wasted my money on what is a useless tool ( if you have Windows ) and been totally conned by Logitech. What is even worse is the fact that Logitech don't have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for Window users. So if all you want to be able to do is zoom and scroll then this product is for you....and I know where there is one for sale!!! 
 While I'm not a teen anymore, I still like to watch the occasional movie in this 'genre' (ones that appeal to the tween market) and I do normally like Hilary Duff but this was NOT GOOD.  Hilary was OK in this, but her sister was annoying.  There were the odd funny moments here and there.  The plot was OK (two rich kids lose their money and become broke, yet bounce back into riches again).  It was mostly unbelievable, yet kind of cute if you are of the age that this was intended for.  I think kids would like this, but I found it to be only average 
 There is no information in this book that I haven't read or been told before.  This morning I tried to make one of the recipes from the book, the "Wholesome Whole-Grain Muffins" and they were a disaster.  Behan instructs that this recipe makes 18 muffins, but I used 18 muffin cups and the batter overflowed and made my kitchen smell terrible (not great when a pregnant woman is feeling nauseous anyway) and they are burnt on the edges and not quite cooked in the middles.  This is coming from someone who loves to bake and has a little experience behind making muffins.  The batter was very watery and the small taste I took (what I could stand after smelling burnt batter all morning) was very, very sweet.  I would not recommend purchasing this book 
 I can't believe that I read the same book as some of the other reviewers.  Five stars for THIS book?  I suggest some of you go back and read the classics.  I'm not a former student of PLHS, a teacher, or an administrator.  No, I don't have an ax to grind.  I typically read 3-4 books per month on various subjects that interest me.   This one was painful to read.  The subject interested me.  The book was completely uninteresting.  It represented both students and teachers in the same stereotypical manner that other books about high school have for the past 30 years, except it was written after a national tragedy.  Great time to sell a book written about life in a high school, but what insight does it offer?  Was there something new that the author brought to the table for discussion?  Not in my opinion.  It seemed to me that she chose a cast of characters from this school and tried to create some spin (and a little nostalgia) in order to sell books at a time of heightened interest in high school education.  Well, there's no "news flash" here. And if this author expects me to believe that a woman her age could "integrate" herself into the private happenings of high school teenagers, she is delusional.  The only people who know how teenagers think are other teenagers and possibly their therapists.  The kids who spoke to her -- the "chosen" ones -- were the kids who wanted to get their name in a book.   When someone actually comes up with some true insight about our education system, I'd like to read about it.  If you must read this book, I suggest checking it out at the public library.  You will be wasting your time, but at least you won't be wasting your money 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 I came to this after reading "The Pact," which had its problems too (occasionally cardboard characters/unbelievable situations) but was quite readable overall and kept me awake too late at least one night! This, while the idea was good enough, was a real disappointment. Having Rebecca tell it backwards took away all the suspense, so I was kind of like, who cares? Plus, we didn't really get a sense that Hadley and Rebecca had such a wonderful romance. "show, not tell," is the basic principle of fiction (and non-fiction) writing, yet all of this was just based on Rebecca telling us what a romance it was -- we didn't actually see it. Also, the different voices -- while not a bad idea -- Weren't handled well here. The best way of using different voices is to give you truly new insights into a situation, not to just repeat the same scene twice or even three times. As someone struggling with fiction writing myself, I may be too sensitive, but it seemed that this book should have been structured differently, and perhaps edited more comprehensively, to be truly effective. Jodi has certainly gone on to bigger and better things, which is good to know, but don't start with this one if you want to read her stuff 
 This movie is nothing like the book. In fact it's insulting to true fans. I especially didn't like the implication that Cathy was having Heathcliff's baby. The characters in the book were very bold and highstrung, but not to the point of adultery. Watch the either the original MGM classic or the version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes instead 
 A book in which the author expresses his enjoyment of Jerry Lewis is not a history.  What on earth do his personal likes and dislikes have to do with anything?  This book is written with an almost flippant, name-dropping tone that detracts from the subject matter.  After all, he is talking about Hollywood, not a subject which lacks in flashy self-promotion.  I came away from it less than impressed 
 This book has won the Hugo award and may have had a tremendous impact when it first came out, unfortunately it is now greatly outdated.  While some books hold up better over the course of time, this one did not.  Looking purely at the science involved in the book I'll give Leiber credit for at least thinking of it.  It's a nice premise to theorize the gravitational impact of what would happen to the Earth if a planet the same size as it called, "The Wander" suddenly appeared in space next to it.  He does a decent job covering the effects this would cause to the Earth and the Moon with the changing of the tides, flooding, earth quakes, and volcanic activity, but I think he may have missed the effects that the gravitational pull of Earth would have had on "The Wander" as well.  I also had trouble with several of the characters who seem right out of the 60's.  In the 60's there must have been a great deal of mistrust between the populous and the government and several of the characters reflect this feeling in that, "The Man", or "The Fuzz" are out to get them.   It also appeared that there had been no advances in science on the Earth since the 60's but yet we have a manned base on the Moon and have astronauts out by Mars.  It just didn't add up 
 With Just Rewards, BTB has managed to write the worst book of Woman of Substance series!  Emma's Secret and Unexpected Blessings lacked a certain punch and certainly rewrote the history of the first 3 books.  However, the characters in those 2 books were at least likable.    In this book, Linnet appears to be a unbelievable snob - pretty much turning up her nose at Evan's sisters because they're adopted (People without the noble Harte/Oneil/Kallinski) blood aren't as good as everyone else.  Evan's mother, father, and grandmother love Evan much more than her adopted sisters.  Apparently, Evan's sister was a 'foundling' and has no chance of being as good as a Harte.   Evan is shocked that her father would feel that he is cut out of her life!  However, she allows her 'in-laws' to plan her whole wedding, ends up having a secret ceremony in which she is more concerned that Paula and Shane attend than her own parents.  Paula, who used to be one of the smartest business women in the last 30 years, has all of sudden become one of the dumbest.  In the past, BTB made her heroines a bit too perfect - but at least down to earth.  Now, we're supposed like people that seem to be insensitive snobs.  Also, this certainlly doesn't appear to be the LAST book of the series.. 
 This game is not what it has been hyped up to be. I can't even bother to make it through the first level I found it so stupid. Your character is limited to where they can go, you can't even walk up a slope to get behind the enemy.  The first mounted machine gun I encountered, I could not turn the gun to shoot the enemy behind me.  I stood right in front of the enemy (point blank range)and kept firing yet not one bullet was hitting him.  You can't even kill your own troops; Vetnam and you can't kill your commandor!? Wait a couple years for this game to be ten bucks and then buy it 
 I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good, but I find the gameplay itself less than stellar. For starters, I've always been irritated with games that don't let you save your status whenever you want. Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of gameplay, but that's not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save.  That contributes to the repetitive, tedious nature of some sections. If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game, you're doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again.  I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game. More than in the earlier versions, however, I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task. Another tedious element.  I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun 
 If you want a biased and misleading account of the Arab war against Israel, this ought to satisfy you.  Shlaim tells us that Jabotinsky, in discussing Zionism explained that "if the cause is just, justice must triumph."  I think Jabotinsky made a very good point here.  You see, human beings will, if given the chance, tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in.  The ones who can make best use of the land and wish to do so will be the high bidders for the land.  If injustice consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it (which they will wish to do if they are offered only low prices for it), then it is easy to see what the triumph of justice would mean here.  In particular, it would mean a prosperous Israel and a triumph for Zionism.  Shlaim appears to have missed all this.  To him, Zionism is unjust.  And to him, the triumph of terror and theft is both forthcoming and desirable.  He tells us that a new independent Levantine Arab state "is inevitable."  I disagree.  It may be likely.  But it would serve no purpose.  It would not help Jews, Arabs, or others.  Its only purpose would be to damage Israel.  The people of such a state do not as yet have an independent language, religion, culture, cuisine, or foreign policy.  So I think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here.  Shlaim also tells us that this new Arab state will be "weak, demilitarized, and territorially divided."  Is it just possible that this, if true, provides even more reasons why neither side might want to create it at all?   And could that make the appearance of this state even less inevitable?  Or at least less desirable?    And the author also explains that both sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict will have to make "painful compromises," and that Jerusalem will have to be "the subject of hard bargaining."   Really?  Is having peace and prosperity with reasonable borders a painful compromise?  For either side?  Of course not.  Shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war, poverty, and destruction are somehow less painful.  Had Shlaim been writing about France and Germany, we'd have seen at once that the whole viewpoint is nonsense.  He'd have been telling us that the German National Socialists needed an independent state in France, either to replace all of France or part of it.  He would have laughingly dismissed French claims on the basis of the entire idea of France being unjust!  He'd have sternly explained that a German National Socialist state in France was both desirable and inevitable.  And he would have discussed the necessary "painful compromises" for both sides and the "hard bargaining" about Paris.  There are plenty of reasonable books about the Arab war against Israel.  This isn't one of them 
 Being a big B.C. fan, I could hardly wait to get my hands on her latest. Unfortunately, there is nothing new, and nothing exciting in this cookbook. There are three recipes for broccoli (yes, 3!), a repeat recipe for roasted cherry tomatoes (as if one recipe wasn't enough??), and a recipe for roasted onion quarters to be served as a side dish (yuck!). These examples were definitely the low-lights for me, but as I flipped through the cookbook, there was nothing that jumped out at me. I was completely underwhelmed. To end on a positive, it is a pretty book 
 This product was only good for about 1 week.  The inner light went out and that makes it very difficult to see. I have written to the company I purchased from, asking them to exchange it and I have yet to receive a response. I'm out the $59.95 I paid for it, plus tax and shipping. It was a birthday present for my fiancee and I am extremey dissappointed and thinking about filing charges against Fine Things II for stealing my money. 
 I couldnt even get past the first chapter without stopping for a few days before I started again. And when i did continue to read it didn't get any better. As a matter of fact it got worst. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone else. I'd rather watch mariah careys GLITTER 
 As I recall, 1967 was not the most prolific year for movies and Point Blank,in my opinion, would be one of the worst films I have ever watched.  Notwithstanding the very violent nature of the film, the acting by such notables as Lee Marvin, Carroll O'Conner and Angie Dickinson continually appear to search for conviction with their dis-jointed and nonsensical dialogue. Flashbacks, San Quentin, the San Francisco skyline cannot save this film from the trash heap of celluloid history. If your a Lee Marvin fan, better to watch "The man who shot Libery Valance" twice, than waste your time on Point Blank. Your disposition will be better for it 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 .............Is not functional................ . If you are reading this then you are Gump-y! And, you and I must be family.  First, I love Amazon; they are the consistent type of e-merchant.  And that's good! But but but but, why?:  would a designated (by me) upper "echelon" merchant like Amazon carry this Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). It simply is not functional information that I stored Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is gone, or not readable. I am surprised that Amazon did not catch-on/up with the problem.  The product won't retain any info then I had to store less and less information on the card, so that my info is able to stay on the card another 6 hours. I decided to contact Amazon, they were very shortly, and cordially sent me a replacement Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), with the paperwork for returning the original Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768).  Then I got something that:  A.	Did, have the shape of a 2gig Sandisk CF card;  B.	Did, have the Sandisk label that says Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768)......;  C.	And did have the original shiny factory Sandisk package. None-being the-less 3 different computers later and 2 hour had passed couldn't recognize what is inserted into the CF reader.  D.	The brand new replacement card I got with the original factory wrapping, that's brand new and untouched and unrecognized by computers. One may safely assume (pardon the facetiousness), Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), is yet to be recognized.   From Amazon, twice in the mail, I got a Sandisk 2 GB compact which flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). Both cards I received had a problem. And therefore, it is safe to assume that Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) production have a major glitch. I mean, the memory card cannot be used for memory purposes. I have to yet see what or for what, other than memory, can I utilize a memory card. I beg your pardon, but in essence I am trying to imply that... The Sandisk products were a joke! :-).  Being the consistent e-merchant that Amazon always been, Amazon agreed to return them. This was not a surprise (coming from Amazon).  In essence, I strongly urge any person that makes a living, and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to: 1.	Not be fooled. If you see Sandisk, run away as fast as possible,  2.	You'll lose it all in a matter of a day or so.  3.	Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is not compatible with data storage! or even short transfers of data, from a home computer to work. 4.

 I got this book from the library and was reading it with my daughter. The illustrations are wonderful and overall it is a good introductory to evolution for kids. However I find it unbelieveable that the author describes the appearance of the primate/human "common ancestor" as being descended from apes. For someone who thinks himself knowlegable enough to be writing educational books for any age on the theory of evolution this "mistake" is unforgivable.  Considering the idea is the most repeated falsity used by ignorant opponents of evolution. You are not helping to educate children by feeding them ignorance. It`s enough to keep me from reading anything else written by this author 
 Marcus Borg may be the most reasonable member of the Jesus Seminar. His books on the "historical Jesus," while I think deeply mistaken (as I explain in my book, Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could), do demonstrate intelligence, learning, and often worthwhile insight into one of the traditions he compares in this book. Since he does not claim to be a Buddha scholar, it might seem reasonable to cut him some slack. After all, many of the quotes he gives from Jesus and Buddha do sound similiar. And there is no denying either the charm of Borg's gentle approach, or of many of the quotes themselves.   However, Borg's approach is amateurish and naive, making his conclusions deeply misleading.   To begin with, Borg stacks the deck. He does not compare Buddha's teachings on the evils of making love to one's wife (in the sutra called "Defeat") with similar passages from Jesus, or Jesus' confrontations with political critics with similar problems encountered by Buddha, because such parallels do not exist. Borg only selects points that enhance his argument. But Borg admits that, so perhaps we can let it slide.   More seriously, really Borg does not compare Jesus and Buddha at all. He compares a whittled-down selection of Jesus sayings, written within a few short years of the Master's life, with a vast library of Buddha material written by all kinds of people over several hundred years. At one point he says, "One might even say that becoming a bodhisattva is the goal of the fully developed Christian life." Never mind that this Mahayana concept only appeared half a millennia after Buddha! Such comparisons are worse than meaningless. If I sifted 150 years of Marxist tradition, I could easily find sayings that parallel passages in the Gospels -- but setting them side by side would not mean that the real Marx taught his disciples to turn the other cheek.   Why does Borg not compare the historical Jesus to the historical Buddha? The real reason, aside from the fact that he is admittedly an "amateur" on Buddha, may be that our earliest sources are too remote from Siddhartha to be sure what he was like. In the Dharmapadda, Buddha appears as a kind, gentle thinker like the present Dalai Lama. In other sutras, he is a hippy who leaves home in search of a better commune. Elsewhere he brags like the vain Bagwan Rajneesh: "I am the Tathagata, the teacher of gods and men, omniscient and endowed with all powers." The various Buddha materials do not come from the same century, let alone the same man. Borg is trying to clap pretty solid historical materials (Jesus in the Gospels) against empty air (sutras that do not in fact come from Buddha at all).   The critic who replies that the ministry of Buddha was longer, so more materials would be available for his life, is just missing the point. After a few centuries of oral tradition and free creation of new sutras, in a culture that did not (like the Jews or Chinese) emphasize historicity, it is hard to figure out from the resulting libaries of material what Buddha actually said, or even was. The same is simply not the case with 1st Century writings by Jewish followers of Jesus, written within the natural life-spans of his first disciples, that show strong internal and external markings of basic historical accuracy. (As even the JS often admits.)   Thirdly, some of the parallels here seem to owe more to similarity of wording than intent. While the Gospel may call a Christian to "hate" his family in the sense of putting God first, Jesus' early disciples do not seem to have left spouse or offspring, as Buddha taught his disciples to do. By "salvation" Buddha means freedom from rebirth, while Jesus means a new birth from Heaven.   What is left of these parallels? Probably "compassion" was important both to Jesus and to Buddha. But from the 1st Century, Christians have not only admitted, but insisted, that moral truth, what C. S. Lewis called the "tao" (following Confucius), is universal. Of course Buddha taught kindness; what else would anyone with a conscience teach? But such a beautiful source of Buddhist compassion as the Dharmapadda contains no hint that Buddha did any miracles. There is little historical evidence that he was a "person of the spirit" in that sense.  Several reviewers say this book is not for scholars. Actually, some of the quotes in it may intrigue anyone. But no one with integrity, scholar or layman, should read too much into such forced parallels.   Marcus Borg ought to know better. His arguments about  "people of the spirit" should rest on serious scholarship. In a sense, though, Borg does truth a service, by showing how far afield one needs to go to find parallels to the Gospel story, and how weak those parallels prove, when tested critically. 
 This product was a waste of good money.  It doesn't even work to control frizz as promised.  The curls are limp and after about an hour or so, there is a lot of frizz.  I would not buy this product again 
 I think that this is a classic example of the problems with alternative punishments.  Not that I wouldn't like to see vast improvements in how we handle prisoners, but this is a prize example of the arrogance of untested theory.   With the vague half-vast planning that attends so many vast ideas, Menninger pompously assured us that "men of science" would solve all our problems.   The statistics that I have read don't bear this out.   Psychologist are USUALLY wrong in predicting whether or not a released prisoner will later become violent.  It almost seemed a little cruel reading this book.   Menninger praises indeterminate sentencing at our Patuxent Institute here in Maryland as the shining light beckoning to the future proper criminal justice.   Crime was a social sickness, and should be handled by doctors, who would know when people could be released.   In the mid-70s, the same people who had mouthed these sentiments were denouncing Patuxent as cruel, indeterminate sentences as monstrous.   I may not have the figures for the prize case absolutely correct, but in the ballpark, a man had spent 19 years in Patuxent for an auto theft; he would have served about 18 months in prison.  Apparently, the good doctors are competent to release someone, but not to hold them.  The aforementioned man, after all, wasn't supposed to be undergoing punishment but treatment.   Supposedly, he was suffering from a disease as real as any physical ailment and his anti-social behavior arose from a real inability to control his own behavior.   Stealing the car was merely a symptom of this illness, not evidence of its severity.  If we are supposed to believe that psychprofessionals can tell us that it is safe to release someone, they should be able to tell us when it is not, and we should therefore believe that the above-mentioned prisoner was not yet fit to be released and presumably would have committed more crimes and been re-arrested.  But, indeterminant sentencing was modifed so that no-one could be held at Patuxent longer then they would have been held in prison, so the Institute began to specialize in particularly grim crimes, usually exceptionally ghastly murders.   Concerns about the goal of returning these people to society caused an embattled administrator to complain because people wanted Patuxent to deal with people guilt of lesser crimes (like car theft?).  She complained that such were often more difficult to treat than the extremely violent.  So there we have it - if treating people as mentally ill has no better result than treating them as willfully irresponsible, shouldn't we simply go for the cheaper system?  Or are we simply to accept criminal behavior as the just punishment of us as a society for failing to meet to social needs, effectively abolishing the idea of crime and take no coercive steps to control it?  Are we really sure that we have only to choose to take better care of our citizens to ensure that no-one will be traumatized into antisocial behavior?  In all situations, I believe that it is a given that we could do better, indeed standards of what constitute an adequate job are always changing, but will it really eliminate all our problems?  The problem is that people cannot seem to make up their minds whether most people should be held accountable for their actions or not.   The present system assumes that in most cases they can, and that punishment is intended to make them decide that the possibilities of the crime aren't worth the risk of prison.   "Crime as a disease" assume that they cannot be held accountable, but most people still want to retain legal structures and protections intended for the former case - a real dog's dinner of a system.  Maybe one day, crime can really be handled in a rational way, based upon meaningful research.   For now, it seems to remain a clash of egos and insufficiently supported philosophies 
 Being a day late and a dollar short, I finally decided to buy this book despite the poor reviews.  I could not get past the introduction by Lestat (Anne) saying how stupid we all are for "not getting" his/her previous book".  She/he failed to explain what exactly it was that we were supposed to get, to my satisfaction anyway. AND the religious aspect of it all...... well I will keep my own council on that issue.   My theory regarding Anne's later efforts is (please do not take offence Ms. Rice) that Anne lost her edge after her beloved husband died.  Could it be that he had some part (a large one)in her previous novels?  The beautiful prose is gone from her writing and I think as her writing deteriorated, her ego grew.   All I can say is - Anne, stop writing, retire, open a doll hospital or be a spokesperson for charity. Kick back, bake cookies enjoy your life, just please do not torture us with any more writing.   
 I've seen and heard Sheryl live when she's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs.  She's great - she's hip, self-assured and kicks butt!  But here, she tells the audience in "Leaving Las Vegas":  "I'm playing Central Park tonight... but I have some friends coming up so can you be patient...Please? For lil' ol' me? Be very patient...." almost begging the audience not to walk out while she's singing solo.  It's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the "friends" arrive.  The irony is that Sheryl solo is the best part of the album.   With the others on board, we can't see what Sheryl can do, and those familiar with her know that Sheryl is capable of a lot.   She's overwhelmed by Keith Richard, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Chrissie Hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature.  Her songs "It Don't Hurt" and "There Goes the Neighborhood" stand out on the album showing that Sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her "friends." Too bad she didn't include "Am I Getting Through" -- the Part 2 of that was a great rock moment.  Natalie Maines' grating voice (like fingernails on a chalkboard) completely ruin "Strong Enough."  Chrissie sounds like a zombie on "If It Makes You Happy", Sarah McLaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her Lilith-Fair mode that she adds nothing to "A Difficult Kind"...in fact, by the end of the song Sarah seems to disappear from the song as Sheryl belts it to the end.  That's Sheryl's song and should remain so,  Tombstone Blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of "All I Wanna Do" is the New York audience.  Happy, White Room and Gold Dust Woman are three classic rock standards, so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70's FM AOR radio has heard them ad nauseaum.  Problem here is that nothing new is added to them, they sound like karaoke versions.  Despite Sheryl's plea for patience, I was bored with the old-timers.They didn't bring Sheryl's career forward, only backwards 
 I wouldn't bother spending money on this book. It reads too much like a brochure. The author spent the majority of her time talking about the Innkeepers and not the Inns. Not only that, but she didn't rate the Inns,  so it was hard to tell which Inns were good and which were bad. I wound up  returning this book and purchasing "The Unofficial Guide to Bed and  Breakfasts in New England" by Lea Lane. It's a much better book. The  author visited each Inn personally and then gave a thorough review. She  also rated the Inns.  She did not accept any payment from the Inns for  inclusion in the book which meant she was able to write an unbiased review 
 I originally planned to purchase Locin floss to replace the DenTek, but I'm not too pleased with it so far.  PLUSES ======= -Each individually wrapped floss. -Doesn't contain floride.  MINUSES ======= -Flimpsy handle--almost not usable. -Wrap is not 100% sealed. -flossing head is shallower and narrower than the DenTek 
   Cheb I Sabbah seems like a really interesting guy. He was born in Algeria, moved to France with his family in the early sixties and ended up in Berkeley in 1968. He was totally into the hippie scene, with a girlfriend who had dated Neal Casady and made acid with Owsley, the Grateful Dead's chemist and soundman. So why do I find this CD so...BORING? It seems to lack the urgency of the other North African music I love (Ali Hassan Kuban, Abdel Aziz El Mubarek, Khaled, Idir, or even other North African ex-pats like The Orchestre National Des Barbes). Adbel Aziz El Mubarek swings more, Ali Hassan Kuban has better rhythms, Khaled is better than any of these singers and Idir has better melodies.    If you are thinking of buying this, LISTEN TO IT FIRST, if possible. The only option on Amazon might be hearing short samples, which doesn't really help much, I'm afraid. I am a big fan of the Beat magazine, and most of their columnists RAVED about this disc so I bought it. It just simply doesn't move me anywhere near as much as other North African music I have. Believe me, I WANT TO LIKE IT. After all I bought it at Tower Records here in Osaka and it wasn't cheap, but after trying and trying to get into it, I give up.    Want a great compilation of new North african music? I recommend Tea in Marrakech.  Edited to add: I just realized that the one song I kinda like (track seven "Im Ninalou") was performed by Ofra Haza on her album Seven Gates of Wisdom (ages ago), and her mostly acoustic version was better, to my ears.            
 I hate the fact that this "group" has "made it" simply because some a-hole at the record company never heard of "Massive Attack." I swear I gave this album a good-hard listen: just me and a pair of headphones hoping for something new.  What I heard was a girl who has a good voice, but lends that voice to some of the dumbest recycled lyrics that I keep hearing over and over on the radio. (now, the radio isn't bad, but aren't you tired of hearing the same lyrics re-arranged to a different peice of music?) It also wouldn't be so bad if I didn't already love Massive Attack and never heard of them. SERIOUSLY go listen to "Mezzanine" From Massive Attack and tell me that Evanescence isn't HEAVILY influenced and to a point copying them. Don't just rip my review just because "I LOVE THAT SONG THEY PLAY ON THE RADIO" go get Mezzanine, sit in a dark room and just listen. You'll see that I'm right. also, the album cover? please. come up with graphics, or something. I hate ego maniacs that put their damn face all over their cover. 
 i wanted this dvd because i wanted to be scared and i like the ideas of haunted house, honestly this movie was a joke yes it had a story but effects were terrible there was nothing scary about it you could tell that all the bodys and heads and arms that were being hacked off were fake.  i wish i could get my money back id rather go with psyco , motherday,the omen amityvill horroe the excoris 
 This is a book by JA Jance?  This book took a potentially good storyline (plot) and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style, which is UNLIKE JA Jance.  This book seemed to be to be written for a young-adult reader audience.   I had to force myself to read it all the way through because I must admit, I was curious as to the conclusion, but I did not derive any pleasure from reading this book.  A waste of time 
 This book has alot of "feel good" inserted in it. I was disappointed in it.  I bought it to give to my daughters and daughter-in-law, but changed my mind when I read it. It strayed from the Biblical view 
 Joanna Weaver, the author of "Having a Mary Spirit", also wrote "Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World."  She has a unique way of reaching out to women with total clarity.  She reveals her own struggles and we all can identify with what she has experienced. There is also a touch of humor throughout.        We all want to improve our lives, to grow closer to God.  This book is a great little manual for doing so.  I highly recommend it, as it will surely change your life.   
 To be honest, I borrowed this book from a public library because the bad experience from its precedessor The Innergame of Trading had deterred me from wasting my hard earned money on this.   For detailed review please see my review of the Innergame of Trading because the two books are so similar, of very low value and repeating the same basic trading psychology stuff like a successful trader got to have discipline, focus, bravery to cut loss short and let profit ride blah blah blah, except that the interview part in Outer is about 100 page longer than that in Inner. (160 vs 60) However, the quality of the interview content is even lower.   I really cannot agree what the authors claimed on the book cover that their book helped the readers to model the trading strategies of Today's Market Wizards. How? Just by going through the lines of the interview. I am afraid that's more diffcult than achieving a 6 month winning streak 
 Young Nicole has decided to run away from her Texas home with her equally young boyfriend, Jess.  Their plan?  Drive to Hollywood and seek gainful employment as Famous Movie Stars.  This one fact explains much that is wrong about the film.  Not only does it immediately make the characters hard to care about, but it also foreshadows one of their biggest and most boring flaws: mind-blowing stupidity.  Nicole, at one point, hears the call of nature, and the two ill-fated young lovers stop at (dum da dum!) the Rest Stop.  After Nicole uses perhaps the most nauseating toilet in southwest America, she comes outside to find that her boyfriend and his car have disappeared.  Before long, she is tormented by a sadistic man in a yellow truck, an odd-ball family of fundamentalist God-thumpers, and her own crippling idiocy.  To save herself, Nicole drinks an ancient bottle of liquor, watches a little T.V., cries morosely, and spends about 18 hours in the Bathroom-o'-Ba'al.  Jaimie Alexander's Nicole does nothing that could be called intriguing or understandable, and (double whammy) she is horribly, horribly acted.  Penned and directed by John Shiban, "Rest Stop" has literally nothing going for it.  Considering that Shiban is a veteran "X-files" scribe, the incomprehensible plot is forgiveable (I'll grant, while I'm on the subject, that various scenes given during the credits and on the disc's special features help "clear up" the ludicrous story, but I'll also say that if you have to employ extras in order to give your movie clarity, then there's something wrong).  But everything else -- the disbelieving cop, the mysterious video, the school bus -- well, it's all about as interesting and creative as the scribbles on your typical public toilet stall 
 This is a mindless book with no substance.  It is amazing how people can make money selling such meaningless nonesense.  This material is not original...just a bunch of quotes.  This is not at all helpful for customer service.  Dont waste your money 
 I am sure Terri Jean is a well-meaning person. But this is the kind of book that makes native people throw up.  It tries to sell our spirituality for a profit.  She doesn't have any real understanding of anything other than a spiritual hunger and a desire to make money.  I am ashamed of this book 
 The book only had a few tips and most of the tips aren't very useful.  I think a better purchase would have been the Stacey and Clinton book 
 Today I went and saw the overly hyped 'Saw 3'. You know, the poster with the teeth being hung by a rope?  First of all, on a positive note, I will say that the 'Saw' trilogy is the best horror trilogy around apart from 'Final Destination' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. One thing all of these movies have in common is creativity when it comes to torturing, playing with, and eventually killing their victims. There's no evil curse which infects anyone who enters a certain part of the woods, there's no supernatural crap at all. Unless you could call 'Final Destination' a supernatural force, but it's actually meant to be fate that causes their death, not a being. I saw the first 'Saw' a while ago now. It was quite an enjoyable watch. Two men trapped in a bathroom taking part in all of Saw's games. It was much better than the 2nd version which was just too much like the movie 'The Cube', plus the scene where the girl falls into a whole pool full of needles which then draws blood up into all of them, leaving her weaker and weaker was just too nauseating. Same with this 'Saw 3' - I never turn away from the head splattering scenes filled with blood, but bring a needle about to go into someone's skin, and my eyes will close voluntarily. Strange huh? 'Saw 3' was just more of the same. The same sort of head contraptions but less of the suspense and build up. A man with a chain around his foot that he has to get out of, wait, haven't we seen this before? Sure, there are some new methods of death including being frozen inside a freezer etc, but the deaths are timed to minutes and they either live or die and then the scene just goes to the next person waiting for their fate. The only people who are allowed to have more time than just one minute is a man and a woman (won't tell you who they are though, it'll be a surprise for those who watch) who have little personality, and are shown to be moral and decent human beings because of a couple of things they do within the film: one being the man saving another man from certain death even though technically because of the man's actions in the past, he could have let him suffer and die, and the girl trying to keep Saw alive (because if she doesn't she will die herself). This movie tries to be some sort of 'learning about life' psychological thriller but just seems to come off as a bit lame. And the crazy sidekicks who spray off rants of shouting and unneeded swearing always seem like they're just 'acting' (which they are) but you're supposed to follow them as if you're right there, they seem like scared bunny rabbits sometimes... 'Saw' being shown as what he really is, a psychopathic brutal killer would be enough without all of his head games and ridiculous 'insights' into life. Then again, this is what makes the series original I guess... And of course the 'let's reveal all our secrets' technique for these mindwarping? thrillers where they wrap everything up and let everyone know how each other the characters got to the point they were at. For fans of blood and guts, you should seriously buy a ticket to this, there's plenty.  Fans of substance and a real point should look elsewhere. In fact, parts are quite boring even though the film never stops trying to take the audience into a place they would fear more than death. Watching the main woman character who has the head device on, and thinking how much she looks like Theresa Fitzgerald from the soap opera 'Passions' doesn't help either. Watch with caution. You'll either love or hate this movie. For horror fans, you'll just be kind of like 'meh' 
 Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.   I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.   The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time 
 Saddam Hussein has posed the United Nations (U.N.) with its greatest test since the Korean War. Security Council Resolution 687 may have mandated that Iraq eliminate its chemical and biological weapons programs and curtail its ballistic missile capability, but Saddam has treated U.N. weapons inspections with disdain, routinely preventing full, unfettered access, and finally, in 1998, refusing to comply altogether.  Deaver, academic coordinator at the Civic Education Project in Russia, correctly identifies international diplomacy's failure to limit Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program as worthy of study. Rather than analyze the history of the inspections regime or detail the U.N. Special Commission's success and failure, however, he examines power relationships, resistance, and the applicability of academic theory.  Disarming Iraq begins with a succinct overview of Iraq's weapons programs and the international response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (though his summary does little more than regurgitate Anthony Cordesman's uneven work). However, some of Deaver's subsequent speculation is curious. Who outside the sheltered world of academe would state that Saddam objected to chemical and biological weapons disarmament out of fear of being left defenseless in a tough neighborhood? (The Iraqi army retained its sizeable conventional forces and those ballistic missiles with under 150-kilometer range.)  Deaver then examines the monitoring duel between Iraq and the U.N., relying almost entirely on U.N. documents and granting them a legitimacy possible only from someone who has never observed U.N. fieldwork firsthand. Analyzing U.N. monitoring in isolation, Deaver fails to consider how the U.N.'s willingness to compromise encouraged Saddam's widespread obstruction. For example, in May 1996, the U.N. and Baghdad agreed to a memorandum of understanding diluting the substance of Security Council resolutions to enable the oil-for-food program. Iraqis who I interviewed repeatedly pointed out that if the U.N. responds to Saddam's obstruction by reducing his obligations, then Saddam will simply increase obstruction with regard to the weapons program the U.N. holds most dear.  Also missing in Deaver's study is any attention to Saddam's trade politics. It is no secret that Saddam directed billions of dollars in oil-for-food contracts to France, Russia, and key Arab states in exchange for Paris, Moscow, Cairo, and Damascus turning a blind eye to unrestrained erosion in sanctions.  Disarming Iraq is an example of academic self-absorption that provides little satisfaction to real-world international relations practitioners. It illustrates the growing schism between university and practical politics. Theory should never substitute for on-the-ground research.  Middle East Quarterly, Winter 200 
 This review book was assigned to my senior ultrasound program in our last quarter of classes.  A colleague of mine who is a radiologic technologist had used the A&L RT review book and found it helpful, so my expectations when it was assigned were to be able to learn and to have a good array of review questions.  However, this book seems to be a compendium of outdated information rife with typos that would be hilarious if they were not so frequent.  I am finding that working through it is about a 75% waste of time.  Who edited this?....  Anyone?......  Anyone?   Another problem is that images are labeled wrong, or not labeled (e.g.:  "Name the structure with the arrow on example 5-113," and then there is no arrow.  Or worse, the arrow clearly, unmistakably points to the aorta and the answer is IVC.).  The OB/GYN chapters are better than the physics and abdomen chapters; the latter have significant errors in them.  My biggest problem is that as a whole these questions require very little critical thinking and are not "pitched" at a level commensurate with what I believe the ARDMS registries require (I will update this review after taking my registries in Mar.-April).  And now, for amusement value, some of the misprints:  "posterior urethral values" for intussusception, "intersuppection" "pleura effusion" --- and the list goes on.   For review I would recommend the following books:  Physics:   Physical Principles of General and Vascular Ultrasonography, Jim Baun, BA, RVT, RDMS  http://www.jimbaun.com/jimbaunjan05_007.htm  Understanding Ultrasound Physics, Sidney Edelman, 2nd Edition  Abdomen:    Exam Preparation for Diagnostic Ultrasound, Sanderson/Dolk/Miner  Abdomen & OB/GYN:  Clinical Guide to Ultrasound, Charlotte Hennigsen 
 Study an atlas before you go into lab.  You can figure out how to dissect almost everything without a dissector.  If you get stuck, ask a professor, but reference this book only as a last resort.  There are MUCH better ways of accessing certain structures than the instructions in this book.  There is absolutely no reason to have your own personal copy.  The one plus about this edition is that references to other atlases besides Grant's (terrible) are given 
 I did not find this book to have any "solutions." It was simply the usual self-help book which never goes to the root of any problem 
 In theory, a great book, in practice-don't waste your mone 
 Why is the title "A Do Right Man"?  I didn't get it.  What was so do right about Bobby Dallas?  He was the typical black man IMO.  He ended up with a great job and salary and only THEN did he decide that HE was ready to settle down and Faye was supposed to be with it.  NOT!    He played a couple of different women, was dishonest, and less than "right".   I only finished the book because I spent my hard owned money on it.  This book was ENTIRELY too slow.  It's like, please get to the point Omar Tyree.  After this, I believe I am finished supporting him and his less than stellar novels.  I only wish that I hadn't spent money on a black man writing about how hard it is for another black man out there in the dating and professional world when I can get that same sob story at any local hangout.  SAVE IT and SAVE YOUR MONEY!  
 As a psychology minor, I think Matlin does a wonderfully thorough job of covering cognition.  However, as an English major, I find her style of writing irritatingly repetitive, and much more confusing than it needs to be.  She uses a lot of examples to define concepts, rather than stating them--which would be very helpful. Furthermore, the glossary does absolutely nothing to help the confused student, since it basically reprints the in-text sentence where the vocabulary word appears. I would recommend sending the book to a literary editor who could redo the text 
 I LOVED what the CD had to say but the sound quality could have been a little better 
 I bought this book after hearing the author talk on C-Span "Book  Notes".  She seemed intelligent and well-spoken. I was surprised to find her writing was not up to her oratory.  The book reminded me of term papers written by high school students- occasional flashes of insight, never properly developed, surrounded by uninspired verbiage. Chapters were subdivided into alternate views: "Winston Churchill Was Well Suited to High Office" and "Winston Churchill Was Ill Suited to High Office".  After only a few paragraphs, the section would end with   lines right out of high school debate class "It was for these qualities that Churchill was hailed as the savior of his country," or "Because of these qualities, Churchill was an irresponsible and erratic leader."  The only redeeming quality is the character of Churchill, that manages to still come through despite the very immature style of writing 
 Why do they keep making these "Mozart (and other composers) for..." CDs? I know I know. For idiots to buy them of course so the record company can make tons of money. But I feel it's an insult to classical music. No offense but Mozart wasn't thinking of you sipping a cup of joe when he wrote this music. He couldn't care less "how perky" your Starbucks is to tell you the truth. I think he'd be pretty mad seeing how his music is being commercially exploited these days. Why can't people just buy and listen to classical music as it was intended? Buy a set of Mozart's violin concertos or maybe Don Giovanni if you're so inclined. Don't be afraid - Mozart didn't write anything less than great. You won't be disappointed even if you go out on a limb and even buy one of his lesser known works. But don't get this "potpourri excerpts from his music" trash. Gosh, these kinds of CDs have gone too far. What's next - "Tchaikovsky for Taking a Dump"? Sheeesh....Don't suport this if you care about preserving art.. 
 		Although the premise of this book is brilliant, perceptive and absolutely vital to the next few years;  Reich sadly presents an incisive example of the economic thinking and progress that made Democrats relevant in the 1930s.  	It's years ahead of the Bush ideologues, who act and think as if the 20th Century never happened.  Reich is progressive enough to adopt the policies of the 1930s, and he does exceptionally well.  He knows how to blow an eloquent "toot" on the whistle of a charming old steam locomotive;  like many other politicians of nostalgia, he thinks it gives him the right to fly the Space Shuttle.  	The world is changing.  As an example, Wal-Mart can forecast with 5 percent accuracy how many copies of a new video disc it will sell, and it has that figure within four hours of the disc going on sale.  That's where the brains of Wal-Mart is located, and it's why the company needs only $10-an-hour clerks for the check-out counter and to stuff the shelves.  	When check-out counters were complicated, it made sense to hire $20-an-hour clerks.  Now the job involves holding a bar code in front of a laser scanner, it has become another job where many companies could use "los barratos illegales".  	No one has a "right" to a specific job;  work must be earned by those who acquire the necessary skills.  Fifty years ago, it made sense that American auto workers were the best paid in the world, their assembly work required skill.  Today, truly skilled jobs are done by robots;  assembly workers do low skill work that is too menial to be automated.  	Success today depends on the desire to learn technical and personal skills needed for a specific job. Sadly, too many people have VW "Bug" skills and Escalade attitudes.  Sorry, life isn't like that any more.  	Let's do some numbers:  there are about 190 million Americans in the labour force, plus 10 million unemployed;  at least 10 million illegal aliens have jobs here.  If Reich is right, then how can millions of illegal migrants with about a Grade 3 formal education get jobs that Americans with high school diplomas can't hold?  Instead, every illegal migrant with a job is another proof that Reich is outdated.  	Reich completely ignores this issue;  instead, he offers Depression-era solutions for the future knowledge economy.  There's a good business reason why there are millions of illegal migrants in America, and why no administration will take action against them.  Reich, as a former Secretary of Labour, should address that issue.  	The future is ahead.  Americans deserve a better than going back to the 1930s with Reich's liberal allies,  or back to the 1890s with Bush's conservatives of greed, cronyism, graft and war.  This book shows Reich would have been a great Labour secretary for Franklin Roosevelt, but he was merely a seat warmer in the 1990s.  	Please, we're all going to live in the future.  So, let's think about the future, instead of resurrecting colorful but antiquated policies of the past.  Reich should do much better, or else we'll all be Bushwhacked by the sultans of greedy-nomics.  
 type smudges / translation bad / in short, a disposable boo 
 Another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation... If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers. like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it.... It is a living. When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc.... I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad... 
 Leavitt's fans may remember an episode a few years back where he was accused of plagiarizing another man's work.   I read "Jonah Boyd" and found it a decent read. On the same day I returned "Boyd" to the library, I checked out a book by Robert Grudin, titled "Book: A Novel", which predates "Boyd" by several years. After reading "Book" (which, by the way, is a great story), several similarities between the two were obvious, and not likely the result of coincidence. Maybe it's not plagiarism, but as Leavitt's prior accuser said, the least Leavitt could have done is attribute the source of the material in an acknowlegement.   Here's the things I noted: 1. Both books feature writer/professor characters caught up in university departmental politics. 2. Both books feature a primary character attempting, unsuccessfully, to round up all the published copies of another writer's work.  3. In "Boyd" streets in the university town are named by combining the first part of one state with the last part of another state. (Florilina might be a street name in "Boyd"). In "Book", the states themselves (and the state universities) have names like Washagon, or Missibama, using the same splice technique.  4. The typeface in both books is Sabon, and both have very similar "About the type" entries at the end of the book.   Here's what I think: Leavitt read "Book", and liked it so much he decided to appropriate certain things into a book of his own. Obviously this isn't plagiarism, but it sure looks like unacknowleged copy-catting to me.   
 I am the type of person that ALWAYS buys the extra warranty on whatever I purchase.  However, I started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still hadn't received their refund check.  I was astonished.  I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this.  With no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps, I was informed that if I did everything by email, it would take AT LEAST 15 business days (that's three weeks!) to receive my refund check AFTER I sent them the warrantied item.  If I had them send me a pre-paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer, it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item.  In other words, it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks!  I cancelled the contract immediately.  It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract.  I would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as Grado, Sennheiser or Koss.  But stay away from these people; that's my feeling and my advice.  
 Dang, Carl, how could you?  Let me start by saying that CH is one of my favorite writers.  His stories aren't necessarily epic in nature but his dialog & characterizations & writing in general are virtually beyond reproach.  Even though his storylines border on slice-of-life rather than edge-of-your-seat thrillers, Hiaasen's writing is typically so good, his books are still extremely entertaining page-turners.  That said, Native Tongue was quite a letdown for me.  Usually I'll finish a book like this in one or two days.  I struggled for almost two weeks to finish it, putting it down at the drop of a hat.  In his defense, this was one of Hiaasen's earlier efforts.  Everything since Native Tongue has been infinitely better.  If you're new to Hiaasen, don't let this book turn you off.  His other works are definitely worth reading 
 Aye.... no, no, no. I had great expectations from this cd. I thought that it would be as good as    "ADIEMUS", but I was wrong. It is less lively and much less melodic. I expected choir chants and powerful medieval  music, but what I got was an amorphous mixture of sounds. Do yourself a  favor, buy ADIEMUS, and not DANCES OF TIME 
 Reader Beware! As of December 13, 2004, the author of this book, Fr. Roger Haight has been forbidden to teach or present himself as a Catholic Theologian.  This book has been condemed by the church for teaching doctornal error regarding Christ and redemption. The condemntation of this book and its auther came from Cardinal Ratzinger with approval of its condemnation by the pope on Dec 13, 2004. 
 As I read this book, what became evident was that his story was an eloquent rendering of deep stage alcoholism and drug addiction and that his depression was not the cause of those things, but a result of those things.  Pity that the author doesn't arrive at this understanding, as it may have helped him.  
 Pat Robinson sounds like a cult leader with his "our one true God", not only is he a hypocrite and an absolute bigot, he thinks liberals are all baby-killing, teen emancipating, thief consenting and emybro disecting freaks! Does he expect all 'pure' christians to sit church and read the bible all their damn life? This is the 21st century, none of these holier than thou concepts of living is feasible in this day and age is he kidding? are we all just an great dissapointment to God because we arnt like the rightous Pat Robinson? he is an agitator and too blind with his own hypocricy to even discern what is of God and what isnt 
 Queen stands as one of the most important acts in rock and metal, not only deserving of praise an adoration, but also their music is, in its original form, should continue to remain unchanged. Believe me, I have heard my fair share of Queen covers, some great (Asterisk), some good (Morning) and some awful (Guns N' Roses), but never in my life have I heard such an aural atrocity as 'Killer Queen: A Tribute to Queen'. With the exception of the Flaming Lips lovely interpretation of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' there is nothing, I mean NOTHING, of any worth on this compilation. This collection of fantastic songs is obliterated due to the complete and utter lack of talent that Hollywood Records decided would look good on a tribute album. You can't replace Freddie Mercury, and I'm sure he is rolling over in his grave with so many horrid bands destroying the songs that he perfected. So congradulations Jason Mraz, Shinedown, Joss Stone, etc., you have not only discredited a classic band, you have also released what may be the worst album of the new millenium 
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 I miss the shows like "Roco's Modern Life," "Angry Beavers," and "invader Zim" (Which is all right because that show is already on DVD). I want these shows to be on a disk 
 As a professional my self I do not advice to buy this book, the reason is simple: People who are involved in mixed paellas (meats & seafood) do not understand the true soul of this dish. Ask anyone in Valencia what he thinks about mixing shrimp with meats, Its a herecy! I recomend you buy the book "100 Paellas & 1 Fidehuá, this is the closest you will be to the real thing but is in Spanish only. THE MIXED PAELLA WAS CREATED DURING THE TURIST BOOM OF THE MID XX CENTURY IN SPAIN AND IS A PRODUCT FOR IGNORANT TURISTS, no Paella made by a Valencian or any old school coock will have both seafood and meats.

 My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either. 
 First, to debunk the product description, the most terrifying "Jaws" ever will always be the first. Nothing after that is even in the same league. And this chapter continues the devolution that started after the ending credits of the original, topped only by "Jaws 4- The Revenge," in being worse. "III was originally released at the theater  in 3-D, which didn't improve it by any stretch, rather made it more of a novelty. In viewing in non-3D release, it's even worse because you can see how the director catered to the 3-D scenes, which are obvious when you watch it now. The acting couldn't be more "made for TV," as can be said about the whole storyline, the scenes and the deception freely utilized by the camera and director. This is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself scoffing, "Yeah, right!", when seeing many of the sequences. Even the very ending of the movie caused us to laugh with contempt when exiting the theater. Once again, another movie, regardless of how bad it is, I peak at it occasionally when on the Dish just to watch Lea Thompson, even though her acting in this one is nothing for the time capsules. The same can be said of the whole cast in fact, including, shamefully, Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar winning "Officer and a Gentleman" role. He couldn't have a more annoying, over the top, archetypical character. I hope the check was worth it Louis. There's nothing nearly as suspenseful, dramatic, or engaging as the original. There are no characters that you really care about- there's no depth, merely posturing by the characters. And the climax' plausibility is an insult to one's intelligence. This movie is just plain bad. In that it can be worth a watch alone, just to take pot shots at the absurdity of it all and to see how far down making a buck had dragged down the once proud brand name of "Jaws. 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 I'm not Catholic, but I was interested in learning about any evidence disproves the theories set forth in The DaVinci Code,so that I would understand their opposition to the book.   I thought this book would give me an objective view of the historic facts that The Davinci Code was based on, instead, it denied the theories using mostly beliefs as their supporting evidence.    I was disappointed because I had a hard time learning, from an academic perspective, why the Catholic church might have been falsely represented in this book 
 I purchased four of these shot glasses. Of the four, one has tiny bubbles throughout, one has black specs in the glass, one has a bulge in the glass, and the last is taller than the other three.  The shape is beautiful, but with all the imperfections, I'd recommend something else.  My most disappointing Bodum purchase ever 
 There is a place for campy, cartoon-character pop, and Jessica clearly knows this. Hell, she's managed to build a career out of it! A Public Affair is her cheesiest record yet, a salute to roller rinks and preteen bonfires that relishes in its own stupidity. When it works, it's poppy fun, but these moments are unfortunately few and far between.  The best parts of A Public Affair imitate (or sample) superior artists. The title track owes its entire existence to a bouncy Madonna sample, and once the chorus of overexcited roller skaters chimes in at the end, resistance is futile. The other highlights are Simpson's cover of Dead Or Alive's You Spin Me Round (Like A Record), B.O.Y. (with guitar stabs that sound suspiciously like they belong in the Cars' Just What I Needed) and the sugary Shania Twain sound-alike Walkin' `Round In A Circle. The rest of the album is less successful.  Simpson dons her daisy dukes once more for Push Your Tush, an embarrassing (self mocking?) country/pop/dance mixture that falls flat on its face with painfully unfunny proclamations like "take it to the barnyard!" Towards the end, A Public Affair becomes almost unlistenable. Unlike the breezy first half, Simpson decides to return to her standard oversing-every-note-that-I-can delivery. Given her earnestness, especially on the break-up ballad Let Him Fly, it could be campy fun. Sadly, the melodies just aren't there.  Key Tracks: Walkin' `Round In A Circle, A Public Affair, You Spin Me Round (Like A Record 
 10 or 20 pages of nice graphs worth copying and keeping on your desk, otherwise really generic, should be kept for reading in the subwa 
 Usually, I'll give a book about 50 pages to get interesting before putting it down. This is one book that failed the test. It would seem that any author who set about offering an alternate theory of IQ would not be able to fail to create an interesting discussion, but this author did just that.  We did not need to know about all the structures of the brain that make it such that intellect is such a separate thing from emotion. With the functions of only 10% of the brain known, the author is setting himself up for someone to prove him wrong. It would have been better if he had assumed that IQ and EQ exist and are distinct in terms of what they correspond to in real world results.  Don't invest any money in this 
 Had to read this book for a class and I thought it was horrible. After reading only a few chapters you basically have the gist of the whole book because it really doesn't go anywhere. It's just a repetition of car crashes and lude sexual acts which the author seems to be using as a way in which to carry his reader's attention. It feels entirely forced and is noticable that the author throws in random sexual acts and fantasies at the end of nearly every chapter as a way to keep his audience engaged. It seems like it could have been a decent short story but that it was drawn out into a novel without any clear direction of where the story is going. I feel slightly disgusted that this was actually published 
 when this album makes ixnay and americana look like works of genious, you know the offspring appear doomed. i mean i may only say there is one keeper on this album. the song "want you bad," as sugar coated as it is, is really a great song...that may warrant the single star. ixnay and americana werent that great, but this one, as with the follow-up bite the bullet...they are turning into a pop band....dont even try to compare this to anything smash and previous. gone are the days of social criticism and observations...heck, even the experimental days that were present in ixnay and americana are less than half baked on here!  if you want my advice, i would say get smash first, then get ignition, and then get the epitaph records version of the self-titled....if you love those, okay go and buy ixnay..and still, if you cannot get enough of that, get americana, but STOP THERE!!! ...i just hope they make a comeback to at least an ixnay-ish sound with a new album..because this lands just a notch below warped tour fodder/mtv fodder radar 
 The new version of this book is now being sold under a different title: "The Corporate Records Handbook". Don't buy this old version 
 Too long. Too much smoking and drinking. Too much bizarre sex.  A disappointment, because it could have been much better 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 If this is your thing : "I can't  say for certain,but I believe 42 different songs in three consecutive shows is a record for Dylan up until 1987. The closest contender seems to be 29 different songs in three consecutive shows at the volatile spring 1976 Rolling Thunder shows( and 39 different songs in five consecutive shows that spring)." then go for it .There are many many worse examples. However if you want a good book about music , try "Tricksta" by Nik Cohn 
 This book is a collection of American Rhymes and Jingles from all the ages.  It was written 1966, but many of the ryhmes in it are still around today.  Some examples are How Much Wood Could a Woodchuck Chuck, Mary had a Little Lamb, This Little Pig, and Star Light Star Bright.  This book is very well illustrated, compared to other books of this time period

 Diana needs information. So she poses as a landscape architect to gain access to the main house and all the secrets it holds.   If this sounds vague, that's because that is about all the reader knows for the first 150 pages. There is no question or hint at what Diana wants from the people of this small town. Eventually, the reader learns that Diana's brother Brad has not been seen or heard from in months, since he was at that house. The family already suspects that Brad is dead, but Diana needs answers to what really happened to her brother and if he is dead, where is his body?  Mixed with this is the paranormal angle of a ghost story that only adds more of an unrealistic view to the story and demonstrates how the author is unable to derive suspenseful twists to the plot without going outside the realm of reality. It is not that I don't enjoy a good paranormal novel, but the ghost story was secondary and pointless.  Is it worth buying? No. It was difficult to get into and although it had a little bit of a surprise to the reveal, the characters were underdeveloped, uninteresting and the ending was out of context with the rest of the story line. Not worth the money 
 I cannot believe this book had such a high number of positive reviews. I have read some bad books in my life but this one is one of the absolute worst!I am amazed that all the references to CHILD murder and rape can be overlooked by the rest of the reviewers 
  This movie is the BIG LIE logic attempting to prove itself again.  Most despotic criminals use a BIG LIE concept to manipulate those in society with the weakest minds a lame too often used mold from which Stan "Tookie" Williams is cut.  This DVD is nothing more than a BIG LIE! that ranks right up there with NAZI BIG LIE era Triumph Of The Will.  Like any monster Tookie spent his life hating the nasty reprobate aspects that defined his hearts core while hurting others to cover up the fact he lacked strength to confront and overcome demons who likely at birth began consuming his black heart.  This DVD should be brought so you can look directly into the face of a demon and see how BIG LIES told on a grand scale can most effectively prevert truth beyond recognition infecting minds hearts and souls.  Even if Stan Tookie" Williams is just responsible for "Helping Create" the Crips gang that in itself is enough to earn him the one way trip on the needle express in my book.  That he writes a few lame anti-gang kiddie books and played his con-game to perfection on 60 Minutes, "convicing soft headed bleeding heart liberals that he is, redeemed" is of no consequence whatsoever.  Tookie was a heartless murderer of whole neighborhoods.  Tookie by helping create his gang murdered the dreams of countless thousands of innocent children made victims of drive by shootings.  Tookie helped to utterly destroy thousands of urban inner city poor families usually those most ill prepared for the assult he used to lay waste what little they had.  Tookie raped minds and whole communities holding each hostage at gun point to his perverted twisted desires and whims and a few good deeds no matter how heartfelt do not de-fang this monster of the first order.  Tookie Williams was nothing more than a domestic terrorist superimposed on a gangsta thug dope dealer's reality.  In the end Tookie Williams got what he deserved a needle ride to Hell's Gate if there is any enternal justice.  Buy this Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story DVD if you want to see the modern day media formula for exploiting weak minds at work.  I look at Stan Tookie William's and all I see is just another a weak minded pathetic monster who underwent his "caged creep conversion" but in truth the gang of thugs he spawned go on their merry murderous way.  When I saw this DVD on Stan "Tookie" Williams he reminded me of Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts who like the crips were just gangs of common thugs who murdered as much for fun as profit.)  This is a good DVD because Jamie Foxx captured the heart and soul of what it means to be an unrepentant psychopathic, self absorbed social parasite in Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story.  If Tookie gets a Nobel Prize I think he should be forced to share it with Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts) as they were in essentially the same business of neighborhood destruction, child killing, weak mind exploitation and death for fun or profit 
 Despite the author's statement, there is nothing revolutionary about this book. In fact, many suggestions in it are falling by the wayside (paper training, "corrective jerk") as we learn more positive, fun ways to work with our dogs. Although it contains great suggestions for selecting a dog, other books have better all-around advice; for example, "A Simple Guide to Puppies." For true enlightenment on dog communication, read Patricia McConnell's delightful "The Other End of the Leash." Leave this one, with its aggressive approach to training, on the shelf 
 Praise the author all you want, but I have to take a different view. Eveybody has 15 minutes of fame, and I guess this is mine.  Somewhere in the first 30 pages (I believe; it's been a long time since I read it.) there's the recounting of an experience by a Univ of Mich student and his gay roommate. And how he moved out after I (Yes, that's right. I'm the gay roommate.) had put up a beefcake poster. No mention in the book of the Budweiser Boob poster I had to look at. Nobody interviewed me for the book to get my side of the story. A bit of a one-sided argument by the author if you ask me.  It's been over 20 years, but if I remember correctly, my roommate was Jewish. Would I be allowed to break my housing contract because of my roommate's faith? or because of his sexual orientation (STRAIGHT)? No. So, I think the administration was right in chastising him for stating my sexual orientation as grounds for contract release.  Life isn't all wine and roses. Some have an easier time of it than others based solely on having the right(?) skin color, gender, race, sexual orientation, etc. Until the laws and society ensure that ALL are treated equally, then those in the minority will have to continue to push a little harder to get their point across. If this causes the majority to re-evaluate their standards and expectations of what's right, then so be it.  "Reverse discrimination" isn't discrimination when those who benefit from it are afforded the same rights and priviledges that the majority takes for granted.  
 Dee Brown's The American West is the poor consolidation of three distinct books. The resulting consolidation reflects differing types of organization and style.   It is a series of disjointed, non sequential often unrelated vignettes that ramble across the Western American landscape. Focusing primarily on the West that occurred after the Civil War, it addresses a period of continual evolution, of transition between Native Peoples and their non native counterparts, between law and lawlessness and from one ecological state, wilderness, to farming, ranching and settlement.  But for all its lack of organization, continuity and sometimes poor writing quality, it is a book that manages to entertain and inform. Be prepared for some serious Native American bias. It appears the Mr. Brown feels the West should have never been developed to become the amazing part of America that it has become, but rather should have been left to Stone Age peoples in perpetuity.   It is a very quick read with lots of simple sentences and even simpler logic that in a very direct way can evoke a reasonable amount of sympathy for the author's agenda. This bias can and does effectively cloud what really happened.  
 The biggest draw for me in anime is an engaging plotline that really makes you think in new directions.  Witch Hunter Robin was recommended to me by a fellow lover of the more serious type of anime.  I didn't like it; I found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a 'so-that's-it?' ending I hated.  The animation is top quality with lots of dark tones and the music is appropriately spooky.  Good visuals don't make up for bad story though.  This serious drama geared is towards adults, and not children.  If you like dramatic build-up that delivers, humor, or romantic comedy give this a pass 
 I was really excited to get this book after reading all the good reviews.  However, it seems as though it was put together haphazardly - not a lot of thought put into it.  Seems like Jackie took the recipes she uses for her home delivery meals and slapped them into a meal plan and a shopping list, without giving any thought to practicality and convenience.   She creates a full menu for each day, which is nice, but they are not well organized and create a lot of wasted food.  For example, she has you make a lunch every day that serves 4.   Which is fine, except you have no way to use the leftovers because she says you must use the entire days' menu, not switch out individual meals.  So your extra 3 servings of that lunch go to waste??  She does say you can swap an entire day out, but who wants to eat the same exact thing day in and day out so you can maximize your grocery shopping and not create waste (not something I usually worry too much about, but if I put the effort into making a meal, I would like to be able to eat it).    The meals do look good, but I think she needs to put some effort into making it doable for a new mom.  Maybe allow you pick and choose the meals and snacks you like each day.  The grocery lists are also too extensive - buying two different kinds of peanut butter and using a minimal amount, etc 
 This hardcore conservative did not enjoy this book.  The book is filled with a wealth of eye-opening information on significant people that I did not know but should (like Hugo Chavez's new best friend, Noam Chomsky), but the reading is so laborious and draining that I cannot recommend it.  It has none of the light-hearted fun that we often get from Rush Limbaugh.  Rather, it brought to mind the dark experience of listening alone to Michael Savage in a bad mood after dark.  The cheeky title is misleading - this was a joyless book to read 
 'Dance of the Dead' is director Tobe Hooper's (Poltergeist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) contribution to the uneven first season of 'Masters of Horror'. The series contains 13 mini-horror films helmed by famous horror directors.   Some entries have fared better than others. This particular episode is, unfortunately, one of those others.   The setting is a post-apocalyptic society where a plague has wiped out most of humanity. There are two kinds of folks left; decent, and 80's-movie, leather-clad baddies.  Sound familiar? That's because it's adapted from a short story by Richard Matheson who penned 'I am Legend', another 'Omega Man' style yarn that draws a line between good and not as good.   It isn't, however, the story that I take issue with. It's a decent 60-minute distraction, and the premise, from which the title stems, gleefully earns its horror stripes. The acting isn't all bad. One can always count on Robert Englund (all dolled up as the wicked drag queen MC of this freakshow) to bring something original to the table. Rather, the issue at hand is the stylistic choices, or lack thereof, employed by our featured director.   Tobe Hooper has directed everything from horror masterpieces (The aforementioned 'Poltergeist' and 'TCM'), to interesting misfires ('Spontaneous Combustion' and 'TCM 2'), to absolute stinkers ('The Mangler', 'The Funhouse'), but they've always had that distinct, old-school Hooper stamp. This, I am sorry to say, does not.   If I am to ingest an episode from a series with the moniker 'Masters of Horror', wherein a featured director brings his own sensibility to the table, then that is exactly what I expect to see. What we have here is a director who, afraid of taking a misstep, ends up delivering something entirely not his own. 'Dance of the Dead' is a slap dash jumble of a film that heavily employs bargain basement level 'MTV-Style editing', which only as tired and outdated as the term 'MTV-Style editing'.  Don't get me wrong, for fans of the series, it is not to be missed. For those that desire to know every aspect of the production (from the adaptation of the story to Englund's inspirations for his character) this episode is for you. However, if you're in the market for top-shelf Masters of Horror, you'll find better company in Don Coscarelli, John Carpenter or Stuart Gordon.   This one is better left for dead. 
 I thought this would be more of a how-to for prospective writers, but it ends up being more of a treatise of sex as a whole, not how to write about it and make it interesting. You're better off reading Dr. Ruth, who is at least entertaining. This was dry, dull and borin 
 Classic brick AC/DC transformer is for North America only. I hoped for a "dual voltage" AC/DC convertor which could be used overseas 
 Technical Readout 3055 was written during the "dark years" of  FASA's BattleTech line, when writing, layout, and illustrations were at an  all-time low.  Even by the standards of the time, the illustrations in this  book are some of the worst that have ever appeared anywhere in FASA's  products.  The 'Mech designs are all poorly conceived and drawn, with many,  such as the Naginata, looking like they are made of cardboard boxes.  As  for the stats of the 'Mechs, they are mostly "munchkin" designs,  with multiple pulse lasers and streak SRM launchers, etc 
 Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish  until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly 
 For someone who is reading the whole series at one time, this book might be great. But when I read this book, it had been over two years since I'd read the one before it, and I could not even finish it. I tried to stick with it, but I eventually put it down and could not pick it up again. Is this not the conclusion to the MITFORD series? So why can't a poor reader read about MITFORD instead about a bunch of characters we know nothing about, who we won't get to know very well seeing as this is the last book. I am a big fan of the whole series, but this book was simply painful. 
 The book is too disjointed and much of it reads like poetry this isn't what I expected 
 This was a book that i was required to read for my english lit class.  Although i didn't personally like the book, many people that i know did.  I found the subject matter very boring, partly because of my inability to relate to it.  I would only recommend this book to someone with a strong interest in South African politics 
 You loved Ender's Game, right?  And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean.  Terrific.  Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.  It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books.  The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).  This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.  It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It hardly makes any sense at all.  Beware 
 I do not usually leave comments about purchases but this Johnson/Broida offering is so dismal it deserves a mention.  You will be much better off with Palm's online documentation/help files and forget about wasting your money on this turkey.  Truly a real disappointment.  No fault for Amazon....delivery was, as usual, very fas 
 I am a beginner to real estate trying to understand pros and cons of real estate investment. I wanted a book which would explain me step by step on how I can start in a small way and grow big. This books starts big and talks about $2 million dollar investments. I do not want to take such a big step to begin my real estate investments. I would recommend reading 'How to Succeed and Make Money with your first rental house' for beginners in this business.  This book is not worth reading even once 
 Iles tries to imitate Michael Crichton with bits of Dan Brown's Digital Fortress in this book.  Unfortunately this book does not make it.  The NSA is backing a project called Trinity which is to develop a super quantum computer that is controlled by a brainscan of a human mind.  Two of the individuals involved with the project want it halted and one dies in an apparent stroke which was actually induced by the NSA bad guys (why does the NSA always have to be portrayed as the bad guys in these books?).  David Tennant is the other individual and he gets away by stopping an unstoppable hitman and then persuades his psychiatrist to run with him, even though she thinks he is mentally unstable.  The plot really gets out of hand with Tennant having visions of being Jesus, being portrayed to the Secret Service as the next Oswald and escaping the entire Washington DC police and SWAT units and ultimately getting out the country with a false passport, going to Israel and then persuading the head of the Moussad to help him.  As crazy as it sounds the end is literally unbelievable that would even make a James Bond fan cringe.  The author has written some great tense books (24 Hours, Sleep No More) so I just chalk this one up to an experiment gone awry. 
 This book starts out with the affectation of being somehow applicable to "modern man." The author assumes modern men are "broken" and therefore must somehow be "fixed," and he offers his advice on how to go about being "A Real Man." Therefore this book will appeal chiefly to boys and men who feel inadequate as males and men; the same men who buy Hummers and/or guns and/or beat women and abuse children to compensate for their wan manhood (real or perceived).  The author portrays modern man as the victim to changing male roles. While this is true for some boys and men, it is by no means a universal trait. Any man who follows the dictates of his conscience and sense of honor and valor will know intrinsically what his role in life is; he will also find this book insulting and absurd.  Mentoring a boy and young man is a good thing; however, a young man must know when to slay his father and become a man himself. The danger of mentoring is that of the "alpha male" mentality taking over and running a boy's or young man's life to his detriment: when that occurs, cultist mentality takes over. (A good, and frightening, example of this is Robert Bly himself.) Taken too far, this mentality leads to horrors such as the People's Temple (Jim Jones and his mass murder-suicide), Heaven's Gate, Scientology, and a numberless other dangerous Follow-The-Leader mind-sets.  For those boys and men who feel they need such advice, a far superior book is "Fire in the Belly" by Sam Keen. It does not have the foreboding sense of victimization that "Iron John" does and it is far better thought-out as well as written 
 I found this book to be more high tech than possible for the average reader to understand.  It was not helpful at all 
 Purchased for a Summer Reading requirement for my son for school he said "it was verry boring" 
 This reviewer is new to the world of collecting military firearms and wanted to educate himself--especially regarding german mausers. Admittedly, this reviewer did not know the difference between a "byf" or a "dou" marking, or even where they might appear on the rifle. Unfortunately, this book is geared more towards experienced collectors, especially those who collect other than german mausers, and not novices. A picture (of which there are none) showing such basics as where the markings are located would have spoke a thousand words 
 I got this telescope for my desk at work because I have a decent view.  It stinks, I think I can see better with my naked eye.  Plus you can not focus it because the slider is so stiff.  I guess I will be buying another telescope now 
 Although Katzenbach has become one of my favorite authors, you can tell that The Traveler is only his second book.While the story is interesting, his dialogue is weak and he doesn't move the story along at a fast enough  pace. He's come a long way since The Traveler. If you like really good  thrillers, try these books by Katzenbach--Hart's War (his latest), The  Shadow Man and Just Cause 
 Although the basics of statics is explained in each chapter, this doesn't help answer the more complicated section and review questions in each chapter. The examples were too simple and very few were given. I found myself refering back to my calculus textbook to get a more in depth explaination of the topics. And even though every other question had an answer in the back of the book (which is typical of most textbooks), that didn't help with the actual step by step solution of the question. You're left on your own to dig through the book to piece together a solution for each problem. A student solutions manual would be helpful. I would not recommend this book if you plan on using it in a self taught enviroment 
 Like wizards game game, but not as good.  Decided to leave at resort 
 	Linda Lawrence Hunt must have had a time machine.  She chronicles Helga and Clara Estby's 1896 walk from Washington State to New York City in her 336 page book Bold Spirit.  She did so, even though all were unavailable to her.  Helga Estby, a Norwegian immigrant, keep many detailed journals during and after her journey, but her family burned them out of spite and shame.  Helga Estby walked across America to receive $10,000.  She planned to use it to pay off the debts she and her husband Ole and their ten children had accumulated.  Or so says Linda Lawrence Hunt.   	Bold Spirit is ten percent fact and ninety percent speculation.  Gleaning from only a few newspaper articles, public records, and a few interviews, Hunt manages to produce a considerably long piece of what she calls non-fiction.  For all we know, Estby planned to use the money to open up an opium den.  Just because the Estby's were struggling financially and Helga was offered $10,000 doesn't mean she planned to use the money to pay off debts.  Sometimes people do things that don't make sense.   	Hunt's "primary sources" are questionable.  Biased and inaccurate press is as much of an American tradition as hot dogs and beer, and it was especially rampant in Victorian America, as literacy rates and newspaper production rates were increasing but rules about unbiased media hadn't been established.  While periodicals help supplement a biographical account, they should not be the foundation of it.  Because time makes memories fade, interviews of family and friends are just as inaccurate. 	Hunt assumes the political views of Estby and her daughter.  She assumes that Helga was a feminist.  Had Helga been as strong of a woman as Hunt portrays, perhaps she would have written a book about her walk, like she had planned.  Perhaps she wouldn't have taken her nineteen-year-old daughter with her on the 3,500-mile walk.  Perhaps she would have opened up a school or started speaking to the community about her walk.  Estby becomes incredibly apathetic after the walk; perhaps she was depressed because of the death of two of her children while she was away.  Perhaps because she and Ole were never able to fix their relationship after she was away for so long.  Perhaps it was because she was raped or hurt on the trip.  No one knows, not even Linda Lawrence Hunt.  This kind of speculative "non-fiction" should not become a precedent in the historical world. 	This book would have been enjoyable if it were historical fiction.  Hunt could have used her imagination as much as she wanted to do pretty much what she did in Bold Spirit: fill in the gaps left by the documents.  She could have spruced up the story and added plot twists.  Her writing style is insultingly simplistic. 	I would recommend this book to a fifth grader.  The writing style is easy enough to understand.  The plot is basic.  On the surface, it is an encouraging tale about a bold, courageous woman.  But anyone interested in historical integrity, an interesting story, or reading anything past a fourth grade reading level should probably stay far far away from Bold Spirit 
 I'm an Afx user and found this book painfully basic. I bought it because it was recomended for high-end users which I'm sorry to say is a lie. The 'keying tutorials' arent even tutorials; they're just examples of what you can do with 3'rd party Plugins. If I wanted a demonstration in how to download plugins I'd visit my local Crack site, thank you very much 
 This album is a total MESS...unfortunately, it can be too much of a shock when an artist evolves into something completely incomprehensible, and I most certainly DID NOT get this album at all. Needless to say I promptly got a refund... 
 At his best, MacLean is near the top of the pulp action genre with interesting locations and characters and a bit of romance.  "Fear", a story of revenge, misses the mark.  I never could quite connect with the protaganist and surprisingly, the ending was neither compelling or, to me, satisfying.  Other MacLean books such as "Dusty Death" and "Caravan" better display his true abilities 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 Mailer's second novel is that rare thing, a dull book. Overwhelmed with the success of Naked and the Dead, Mailer sought to write a Kafkaesque political thriller set against the pulsing paranoia of the fifties, and finds himself tripped up by haphazard plotting, grating dialogue, and wooden characters.The dialogue, it needs to be said, is the stiffest assortment of cold war banter one could imagine from a political novel set in the 1950s; there is a particular failure to connect the various political disillusionments that abound through these pages with the chronically self-loathing slouching that goes on as the men and women schlep room to room in the story's shabby rooming house. Had this been an absurdist comedy, one might have gotten an appreciative chuckle if not a belly laugh by what Mailer was doing ,but this is played straight, serious as tax audit, and there is little air in the private hells each chapter outlines. The novel is remarkable if only because it wound up not being the career killer for Mailer that this sort of graceless and pretentious effort would mean for a less resilient talent. But Resilient Mailer is, as his steely production following this lethargic parable evinces.   It's interesting to note that he refers to his subsequent collection and memoir "Advertisements for Myself" as a "biography of a style", detailing his struggle to absorb and transcend his influences with a voice that was his alone , a style that would be his instrument his brilliant efforts to provoke and inspire and anger his readers.   He has particularly moving and insightful things to say about the struggle he had in the writing and rewriting of "Barbary Shore", and in retrospect we witness in the book a great writer choking on his ambition as he wrestles with a set of ideas he cannot yet put into a beautifully writ set of paragraphs. Mailer would soon develop one of the best prose styles of his time, but suffice to say that he hadn't yet come up with a set of nuances uniquely his own when this book emerged 
 In my opinion this book jumps around way too much and is a little confusing.  It has dialogue for a couple of people, then another couple of people, and then another.  I suggest you take notes to keep up with who everyone is and what is going on 
 This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself. 
 The main thing I learnt from this book is that it is definitely better sometimes to look through a book before buying it. I thought this was a very juvenile book, in terms of the level of smearing and name calling I thought there was, e.g. the False Memory Syndrome Foundation is described as "the CIA's answer to the flat earth society"and Col John Alexander is given the epithet "Doctor of Death". Some child abuse cases are recounted with an unnecessary level of graphic detail, and the author includes a partially obscured picture of a scene of child pornography. I wondered if this was really needed, but then I remembered that the publisher is Feral House, which also publishes books by Satanist Anton LaVey and the Apocalypse Culture books, which also feature child porn. Instead of blaming the CIA for everything, Mr Constantine could also have pointed the finger at his publisher for potentially encouraging Satanism and child abuse.   I don't really want to spend more time saying what I didn't like about this book, but I didn't like the way the author seemed to be so sure of himself. Some examples: all UFOs are manmade, all "alien" abductions are CIA abductions, remote viewing is the CIA beaming images into people's heads. 
 Make sure that you want to buy this type of book.  It was not at all what I was expecting 
 I bought this book because I was rebuilding my T 176 Transmission. The preview stated that it gave information on transmission rebuilds. Well it does, but not on the one I have. Does not give info on the T176/T178 tranny. After I bought the book I realized this is one mans rebuild of a Jeep as it should be in his mind. Stick with the Chiltons. Overall I did not find this book useful. 
 Not worth your money or time.  The sender was excellent but the quality of the DVD (regarding the content) was very racial.  Very insulting! 
 While some readers may feel inclined to write a positive review of this book merely because of a sympathy felt for the author and/or narrator, or a shared sense of moralistic triumph, the book truly lacks any kind of literary craft or merit. While the narrator's ability to always be the victim, her punishment of the book's rather flat characters and a lack of providing any kind of tactful or subtle plot movement or meaningful emotional exposition--really, anything insightful--makes it difficult to even complete the book.  Plenty of people have been addicted to drugs and have gone what Heather has gone through. I just hope that those who are able to clean up have enough sobriety to tell whether or not they can write a decent book about it. 
 I usually love Patricia Cornwell's stuff but now it seems that she is getting so far away from her main character base that it all seems strange.  I am a funny reader and when I like something I like it to seem semi familiar.  This book felt odd and I didn't finish it. sorry 
 Please note -- this movie receives one star ONLY because Amazon does not offer a zero star (or, more appropriately for this film, negative) rating.    Recently, Entertainment Weekly compiled a list of the "25 Worst Movie Sequels" ever.  How "An American Werewolf in Paris" avoided its rightful place on this list is now one of the great mysteries of my life.   Like everyone else drawn to this unfortunate attempt at a film, I watched because I am a fan of John Landis' original "American Werewolf."  Watched, that is, 15 minutes...which was more than enough time to establish that this 'sequel' should have been stillborn during pre-production.  I was almost tempted to follow this 'film' to its conclusion, to see exactly how bad it could get, but I simply could not subject myself to such torture.  The only thing that could make this a worse movie?  Viewing the original "Werewolf" first, which will emphasize even more the tragedy that was "American Werewolf in Paris."  So, why was this such a terrible movie?  I should have taken the DVD case description as a sign -- it explained that I would be watching a (I'm paraphrasing...but pretty close) 'rockin' horror film with a 'hip, up and coming group of young actors,' and, even better, I would be treated to 'a soundtrack complete with the hottest of today's music.'   Umm...no.  I challenge you to find more blatant lies than the ones offered by the movie's promoters.    To wit, a sample of several idiotic scenes and plot devices: (1) Tom Everett Scott wants to prove his courage by bungy jumping off the Eiffel Tower...which would be fine, except, given the shape of that particular structure (going out from top to bottom), our young hero would be jumping into the tower itself.  That might be a problem, but one he never seems to consider.  Can we really like a protagonist this stupid?   (2) Just before he is ready to leap, a young woman throws herself off the ledge.  T.E. Scott jumps to save her (despite the fact that his rope is not yet harnassed), and gracefully nabs her just before she becomes another splatter on the sidewalk.  She runs off, he (hey, I was right!) bangs his head on a beam and is put in hospital.  After waking, his concern for her is understandable...but why, in any rational universe, would he suddenly be infatuated with a clearly suicidal woman?  He says something to the effect that she is 'different' or 'sophisticated' or some other garbage...despite the fact that their relationship at that point comprises all of eight (wordless) seconds.  (Here, I'm also a bit nitpicky...because I can't for the life of me fathom why he would Julie Delpy even remotely attractive; mental instability is bad enough, but her looks hardly negate those problems).  Anyway, for absolutely no lucid reason, he suddenly decides that this is the girl of his dreams...the entire movie is based on his inexplicable admiration, a flaw symptomatic of the entire plot structure.   (3) The classic scene: the young lovers' first date...in which he 'accidentally' pulls out a handful of condoms, and to subdue her anxiety about his intentions, he is forced to pretend they are actually pieces of gum.  Yes, this is the level of sophistication clearly rampant throughout the movie.    Those are the high points of the first ten minutes, and I'm fairly certain the rest of narrative is downhill from that atrocious beginning.  
 I was expecting a really great story when I bought this book.  I've been watching the TV show Lost since it first aired, and I thought that reading this book would be a fun way to find some tidbits and clues about the backstory of the television program.  While the story was mildly interesting, the pages were filled with cliches and poor delivery.  I would have bene much happier with the book if I had known that prior to buying it.  I still would have purchased the book because of its connection to the television show, but I wouldn't have been expecting a well told mystery to come with the package 
 I thought "Silver Pigs" was wonderful. By this one, Falco is tiresome, trite and boring. The humourous cynicism present in the earlier novels seems to be both studied and begrudging in the later ones. And the family is NOT that cute. Still, there are a few flashes of humour. If Falco would ditch the extended family, Davis would tighten up the writing and not be quite so coy, this series could be salvaged. Davis should take a few lessons from John Maddox Roberts and Decius 
 A good book as far as it goes, but it doesn't go far into truth. Although Johnson recalls his early years,the lessons he learned about hard work,etc. this book reads like a fluff job.  It would have been a lot better if he told the full truth.  Anyone who has some experience with life knows that there is another side to the story.  Intrestingly, this side is seldom heard.  Pro athletes and other celebrities are usually portrayed in a glowing light that hide dark truths.  Johnson claims that in the cities he played in there were usually many beautiful women who waited for the athletes.  In the book it is implied that this is one of the perks of being a pro. Really? You hear of other athletes who take advantage of this and are slapped with paternity suits, the women are given hush money, the athletes pay for their education and then are dropped by the groupies,or the groupies are set up for life by the athletes.  With all the thousands of women Johnson supposedly slept with you hear nothing about this, and outside of AIDS he didn't get any other sexually transmitted disease sleeping with all these women?  I find that incredible, since anyone else would be seeing the doctor pretty often.  Most of the groupies are beautiful because its easier to trap the athletes money with. Does anyone really believe that athletes will sleep with ugly women?  These groupies aren't stupid. The hard truth is that people are selfish.  They don't sleep with athletes or other celebrities because of their status, but what it will get for them ie, bragging rights, paternity suits, etc. Most athletes are notoriously tight-lipped about this.  But sometimes the truth comes out.  One nameless athlete said "If the public knew what's going on with groupies, the payoffs etc. sports would lose a lot of money."  Its all about the money.  This is why opposing evidence is suppressed and why you seldom hear about the dark side.  Does anyone seriously believe that vested intrests who profit from the athletes image, who make money selling sports merchandise and everthing connected with it want the truth out? Yeah, right. This book is little more than propaganda.  If Johnson were serious about helping people out, he would tell the full truth.  Save your money. 
 Similar to most of the reviews of the book the strong points include helping a person form effective communication with others. It has a nice foundation for people who are new to public speaking, and a reminder for those who have been doing it for a while.   However, the book is just plain dated. There must be a new book from another author that we could steer people towards. The business and professional world has changed in the 11 years since the book was released. The pace of conversation, the use of technology to communicate, etc.   I must agree with another reviewer who noted that the book did little to address Executive status or sounding like a Leader, as the title infers.   Sorry, I know it takes a lot to create a book for others to read, but this particular one just does not deliver.   
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 There are cinematic masterpieces, and there are films that really make you feel the producer knows how to use film to its fullest.  This stinker convinced me Mr. Lynch owned shares in Kodak and wanted to sell film by the mile.  The only reason you may want to see this is so you will convince yourself never to see a David Lynch work ever again.  Do not buy it!!  Manos, The Hands of Fate is much more watchable than this. I get Brian Eno and ambient/atmosphere music is so you will use it as a background along with your imagination to create your own inner experience.  Film doesn't work that way (another reviewer compared this with Eno).   I find Memento a brilliant piece of work, really making me forget I am watching a film.  I think Videodrome is wonderful and compelling.  This - make sure you can watch something else.  Watch this in 100x speed.  You won't miss a thing. Okay, I just remembered, there is one movie worse than this one.  Reflections Of Evil.  If you actually like Eraserhead then get that movie too.  Me, I'd rather put a brain-eating worm in my ear from whatever planet Kahn was exiled to in Star Trek II.  Much less painful than watching this 
 Positives about this book is that, unlike other books which offer "cure", nowhere does Null states or implies that the book is intended to cure or eliminate any sort of disease or illness, besides that aspect, the book is largely disappointing. Unfortunately much of the information contained here can be found on the Internet, but there are several problems as well.  In certain illness or diseases he can state up to 30-50 possible herbs/vitamins (which can be confusing at times). The problem is that for some of them he is reluctant to tell you the appropriate dosages to take. Secondly, there side effects, for example; take 200 B6 over the long run can cause nerve damage, which brings up the next point, which he is reluctant to tell the precautionary details of combining certain herbs and supplements, which can be toxic and deadly. You can't just tells the reader, take this take that, and not tell them what might happen. For example he recommends Echinacea, for cancer, and CTS, and other health problems, but in certain cases Echinacea has been known to cause, liver inflammation, kidney failure, or irregular heart rate. That just one example of many herbs that can be toxic....  This is book that pretty much, I or you can make just by going to the library, and the internet searching for diseases and illness, but somebody who is scholar, and has PhD, should not take the short cut to make easy $$$, and just throw information, without and facts research. IN THE END YOU CAN'T DISTINGUISH THIS BOOK FROM WHAT YOU READ ON THE INTERNET, SO THAN YOU HAVE TO ASK YOU'RE SELF THIS QUESTION? WHY BOTHER BUYING IT.  P.S this absolutely not the "whole encoylopedia" of natural healing, he leaves out a few hundred other major disease/ilness. 
 first: I haven't finished reading the book and am not sure I will second: Donald readily acknowledges that there are multiple meanings to the word consciousness, he then takes one meaning "the creative engine itself, [...] the center of human genius". He even acknowledges that "this book proposes a theory of consciousness that [...] does not try to 'explain' how awareness could have emerged from a material thing such as a brain". But then he starts to slash against anyone (like e.g. Dennett) who tries to develop such explanations. He is so consumed in fighting against the 'hardliners' that his own theory is invisible and often rests on his (ours) intuition that there must be "somebody home". He even compares the telling of such theories with telling someone that his parents are "Jack the Ripper and Elsa, She-Wolf of the SS" (p. 45). Strong picture but weak argument.  I think his further arguments about complex interactions like an evening long conversation about a film has its merits, showing that there is something more about culture and consciousness, memory and inter-subject communication, than what someone like Dennett (or Pinker) is trying to explain. But that is the point: they are trying to explain a different meaning of the word consciousness: "How does it work on a basic level, how could consciousness 'become' and not how it evolved from there. So Donald in his attacks is comparing apples to oranges and that makes his book a pain to read. 
 As a student of an Ivy League Institution, I thought that Wertheim's "man-bashing" was inappropriate and unfounded.  Her interpretation of historical facts were deceptive and misleading.  She  twisted these facts in conniving ways to support her feminist thesis 
 Coffee is a brown beautiful color.Ink is black set to a white back ground in books for a very good reason.If I had known the printing in this book was a light brown color that is hard to read I would not have wasted my time or money.This may be a very good book but I will never know.Keep the color in the coffee and your hands off the ink.I have the fifth edition 
 I found this book under the 'War and Peace' section of my local bookstore. I read it just out of curiosity... and WOW... Talk about a book that probably should NEVER EVER find it's way into a child's hands. I realize that it's intention is to talk about the cruelty and savagry of war, but I still think the subject matter is highly, HIGHLY uncalled for.  Basically, here's the story. During WW2 the officials of a Tokyo zoo decide that they need to kill all the zoo animals for fear the if they do not, the zoo will eventually be bombed and the animals will run wild. Clearly the only solution is to kill them (*scoff*). Anyway, so they officials go about poisoning all the animals, however every method they try does not work with the elephants. And so, naturally, they decide that the only way to kill these elephants is to starve them to death (forget a quick bullet to the head, no, only starving them will work.. AGH!)... So the book spends a good 5-6 pages following these poor elephants over a 2 week period as they slowly starve to death.  In the end, all the elephants lay dead in the cages, with limp trunks hanging between the bars. Nice. Fantastic bedtime story for children of all ages...  .... NOT!  Absolutely horrific!! Why not just take your children to the SPCA and make them watch animals be euthanized? There are things that children just do not need to have thrown in their faces, and this is one of them. Wait until they are in their teens are are able to really grasp the concept of war and death. This book is EXTREMELY emotionally disturbing and I can see it causing a great deal of harm to a senstive child.   Steer clear 
 Analyze That reunites the main cast from Analyze This and opens with Paul Vitti (De Niro) in prison and he wants out. What's he do to get out? Fakes insanity of course. How's he do that? By singing West Side Story songs. No, I'm not kidding. And the movie just gets worse from there. Vitti is placed into the caring hands of his old pal Dr. Sobel (Billy Crystal) and laughs are nowhere to be found.  I honestly think I only laughed once during the whole 96 minutes that actually felt more like 179 minutes. There's a small scene where Vitti is trying to take on normal jobs, but his mafia mindset causes a few chuckles. That's about all that's funny in this disaster. A good subtitle for the movie would be "Cashin' the Paycheck". That's all everyone seems to be doing in the flick. Everyone just seems so miserable, and with that cloud hanging over things laughter can't develop. A comedy without laugher is a total failure, and if it were for those extremely rare moments in this flick there it is possible to dig up something funny, Analyze That would be a failure.   In the end, it's a sequel to a simply average comedy that lacks any of the sparks or intelligence that kept the original from total despair. 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham

 If you want to read the purple prose of a man who is deeply ashamed of being latino and gay--in fact, so ashamed of the latter that he paints a picture of gays and lesbians as a talentless lot of artificial people doomed by moral pestilence-- then this is the book for you. If you're white and heterosexual and you're looking for a brown-skinned person to make you feel like you're culturally superior, why this book will be downright therapeutic 
 Let me just say that there are waaay better books out there on the subject, even if you just want to get a brief rundown. And you needn't even be a grammar nut like myself to feel antsy about when the next spelling or syntax error is going to show up, because there's an average of one per page. Honestly, I couldn't get through half the book, but I'm pretty sure there was nothing in the latter pages to make up for it. 
 The format of this book is pretty nice. The discussions are interesting, the recipes easy to follow, and the time estimates just slightly conservative. However, the seasoning is too tame and, ironically, the recipes don't seem to have been tested all that well.  The red lentils in coconut milk were underseasoned, even after doubling the garam masala and adding the optional cayenne pepper. The accompanying rice pillau was acceptable, but nothing special.  A tasty sounding recipe for polenta with roasted tomatoes and mozarella cheese was bland and the tomatoes, which were supposed to stay in the oven for 22 to 25 minutes, were burnt after only 15 min.  The chicken-under-brick *was* tasty and the skin came out crisp and flavorful, BUT it wasn't cooked all the way through. I tried this one twice, thinking that the first chicken was too large, and even cooked to a higher temperature the second time, but the chicken was still raw on the bottom. In retrospect, the bottom of the chicken only cooks in the oven for 10 minutes resting on raw potatoes. How could it possibly cook through?  Two stars for style and good ideas, but I probably won't be cooking directly from this book any more 
 This is such a condesending book about "Middle America."   The characters seem like the creation of a Harvard undergrad who thinks that mid west rubes are just so darn cute and earthy. Yuck 
 Avoid this book !!!  Prechters view is markets peaked in wave 5 in year 2000. Never called the bottom in 2002, and stated the high of year 2000 would not be surpassed. Well 6 years later the DOW has indeed surpassed the year 2000 high!  Listening to his advice would cost one dearly. Not only missing out on the recent market rise, but also constantly pushing one to take a bearish stance against the market during the entire rise over the past 3 plus years, while the market was rising!  
 It was easy to install but that is where the good points end.   To make this device work, I can not be farther away from the transmitter than 4 feet and even given this short distance, I have to point the remote to be extended at the receiving unit very precisely.  I should have cross hairs on my remote controllers ;-) Yes, I know, unbelievable.   Also the infrared transmitting power of the receiver is weak to say the best. It pretty much has to point directly at the device(s) that are the recipients of the remote control signal. It certainly doesn't "flood" the room with the infrared signal. As an electrical engineer I know how easily this could be accomplished.  Please stay away from this product. I am contemplating putting it into my recycle bin - it is absolutely useless....  
 I received my Ph.D. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from one of the best U.S. universities, and for more than thirty years was teaching and researching in the field of solid mechanics.  Before starting the reading of this book, I was in the agreeable mood with the author's that machines can never be human, and that AI will retain (if not forever) for a very long time its name - unreal.  But, now, I am dismayed.  The author unsuccessfully used 450 pages full of topics in mathematics and physics to support his point of view, making simple topics sound difficult, and making diffcult ones look impossibble.  The inclusion of his strange tilings is strange.  All in all, the book does not make sense. Moreover, his 'Note to the reader' (which is patronizing, arrogant and deceiving), and his Prologue and Epilogue (which are at best cynical) should have warned me not to venture any further.  I cannot help feeling sorry for myself and for several other readers; and most of all, if this is the author's usual way of communicating his ideas, for his students.  Luckily, I did not buy this book; for one person, who could not stand reading through it, dared me to finish his unfinished endeavor 
 The ones I received wouldn't lock anbd were bent. I need an address to return them and get a refund.  I don't have the receipt. 
 This is not the best version available of this fairytale...Stephen Carpenter's is much better.  In this version, the illustration and text don't even match.  The troll is described as having a nose as long as a poker and eyes as big as saucers...but the troll in the pictures has a bulbous nose and unremarkable eyes.  I don't know if it's an exact translation from Norwegian, but the grammar is occasionally ackward.  The metaphors in the speech given by the biggest Billy Goat to the troll have to be explained to a younger audience...which isn't bad in itself but contributes to the uneven flow in the text.  The pictures are good, too bad the writing isn't 
 Very disappointed... It didnt play any music its own & quiet difficult to squeeze..... 
 There are bad movies, and then there are BAD movies. "Universal Soldier: The Return" is a cosmically bad movie, a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to "Manos: The Hands of Fate" for comparison. The first "Universal Soldier" film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and "Rocky" refugee Dolph Lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do: people perished in violent ways, stuff exploded, and Van Damme and Lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film. Even the presence of the charming Ally Walker as Van Damme's female sidekick greatly helped the film. The movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition DVD some time back. It unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel. The second, and one hopes final, installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that I sat in open-mouthed awe watching it. I think I can safely say I am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity. Expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll.  Van Damme returns as Luc, the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film. On this outing he now works for Dr. Dylan Cotner (Xander Berkeley), a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer S.E.T.H. Luc, with his female sidekick Maggie (Kiana Tom), helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers. The film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse-pounding jaunt up a river, a jaunt filled with explosions, stunts, gunfire, and the briefest glimpse of Tom's incredibly fit form. As the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things: Kiana Tom is incredibly hot but can't act her way out of a paper bag, Luc has a daughter named Hillary (Karis Paige Bryant) who you just know will get into trouble at some point, and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are Romeo (Bill Goldberg) and the one played by Michael Jai White. Frankly, turning off the film immediately after glimpsing Tom's amazing physique is probably a good thing. Everything that follows is dull, predictable, and so full of plot holes as to defy description. "Universal Soldier: The Return" feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film.   Sure enough, Cotner's computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers. In the resulting conflagration S.E.T.H. implants its consciousness in Michael Jai White, Luc and his loved ones flee from the compound, and the military swoops in to contain the problem. An extraordinarily untalented actress named Heidi Schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called Erin who is interested in exposing the government's latest shenanigans. Predictably, Van Damme and Schanz team up to track down...er...well, track down something to defeat the supercomputer. I think they need some code to shut the system down, but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking Romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse Luc can hand out. Even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult's only club can't make this turkey fly. It's dull, folks, and painfully so. By the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between Luc and S.E.T.H. back at the shattered compound--with an injured Hillary's life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed Luc (Geez, what a surprise there!)--I knew I just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck. How bad can it be, you ask? Read on...  Plot holes in this film are innumerable, as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager's face. For example, Luc explains to Erin that he was once a universal soldier just like Romeo but Cotner "cured" him by restoring him to life; he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers. What the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when Cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications? He brought someone back from the dead! How exactly did he accomplish this feat? We don't find out from Van Damme, who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications. I could go on, but let's discuss the performances instead--or the lack thereof. I should say I adore Kiana Tom; she's a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth's rotation, but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth. Another problem is the lumbering Bill Goldberg, whose "funny" lines are anything but. And the more I think about Heidi Schanz, the less I think of her. You have to wonder about a film where Jean-Claude Van Damme is the best thespian in the cast.  You might think a movie this foolhardy shouldn't contain any bonus features on DVD. You would be wrong. Trailers for this film, "The Return," "Double Team," "Desert Heat," "Knock Off," "Maximum Risk," and "Nowhere to Run" showcase the dubious career of Jean-Claude Van Damme. A making of feature, a Van Damme career retrospective (Ha!), a Michael Jai White feature, and talent bios round out the disc. My advice to those viewers thinking of renting "Universal Soldier: The Return"? Run, my friends, run far, far away and don't look back.     
 I couldn't watch this till the end. Bad production values, gimmicky, desperate to make a point about violence and voyeurism and evil and wanting to make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide from the énnui.   If you wanna go all deep thoughts on violence and still get shaken - both intelectually and viscerally - try something like Miike's "Ichi the Killer". Makes this movie look so, so needless.  The leading man looked geeky and occasionally cute. 2 stars for the eye candy 
 Sorry, I am confused why and African-American woman would be so docile and unable to defend herself. How could she not get a drop on the the main character's assistant -- Oh Come On. Anyway, sorry this book did not do much for me 
 I was never drawn into the story.  The writing and editing could have been better.  The distant narrator left me feeling uninvolved, and I never felt or cared anything for the characters.  For a well-written Vietnam story that draws the reader in, read The Proud Bastards 
 Having seen Dead Man Walking, I became interested in seeing more movies about the death penalty so I got a hold of this movie.... I hated it.  The acting was corny and cheesy.  Sean Penn's performance as a condemned  prisoner facing imminent execution was vastly superior and definitely more  convincing than Sharon Stone's.  It beats me why this movie was released  shortly after Dead Man Walking.  In fact, it beats me why it was released  at all.  Stick to Dead Man....don't bother with this extremely lame ripoff 
 I highly recommend the book "The Highly Sensitive Child" by Elaine Aron to get a different perspective (more positive) on the out of sync child 
 I've seen "Arena Rock" used quite a bit to describe Asia.  Although I don't generally agree with the term, I can certainly see where it comes from.  Asia didn't move too far away from its debut release when these tunes were composed.  If you liked their first album, you will likely enjoy this one as well.  For a bit more in-depth coverage, I'll say that I don't like Alpha nearly as much as the debut.  Perhaps it's because I was hoping for a bit of growth and an effort to reach beyond what they accomplished with "Asia".  There are a few somewhat remarkable tunes on this album, though.  I would recommend "Don't Cry" (which everybody has probably heard) and "Eye To Eye".  The best tune on this album, though, has got to be "The Heat Goes On".  It has that same drive and fantastic guitar work from Steve Howe that wooed me with "Time Again" from the first album.  Unfortunately, a few good songs can't lift this album anywhere above a two-star release.  The rest of the songs range from the mediocre (e.g. "The Heat Goes On", "True Colors" and "Open Your Eyes") to the outright painful, such as "My Own Time", "The Last To Know" and "Midnight Sun".  Generally, Steve Howe's presence is much less obvious on this release and is typically replaced with keyboard work from Geoff Downes.  The good thing is that Downes is an engaging artist, albeit not nearly as much as Howe.  This album is probably worth getting if you are a big Asia fan.  Otherwise, beyond their first album, there is plenty of generic '80s rock to go around.  Look elsewhere 
 This pseudo-biography is filled with misinformation, with misquotes (for example, attributing a Poe poem to the wrong story) and to the wildest kind of speculation. It is a scary book, because people who know no better will assume that what these two women write it true--and a good 50 percent of it is either false or based on the wildest speculation 
 LOL!  Christ!  What in God's name was Patterson thinking?  I read this book because I've been trying to check out new authors.  I fell in love with John Sandford's "Prey" novels recently, and on impulse, I picked up Hide and Seek since Patterson is supposed to be so great and I'd heard so much about him.   Boy!  What a disappointment and what a bad first impression!  The book read like one of those Lifetime Movies of the Week.  Basically Maggie Bradford is this woman who has had nothing but bad luck with men.  Husband #1 Beat her, she kills him in self defense.  She later becomes this world class singer . . .even Barbara Streisand pops up in the book to praise her music.  She finally finds true love. . .he dies suddenly.  While this is going on, we get to find out about the second main character a world class athlete named Will Shephard who just happens to be a psycho. . .and yes, you guessed it, she ends up marrying him.  The book is told from two perspectives: 1st Person when the book is focused on Maggie(she's telling you all about her crappy life), and then it switches to 3rd Person whenever the book focuses on Will.  I won't go any further I don't want to spoil it for people unfortunate enough to get around to reading this trite, contrived, soap opera novel that is utterly laughable.  It's sad when the main character is an abused woman and you just don't care about her.  AT ALL.  Oh, and Patterson, what's up with the 100 or so 3 page chapters that this book has?  
 I love other Preston/Childs books so I thought I would love this one.  I didn't.  It is completely predictable.  I was sure that the author would give it some interesting plot twists, but there were none.  And parts of it were ridiculous:  the length of the entombment, the amount of the treasure, the manner of transport, etc.  The only character I really liked was the monkey 
 I read a LOT of books of this genre (and admit to liking chick movies as well), but here's the thing: just because the character is a single 20 or 30-something on the lookout for love does not a story make.  This genre is so popular that the criteria for a story must be low...sell, sell, sell!  The characters are SO FLAT I didn't even care if they got together.  Their relationship was based on sex (we get NO dialogue hardly at all between the two), so why should we root for this affair?  The only character who is vaguely interesting is the "other woman" (his actual wife) and I didn't like her either.  Not only do the characters need depth, but the story draaaaaags on and really doesn't take us anywhere.  There is no richness to the setting.  It's all just cookie-cutter boring.  There is hope!  If you want some good chick lit with character development, try getting some Fiona Walker books and skip this one.  Marian Keyes is fun too (except for Angels).  I just find it hard to identify with an adultress with no personality, I guess!  Please don't waste the money and borrow it if you insist 
 This is how ridiculous this book is -- Fredo is gay.  Yep.  No joke.  That is the big hook.  There is absolutely no suggestion of such a preposterous twist in any of the films (not even in the "king of makes no sense" - Godfather III).  But, Windegardner, perhaps simply to shame the franchise - or perhaps just because he is catering to morons that looovvvee reality t.v. -- decides to add in the preposterous.  Needless to say -- I would recommend watching Godfather III before reading this book.  At least with Godfather III, we can at least blame, in part, a studio that refused to pay Duvall.  Weinegardner has no excuses.    
 I was originally looking forward to the new ideas to promote myself when I purchased this book but many of these ideas have nothing to do with promotion so this book could have served a better service had it only had 100 ideas and gave a little more detail into each 
 Kagan needs to stick with his level of competence which is Napoleonic war.  His NeoCon political beliefs have distorted this book beyond belief and he ends up just being another spokesman for American military might well beyond any kind of reality. No wonder he is an ardent proponent of the "surge" in Iraq.  Read this bok and you will see just how out of touch with the modern military he is 
 First of all I'm upset that I didn't have an option of awarding this disaster zero stars.  But that's another story.  I must be old-fashioned because in my day most vocalists could carry a tune and if they had instruments could play them at the very least with some degree of mediocrity.  The Raincoats are a total mess from the first note and beyond. Anyone who could give this music 5 stars must be brain dead.  I suspect that it's probably fashionable to jump on the bandwagon for a band (and I use the word very loosely) with absolutely no talent.  Getting a root canal with a pneumatic drill would be more entertaining.  Anyone buying this CD should be subject to intense psychotherapy.    
 Erskine Caldwell while apparently wrote during a different time, apparently did nothing to promote anything other than stereotypes of the rural south.  I myself am from a small rural town in Arkansas and grew up with stories my grandparents told of their experiences during the great depression.  They were poor and lived by subsistence farming but they were proud and spoke with a sense of accomplishment of their home life.  While their education and opportunities may have been limited it seemed to make them appreciate what they did have later.  I was surprised to find out that Caldwell had actually lived in the South following my reading the book because he didn't seem to have anything pleasant to say about it at all.  All regions of the country do have impoverished persons who have no ambition to improve themselves nor realize the situation that they're in but this I felt was an unfair take on what was not an easy time for anyone in America.    If you like southern literature, I would much more highly recommend a Willie Morris book, Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Ann Burns, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, maybe one of Shelby Foote's works of fiction, or Eudora Welty amongst others.  In those stories, poverty and racism which are issues in the south are evident but portrayed in a more fair and consistent light.  I will admit in closing that I was interested in the story and finished the book fairly quickly but I felt the content was not all that impressive and only served to deepen stereotypes and preordained views that wrongly exist about the South 
 That should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high-profile cast & normally respectable director are put to.  Another possible title is "It's All About the Groceries", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.  It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  "Kiss the Girls" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.  This movie is worth the price of a rental, but I'd take a pass on purchasing it.  For a better treatment of female-cop-with-dark-secrets-and-Issues, & a stronger movie all-around, I recommend "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock 
 After much much excitement and almost 20 bucks layed out I was extremely disappointed. The music was really slow, boring and rather dull. The songs start to seem like they're the same as the lack ones. Maybe I'm just too used to other trance but I couldnt' find any trance in this cd 
 This debut album by Jo Dee Messina has to be a hit-or-miss.  The best song is "Heads Carolina, Tails Cailifornia", but most of the tracks seem to be weak.  Get "I'm Alright" or "Burn" instead of this one 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 First, let me say that I learned to read from this book. When I was a kid I knew all the words and I loved it! But then again, I didn't know any better, and frankly, neither did my mom and dad. I was lucky in that the book applied to me: I looked like my mom and dad and therefore the message of the book, that your mother is the one who looks most like you, was seemingly harmless.  Now, however, I have an adopted son and am friends with many other families created through adoption, including lots of families with children of different races. The message of this book is really inappropriate for those families and even though my adopted son happens to be physically similar to me, it's not a message I want him to hear, either. Families don't have to look alike to be family!   One of the earlier comments mentions A Mother for Choco by Keiko Kaska and I think this is a MUCH BETTER book than Are You My Mother for ANY child, not just a child in an adoptive or transracial family. The message of that book is that your mother is the one who mothers you...not necessarily the one who looks just like you 
 Listen closely to what others are writing - this is ssssooo basic and poorly recorded that it really is of no help. If you have the book it may be a bit easier. I actually got this for myself to help me with my own pronuciation and you can hardly hear what the young voices are saying. Sorry I got it but my 4 month old niece likes it 
 I bought this book because it was touted as a work that will show how to convert fear into "a source of energy and strength".  Along with personal "journeys" from the authors there are supposed to be inspiring stories from others.  Instead the authors have simply come up with a clever title to obfuscate the fact that this is a  political statement by two radical activists.  Ms. Lappe's personal journeys include her fear of speaking out against the War in Iraq until she was motivated by Moveon.org.  She overcame her fear and joined Senator Kerry's campaign.  I fail to find that particularly inspiring.  It simply makes her one of thousands of people in this country who campaigned for Kerry and speak against the war.  Mr. Perkins blames the policies of the United States Government for the AIDS epidemic in Africa.  I didn't see anything there about overcoming fear, but it was an inspiring example of how far the human imagination can stretch a set of circumstances to try to make a political point.  If you're a Bush-basher who believes the U. S. Government is evil and responsible for all the worlds ills, you might enjoy this book.  If you're looking, as I was, for something to help you face fears and self-doubt in your daily life, I recommend Wayne Dyer's "The Power of Intention" 
 Over the course of their 5 years together, Loggins and Messina released 5 albums of original studio material. The last of these, "Native Sons", was by far the worst. And as much as I loved the first four, listening to this lackluster album makes me think it really was time for these guys to go their separate ways. Though it's not easy to say exactly what is wrong with this album, there are some clear differences from the earlier material. For one thing, there are some personnel changes. Long time collaborators Al Garth (violin, horns) and Michael Omartian (keyboards) are gone. The resulting overall sound is much more lite-rock/pop. The country influences have been downplayed, the band seldom jams, the playing is almost never "hot", and Jimmy Messina's excellent guitar work is barely in evidence. Instead, we get more flute, less sax, more string orchestration. The vocal sound leans more heavily on hired-gun harmonizers. In fact, Messina doesn't sing at all on most of Loggins' songs. To me, it seems that the songwriting doesn't hold up as well, either, although perhaps it is the arrangements that make me feel this way, rather than the songs themselves. A lot of the changes in the sound would later be further amplified on Kenny Loggins' early solo albums, so if you like those a lot you'll probably like this album more than I do. But if, like me, you find Loggins as a solo artist less appealing than Loggins & Messina, then you may very well be better off passing on this one 
 Not enough T&A for me. Michelle Williams didn't show enough. 
 Some reviewers rave about the content of this book, I don't know why.  It presents all of its topics at such a highlevel it's almost useless.  The authors of this book try to fill some kind of weird intermediate state between a digital logic course and a processor implementation course and fail miserably.  The book has not enough detail for either.    The cd-rom, faithfully following the trend of academic textbooks in the US for the past decade, is also completely useless.  The most notable things on the cd-rom are: several sections and a chapter from the book, not included in the text, in pdf, and, wait for it... the SPIM mips emulator.  Wow, now that is some valuable content [/sarcasm].  Any textbook that doesn't provide answers to the exercise problems deservers a zero in my opinion.  I would've given this book a zero, amazon wouldn't let me.  You may be wondering, did I have this book in a course?  Did I fail, is that why I'm so bitter?  No, I made an A actually, but I sure didn't learn much from this book 
 Toby, what were you thinking? Did you really set out to offend over half of your listening audience with this obnoxious song?   This song sucks and the only reason I gave it one star was because I was forced to by Amazon.com.  We already have seven million women and one million men with anorexia in this country and a total of 10 million people suffer from some form of eating disorders. I wonder how many more will join these ranks because of this song.  Incidentally, I USED to be a fan of yours 
 This album sucks.  I wouldn't have given it one star except that i couldn't go any lower.  There is no creativity, the instrumentation is poor, lyrics stupid, and this album is just plain freakin boring.  Don't get me wrong, I love this band.  Loved them for a long time.  Love them for their own quirky, unique style.  But, dang.  They have strayed so far away from who they are it doesn't even need the band name newsboys on it.  Sure, they can say "oh, we were inspired by our heavenly influence to do 'another' worhip album."  It's obvious they just made this one to cash in more on the current "let's all do worship albums" trend.  I have nothing against worhip albums...i loved the last one they did.  This one just plain sucks and i regret i gotta pay the bill on this one.  Mr. Fuller, here's a suggestion.  Go back to the inspiration that you got on Thrive and start from there....cause, dang man...one more like this and the fans will start dropping over dead.  
 This book has a promising start.  Rick Summers, the protagonist of this effort from Frank, has just finished visiting the cemetery to mourn his mom and sister.  He gets into a cab, and immediately finds that his driver has been replaced by a corpse.  A good start, but it's soon downhill from there.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I will talk about what hurts this book.  Most noticably, the dialogue throughout is stilted and mind-numbing.  The characters don't seem capable of any discussion that doesn't focus on flirting, and their deepest statements sound like something a 7th-grader might come up with.  Even their thoughts are boring, especially those of Rick, who seems to spend most of his time thinking about how much he'd like to get every female character in this novel into the sack.  When he's not concentrating on bedding each woman, or thinking about lesbian action, he turns his mind to other important pursuits like drinking.  At points, the book seems like some young man's fantasy life - getting drunk and having sex with hot women.  As for the story, there are a couple of problems.  The first is that much of it is nonsensible.  There are some great ideas, but the author doesn't manage to tie them well together.  Added to that is the pacing, which is erratic.  Too much time is spent on certain parts, which makes it plodding, while interesting scenes are really glossed over.  Again, there are the makings of an interesting story, but they're lost in the clutter.    This one may have been saved had the hero been someone with whom we could sympathize, but he's not.  Really, I couldn't have cared less by book's end about his fate.  This isn't the worst book I've read, but it's not something I would recommend.  
 Clint should be embarrassed.  He made this during his "hot for Sondra Locke" period, which pretty much dooms any movie.  Never mind "Go ahead, make my day" - the big lines here include "only with humans", and Clint's definitive exposition on the proper condiments for a hot dog.  The resolution of the killings (never mind the hilarious impalement) is completely out of character.  It completely contradicts his character's beliefs from the earlier movies.  At least "The Dead Pool", which is a parody, features the killing of Jim Carrey.  
 The Great Wave is what results when someone who does not have any understanding of economics writes economic history.      The author's attempt to equate increases in prices due to catastrophic harvests or plague three to five hundreds years ago with the increase in general prices during the twentieth century to an expansionary monetary policy manages to, at once, understate what has been best about human progress and overstate what has been worst about it. 
 This book is at best confuseing,,,At worst it is junk. I have read every page of this book at least twice. I still find some of the concepts impossible to understand. I will still get a b in the class. But at two hundred dollars per credit hour plus 150 for this trash. I got ripped 
 Maybe at the time it was written I would have reviewed it more favorably. In light of the life Miller led I can't help but to be disappointed by the cheap commericialization of the socialist superiority over capitalist theme that permeates the play. Here Miller creates a character only to destroy that character to point out the ills of capitalism, then Miller spends the rest of his life living an indulgent capitalist life here in the good ole USA: the very capitalist society that was supposedly Willy's oppressor. I think the years have taken the shine off of Miller a bit. I'm sure the Liberal 101 literature professor will disagree 
 Although I found this book a fascinating account of the assassination of Robert Kennedy, I did feel that the author was so bound and determined to make all answers fit the questions regarding the Senator's death regardless of the presentation.  In reading this account, one gets the feeling that the author is so firmly bound to his view that he has narrowed his vision to only one path 
 To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
 yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
 It doesn't get any worse than this. If you have any doubts as to whether Def Jazz is "worth" the trouble-- don't bother. To even call this repulsive mess Jazz is a slap in the face to a genre that has stood fine on it's own without the help of so called fusion Rap/Jazz albums. To the reviewer who named this the best Jazz album ever:     SHAME ON YOU!!!!!! 
 No only are there no heroes in this book there are very few worthwhile words as well. Everyone and everything is painted in a negative light-with the exception of Eddie. Considering he is the "painter" of the book that is not surprising-his bragging style is pathetic at best. According to the book every important person valued him, every idea came from him, every person was using him, every woman wanted him-generous to a fault...........what a phony yarn. I agree w/a quote he used of Debbie's which went something like "the best part of him was his sperm" and would go on to add "fertilized" sperm so only his children get the credit. Simply distasteful 
  Your only option is to get this album. Tears of joy will stream down your face when you listen to this masterpiece. The lyrics are rich and full of meaning that any everyday person can relate to. You will fall to your knees listening to this, and you'll thank God for letting you purchase it. Go out and buy it now, you won't regret it. The lyrics, instrumentation... everything about this album, and this band in general, is brilliant.        OH! I thought I was reviewing an album from Pink Floyd! Not an album from a talentless, manufactured boyband! Avoid N*Sync like they were a plauge, and get the latest album from the Rolling Stones instead. Oh, and make sure you don't listen to that retard Banned And Censored, his mother was drinking while she was pregnet with him 
 The Winner and Absolute  truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
 I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books. 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 The quality is not there and as said in previous review, do not try to "chop up" a classic.  For someone who wants a wonderful Ray Price assortment, true to the LP arrangements but on CD, you might consider a 3 disc collection from:  www.timelessmusic.com which is a lot more Ray Price for the same money.  It is a Sony product and has chrystal clear sound.  I have been a Ray Price fan since "Night Life" and this album is not up to his standards.  That is just my opinion 
 Trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether I like it or not (and if I like it, there most certainly is not a 'bitter' end), I gave up on this one literally halfway through.  Part of me wanted to finish it because I had gotten so far into it, but I gave up and said 'enough.'  This book has so many elements repeating from many other Koontz books, thus it felt like a retread.  I did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger.  I wasn't impressed by his perfect, adorable wife and children, or his career as an author of horror fiction.  And the afterword by the author seemed smug.  I'm sorry I read so much of it before I stopped, but better late than never 
 I was shocked by the poor quality of the writing from such a well-known author.  Though published in 1995, the reader is expected to ignore the then-well-known realities of DNA testing -- for instance, that shared parentage can be proved by comparing the DNA of siblings, not just from putative sibling to parent.  We're also asked to ignore the realities of fingerprint identification when it would have been immediately helpful in revealing an imposter's criminal record and actual identity.    Adding insult to injury, after ignoring the technique when it logically would have come into play, Sheldon brings in fingerprinting at the very tail of the book, in a complicated scenario involving latent prints to identify not the missing heiress, but rather, a private detective!    Every plot development was telegraphed in advance, and the decedent went from being rather interesting in the first few pages to a one-dimensional (and repetitive) demon throughout the rest of the too-long tome.  Even the vocabulary and sentence structure were overly simplistic.  If you want to read the identical plot but done WELL, try "Amanda" by Kay Hooper, also published in 1995.  Hooper has her character do some marvelously stupid things (again, failing to exploit DNA to the fullest in a timely way), but Hooper's vocabulary, syntax, character development and settings are vastly better than the careless work Sheldon provides in "Morning, Noon, & Night."  I read the books only a week apart.  Hooper's work was engaging, though somewhat predictable; Sheldon's was irritating, and ENTIRELY predictable. 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 This movie is very difficult to watch after awhile. Its about a psycho boss but its not funny at all. I didn't laugh through any of the movie. I love dark comedies like election, heathers, to die for, etc but this just didn't work for me. I hated it so much I returned it (lied and said it was a gift). Don't even rent it horrendous 
 I had the same problem as the other reviewer.  This product seemed easy to use but just didn't work right.  It flew up in the air but did not go very high and didn't make very many bubbles.  It actually flew rather erratically and scared my daughter.  After a while, it just kind of pooped out and didn't work 
 I bought this when it first came out,knowing nothing about the chicago mob except the name Al Capone.Even not knowing about Giancana going in I felt there was plenty of nonsense in this book.St.Valentine's Day Massacre?JFK?RFK?Marylin Monroe?Fidel Castro?CIA?You guessed it,Giancana had a hand in all the deaths and controlled the world from his home in Oak Park,Illinois(where he was murdered,by the way).This book is a sham,written by a brother and nephew of Giancana who never let the truth get in the way of the story they tell.If you want a true picture of Giancana's role in the Castro matter,or anything else about him(he was approached by the CIA but never actually did anything except tell Johnny Roselli to string them along),read William Brashler's excellent The Don or William Roemer's Man Against The Mob,two books that have facts,not drivel.Tony Accardo not powerful enough to override a Giancana decision?Guess who had Giancana murdered by Sam's best friend?Accardo,the real boss of Chicago,that's who(not the shadowy govt killer the authors would have you believe) 
 This is another baby-raising advice book that promises THE method to produce a happy, self-confident child. There is some wisom in it (I'm all for respecting children and giving them space to become themselves) but I found the book annoyingly preachy and, in the end, silly. The advice includes: don't touch a child unless you have permission first, don't give a baby any toys to play with on the changing table, don't pick up a crying child, don't let the child eat at the table with adults, don't use strollers, high chairs are off-limits--all that stuff seems a little cultish and ultimately sort of random. Since the approach is guru-driven (like most childrearing methods), there's no real evidence or research presented. Who's to say all this studied ignoring of babies won't produce needy, emotionally distant kids?  Even so, if you're reading every baby book you can get your hands on, this one is worth adding to the pile 
 If you haven't read anything on e-commerce at all, or if you're a total newbie, the latter half of this book may offer some useful advice on how to start an online business. For someone who is already in the business or has already done some research, this book merely repeats a lot of well-known tips. Even then, some of the tips, like in section on affiliate programs, are just theoretical assumptions and projections with very little practical information on how to actually attract sales and traffic.  As for the first part of the book where Allen demonstrates how he could earn $24k in one day, I find it totally unrealistic and it certainly won't happen to anyone reading the book unless he has Robert Allen's background to begin with. Even then, this sort of strategy won't cut it with today's wise and cynical netizens anymore. 
 Our book club so enjoyed Beginners Luck and I was looking forward to reading Last Call.  However, it was a disappointing book  The characters were poorly developed and the point of view was one of the reasons why. Was there one?   One never felt close to the characters or really cared what happened to them.  To me the only chapter well written was the last chapter where Joseph delivers to the readers, a 20 years later, epilogue.   There were a few funny incidents, but much of the dialogue was tired.  This book reads on about the 5th grade level   Sorry Laura, but I don't think you put much effort into this one.  Furthermore, the book was poorly edited.  Appeared choppy 
 I waited weeks for this book to be available and was very energized to make fabric boxes--thought this would be my Christmas present for everyone.  But perhaps one needs the experience of making fabric bowls first because I was not successful.    One has to navigate through a lot of narrative to establish a shopping list. I had many false starts because the book is not clear enough on the specific products one MUST use.  In many cases the photos do not match the adjacent narrative and at times photos show processes that are not described at all. Oh, I wish I had the same experience as the the positive reviewer. Unfortunately, after investing 6 hours, plus hours of shopping time, I still do not have a completed quality product. I am not a beginner sewer or crafter and yet, find this book does not stand alone to instruct someone new to this type of project 
 First, let me say that by quality film standards this is a terrible movie, in many respects. I live to walk on videos of this type with football cleats. But, this movie falls into the "I hated this movie so much, I couldn't help but watch it whenever it was on" category. And now I love it. I don't know what it is about this movie. I tried to put my finger on it many times. I always have and always will hate "Sleepless in Seattle," which is a totally contrived load of crap. But "You've Got Mail" has an undefinable charm to it that forces you to look past it's simplified portrayal of a happy go lucky, skip around the neighborhoods of New York atmosphere. It makes you question why you buy into such sappy dialogue and situations. It's not just because of the Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks chemistry, because I hated the despicable "Sleepless in Seattle" and always thought the entire premis of "Joe Versus the Volcanoe" was a joke. But in this movie, contrived as it may be, that interplay between the two works. Though their acting is also hammy at best, I also love the contributions of Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Stephen Zahn and Jean Stapleton. This is one of my guiltiest pleasures. I'll only watch it with the remote on toggle to some type of sports programming in case my friends walk in on me while I'm watching it so I can jump inmmediately to the "Binford Lumberjack Finals," or something like that. But were they to walk in at the end of this movie and find me glossy eyed with a lump in my throat, I'd never hear the end of it. I love this movie. There! I admit it. 
 It is advertised as a pant set,but it came as a capri set.It has a lacy thing around the neck that is extremely uncomfortable 
 Skepticism  can be healthy, but this book is an error-filled celebration of hollow, misleading cynicism delivered with a surprising level of shallowness and lack of detail.  Sure this book points out some "legitimate" frauds and hoaxes, but it does a lot of damage and leads people astray by suggesting that a lot of things are frauds and hoaxes that are not. It seems that Mr. Randi concludes that anything and everything he doesn't understand or have proof of is a fraud or hoax. One example: acupuncture.  Never mind that thousands,  if not millions of people have been helped and healed by acupuncture, but even the American Medical Association has concluded that it is a legitimate medical therapy. But Randi includes it in his list of frauds and hoaxes.   There are many other examples where Randi errs and misleads, or simply does not understand and chooses to cast aspersions (p on) what he is woefully ignorant about. In some cases he cites individuals who have supposedly exposed frauds or disproven claims and theories, but the reader is left with little or no details to assess the claims of the "fraud buster."    In other cases, a supernatural feat is presumed to have been disproven simply because someone else has managed to appear to replicate the supernatural feat by using sleight-of-hand or other trickery.    Not everything that is real and true can or needs to be proven by science or  proven to Mr. Randi. (A large portion of the history of science, in fact, is a history of proving that what science once concluded was unreal or unprovable is in fact real.)  If you accept on face value  everything that Mr. Randi wants you to accept, your life will be much poorer for it.   This book will provide great reassurance for people who don't want to believe in anything other than their egos. As stated above, this book is a great example of where skepticism has fallen victim to cynicism and that makes this book more harmful than helpful.  To a great extent,  I am very surprised and sorry to conclude, this book itself is a fraud 
 The minute I took it out of the box I knew I would return it. And that was before I even opened the book! The pages aren't numbered but it appears to have about 25 pages in it. Taking the price into consideration that comes to almost $1 a page. Additionally, inside there are many blank areas to write your ideas on so ultimately I was spending $19.95 for a note pad. Too bad. Everyone else seemed to love the ideas the author presented. I couldn't get past the feeling of being cheated to even read her ideas 
 By this book, 1940 marked the time that photography died and was replaced by vast amounts of performance art.  Can you seriously present a "survey" of contemporary art without even acknowledging photography in any form?  
 I'm a huge Bone fan, but this prequel was a letdown.  Sniegoski isn't nearly as good a writer as Jeff Smith.  The story is repetitive, the humor falls flat, and the dialogue is terrible.  The talking monkey is particularly annoying, and has about five times as many lines as necessary.  The story doesn't compliment the original series in the way that the excellent Rose series does.  Also, the final third of the book is Riblet, a story about a baby boar who beats up rat cratures.  Riblet is just...bad.  It's drawn by Stan Sakai of Usagi Yojimbo fame, who really can't hold a candle to Jeff Smith for draftsmanship.  Smith's typically excellent artwork in the first part of the book is the best thing about this volume, which is otherwise superfluous 
 Petra of all places. Supernatural protection, persecution, on ad naseum. The one drug on, and on, and on,  and on ......  Same tired story, persecution by Carpathia a lame attempt at evil incarnate and his lackies. Sorry..   I think the series denegrates Christianity rather then exalting it.   I've read all 12 and found it morose and condemning. The opposite of how I view Christianity is. 
 This is a tough read.  He gets so bogged down in the details that I forgot what I was reading about 
 Tihs Album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day. I like all his other albums better I don't Know why he decided to release this crap.But the only song I really Like is hip hip qurtables 
 The book, as the title suggests, purports to explain some factors influencing health in terms of chemical principles, such as acid/base balance. However, there are serious errors in the book on the chemical facts that are fundamental. For example, the authors state that oxygen is beneficial because oxygen is alkaline. Outright wrong because molecular oxygen is by no means basic (a better term for ¡°alkaline¡±), or alkaline, in any sense of the acid-base definitions. In other parts of the book they claim ozone is good for health. The fact is that ozone in the breathing air is very harmful to our pulmonary system. Ozone is chemically active and generates radicals to the extent of being toxic in the low concentrations. It is almost criminal to advocate use of ozone generators in the living environment 
 By setting her story in Manhattan, among the literary elite, Claire Messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities," which described upper-class life in Manhattan among the Wall Street elite, so exquisitely that character descriptions from his 1987 book ("master of the universe" and "social skeleton") became part of our vocabulary.   Claire Messud is no Tom Wolfe. "The Emperor's Children" describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of "The Emperor," a famous writer.  Unlike "Bonfire of the Vanities," this book has no compelling narrative - the "voice" shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want, who they need and who they love or hate and why.  Trust me, you won't care.  Meanwhile, the "Emperor" lopes along as a literary lion past his prime.  The characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals (the "Emperor" betrays his wife with his daughter's best friend, the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the "Emperor" etc. etc.) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on September 11, 2001.  But we never learn how September 11 affected Messud's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere.     
 Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. Some "intellectuals" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding 
 This second sequel to "Darkman" maintains the visual style of the first two, has great music, a few good action moments, and a very good performance from Arnold Vosloo as the hero. These are the four things I liked most about "Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die," which isn't a bad movie, but it's not very good either. I'm not only a fan of Darkman, I'm also a fan of Sam Raimi, Liam Neeson, and Arnold Vosloo. Given this, I was sad to see Raimi and Neeson leave the franchise, but am thankful for Vosloo's performance. He does a great Darkman/Westlake and the sequels, especially this movie, have him to thank. While the second was a great follow-up, this film is a little on the stupid side. Jeff Fahey, overacting in every scene, plays bad guy Peter Rooker, who is a drug dealer who is after Darkman when a large sum of money is stolen from him. The plot digs deeper into Rooker's life and soon Darkman is disguising himself as Rooker and befriends his wife and daughter. Darkman soon makes a vow that he will not get involved with the family, that he is only after Peter. But soon Darkman's light side gets the better of him. The movie is bleeding with predictable moments and painfully awful one-liners. Thankfully, director Bradford May keeps a dark, violent tone to the movie and mostly keeps the movie serious about itself. There are a few unintentionally funny moments, more so than in the second, and this hurts the movie a little. I suppose the reason to see this film is if you liked the first two. I did, and gladly added this one to my collection. I have no regrets about it, but take fair warning: only fans will enjoy this one. Everyone else will be in the dark 
 I am really disapointed by this book: the example drawings are ugly!! 
 It warms ok, not great. But the worst thing is, the massage is LOUD! I work at home, in my basement, where it gets cold, and was thrilled to get this to keep my feet warm, and was excited to get massage too. However, I can't use the massage feature while I am on the phone - it is way too loud. And there is no control on the heating element, just on and off. A disappointment. I still use the heat feature, but also wear thick socks 
       This encyclopedia is for true believers in the Post Keynesian tradition of Joan Robinson,G L S Shackle and Paul Davidson.Unfortunately, this approach to economics can't operationalize any of the analytic tools and concepts Keynes developed in  the A Treatise on Probability in 1921(TP)or in the General Theory in 1936(GT).An obvious place to start is the failure of Post Keynesians to operationalize Keynes's concepts of the weight of the evidence in the TP,uncertainty in the GT and probability in both the TP and GT.Keynesian probability is fundamentally of an interval nature.It is quantitative and at the same time noncomparative,nonrankable,and incommensurable if any of the interval estimates overlap.The source of this analysis is chapters 15,17,20,and 22 of the TP.Weight of the evidence,w,is an index that measures the completeness of the relevant,potential,available evidence upon which probability estimates will be based.Keynes defined it as 0<=w<=1.If w=0,then you are dealing with what Keynes called ignorance in the TP.A w=0 would also hold in the 1937 Quarterly Journal of Economics article if"We simply do not know!"Other names would be complete or total uncertainty or the fundamental uncertainty of the Shackles and the Davidsons.w's between 0 and 1 represent cases of partial knowledge and partial ignorance.Here a set of different probability distributions or a set of intervals would have to be constructed.A w=1 allows a decision maker to specify a single unique probability distribution or interval.Given a strict application of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers,suppose that the data passed the Lexis Q-test for stability.Keynes would then agree that one could apply a normal probability distribution since an analysis of the data would support such a conclusion as long as the data was homogeneous in its composition throughout the series or sequence.Now let us turn to the GT.Keynes was quite clear that uncertainty is a function of the weight of the evidence.As the weight of the evidence increases,uncertainty decreases.As the weight of the evidence decreases,uncertainty increases.u=f(w).If w=0,then uncertainty is total and no estimates of probability are possible.In this case,the decision maker would exhibit a very high liquidity preference and tend to rely on heuristics,rules of thumb,habits,memory,conventions or a follow the crowd approach 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  The author confuses inflammation with insulin resistance, and ends up with a mish-mash of ratings that make the mistake of trying to combine the two.  There are already two great eating plans for insulin resistance, The Zone and South Beach.  However, an anti-inflammatory diet is very different: foods like tomatoes, for example, should not be part of an anti-inflammatory eating plan.  So I would suggest that readers looking for a true anti-inflammatory diet book, skip this one and instead take a look at The Anti-Inflammation Diet and Recipe Book, by Jessica K. Black, ND.  You will find there lots of great recipes and a much more helpful (and accurate) table of "Foods to Eat" and "Foods to Avoid".  
 What a disappointment! I absolutely loved The Black Pearl but was admittedly  nervous about a sequel. As it turned out, I had every reason to be. It whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original, major or minor, who seemed interesting. That they did but, unfortunately, the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say.  Depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while Keira must have, somehow, pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie. Legolas, I mean, Orlando Bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along, sometimes good but more often, haphazardly. To my mind, the only real interesting addition was that of Davey Jones. Except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying (due to the tentacles 'n all), at least his was a unique addition to the movie. I do sort of object, however, to associating him with the Flying Dutchman legend. The two have nothing to do with each other, fantasy or not. And don't get me started on the cannibals!  Any way, I think this movie merits the two y'ars I gave it. While considerably beneath that first movie, it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times, but it is most definitely not as good.  And, as a final thought, the very last scene of the movie? Lose it entirely. It simply was unnecessary.  
 I ordered this magazine as a gift, and, so far, the first two issues have been sent to me rather than to the intended gift recipient.  There must be a better way to handle gift subscriptions.  I supplied the address of the gift recipient when I placed this order.  The same thing happened last year, and I do not intend to order gifts from Amazon again 
 As has been mentioned above, I really wanted to like this book.  We chose it for our Jewish book discussion club.  I found it very disappointing.  It was plotless and focused on such silly pointless things (the details of sexual encounters) instead of the rich historical surroundings.  At least it did not engage me at all and I'm astonished to read so many glowing reviews.  I learned nothing from the book.  Every time it verged upon a great story it veered back to the plodding go-nowhere writing.  Sorry. Didn't like it.   
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 The light was very good, the magnifier (very tiny) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses.  But the worst part were the tweezers in themselves.  They were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle.  Also, I am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair.  These did not.  So they do not tweeze well at all.  Wasn't worth all the bother of a return.  I just threw it away.  It was a good idea for a product, just poorly made.  
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, why can't all this people professing to believe him just listen to him.  When Jesus was about to die as a human being he cried to his God.   Matthew 27:46, ".... My God My God why have you forsaken me?"  He prayed to his God why can't you.    Jesus also told us how to pray.  Our Father who art in heaven, hollowed be thy name....  Jesus never said to pray to him.  In Jesus name we need to pray through him because of his ransom sacrifice but that's another story.  Still though, you pray thourgh Jesus Christ **TO** his God and Father Jehovah.  Don't waste your money on this book, read the Bible and find out what it says.  Ron Rhodes can not bring you closer to God.    If you are really curious ask Webster instead.  Look up the name Jehovah in a dictionary 
 GRitS are at their best when the underlying foundation of a song is a strong (catchy) melody. Witness "They All Fall Down," and "Here We Go." On "Redemption," Coffee and Bone seemed to have abandoned their original purpose of making the most innovative hip-hop in the industry and have made an album that merely bites what is on the playlist of any top 40 rap station in the country. Under the guidance of the production team of Otto Price and Ric Robbins, collectively known as Incorporated Elements, GRitS made their most memorable hits: all of which followed the above-mentioned formula. Now these 3 albums, made after their departure/dismissal, have exposed Bone and Cof's greatest weakness: the inability to make compelling beats. - FYI: Pigeon John makes "Open Bar" the strongest track.       
 I was highly disappointed with this audiobook. I had been expecting it to open up a personal insight into the author's experiences that others could perhaps relate to and help them cope with tragic personal loss. Instead it was chock full of copious detail about irrelevant and meandering topics that showcase Ms. Didions outstanding literary research capabilities, travel and life experiences, but deny the listener an insight into her real feelings and experiences.   I kept listening hoping to warm to the author (I was trying very, very hard to do so let me tell you) and empathize with her experiences but she kept the reader very firmly at arms distance in their place from start to finish. This audiobook is full of so many facts and figures (all in a  minutia of detail) that is reminiscent of a writer who is a talented Googleer and research technician, but who can't relate to real people in a down to earth manner.    The end product is a meticulously detailed and clinical exposition that has the warmth of a bag of ice.  
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 I was expecting a really great story when I bought this book.  I've been watching the TV show Lost since it first aired, and I thought that reading this book would be a fun way to find some tidbits and clues about the backstory of the television program.  While the story was mildly interesting, the pages were filled with cliches and poor delivery.  I would have bene much happier with the book if I had known that prior to buying it.  I still would have purchased the book because of its connection to the television show, but I wouldn't have been expecting a well told mystery to come with the package 
 "With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. "  "Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit."  It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however 
 Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own 
 I had the Lonely Planet and my friend had the Rough guide and the difference was quite great.  The section on the Mekong Delta for example was vastly more in depth in the LP and I would have been totally lost if I had used the Rough Guide 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 This book is soooo terrible! not worth reading AT all! First off, you have this image in your head of this guy and a girl... but Frank gets these people in HIS very own sdtory mixed up.... the genders you never are quite sure of since one is suppose to be a girl, but suddenly changes to "he says" "she says" crap! Frank get your chacacters sexes' straight before right a book. This was the biggest waist of time in my life to even read a sentance of any of his books! Just absolutely terrible!!!!!!!!!! Read it and waist time and money on something as pathetic as this book, you'll see what i mean. 
 I purchased the backpack and thought the many compartments would be great.  However there is not as much room for documents and folders and I thought.  The padding is great for laptop protection.  The backpack is very heavy and hurts my back when carrying through an airport.The style and look is good function is poor 
 Simply put, the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely. There are always bubbles.  If you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you.  The keyboard soft material cover is not so bad, but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard.  So, when you close the lid, the material then transfers some of that dirt right back.  My resolve...just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft, clean, semi-wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster 
 I read this book as part of my seminary training.  To be honest it was a waste of money.  The topic is a non-starter. Hell either exists as Jesus, the bible, Muslims, Jews have taught for many thousnads of years, Or it DOSEN"T.  If it does, then you better be prepared, if it doesn't then why worry. Dr Walvoord's view is the classic biblical treatment of Hell.  It is well written and his concern for humamity and their decision it ignore the facts is well presented.  The other three views are well presented but NOT supported, by anything other than simply saying so.  If you want to waste your money and time, then good ahead and buy this.  If you want to know the truth, just read the source material- The BIBL 
 McCarthy is a very talented writer (read Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses) but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing, using many archaic words. Suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot. Despite the novel's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character. Certain chapters are interesting (the workhouse chapter especially), but these passages are few and far between. Also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way. McCarthy writes about nature beautifully, but after finishing this book, one is left unfulfilled. 
 The Civil War ended over 150 years ago. Civil rights are now a matter of law. 911 shows us the results of this type of intolerance. Why do these authors attempt to perpetuate a "racial" orientation that can no longer be supported? The South no longer "lives"; it is time to move into the 21st century 
 Heidegger endeavour is like to examine the condition of whiteness in general.  Being is not more real and substantive than whiteness. It is just a category, a verbal shorcut.  If per chance is philosophically useful, it is only on the most shallow, no deeper sense.  Of course you can write -as he did- more or less moving pages about the condition of the human being, the "dasein", but that does not get us one step nearer some kind of ontological certainty.  If someone like that kind of writting, I advice the Science of Logic by Hegel, 100 times more interesting and inspiring, although not an inch more convincing 
 Didn't like the way these boots fit. The souls were really lumpy and you could feel it when you walked. They also looked really wierd on, they flattened out really wide and felt like your foot would slipp off of them sideways. Returned them and paid for the shipping myself 
 I thought Keegan was a "serious" historian.  This book contains little to do with the actual war itself - you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel - indeed I beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a "serious" miltary analysis of the iraq war 
 Reading "Understanding Digital Photography" by Bryon Peterson is a bit like being at a family get-together, and being given a lot of good advice by friendly Uncle Phil over a couple of beers. Then you later discover that friendly Uncle Phil didn't know what he was talking about! It does mar what was otherwise a good experience.  What makes me think of a family get-together is the folksy, jocular tone and the amusing comparisons between technical subjects and familiar things. Here are a few of Bryan Peterson's more colorful attempts at making digital photography understandable:  - The pixels on the sensor work together like a family, like socialism, and it's too bad Stalin and Mao Tse-tung couldn't see this (pg 16).  - JPEGs are like amnesia or like AM radio or like prepared meat loaf (pg 18, 20).  - TIFFs are like elephants (pg 19).  - ISO is like caffeine, and high ISO is like bloodshot eyes (pg 22).  - Long exposure times cause the pixel family to fall apart and have a nervous breakdown (pg 78).  - Checking the background is important, although typically not done regarding the person you're going to marry (pg 96).  - Over-sharpening a picture makes it glow, which could be used to guide Santa Claus and Rudolph (pg 129).  This style of writing may appeal to some people, but it's definitely not my cup of tea.  The book is richly illustrated with a lot of photographs taken by Bryan Peterson. These pictures do a good job of presenting the various techniques being discussed, and they are all good pictures from a purely technical point of view.  However, my aesthetic opinion of most of the pictures is fairly low, i.e., they are not the kind of pictures that I'd like to be able to make someday.  Bryan Peterson favors very colorful photos, and he admits that he pushes the color saturation up on most of his pictures. The composition and subjects of many of his pictures leave a kind of artificial taste, as if the pictures were being made just for the sake of making pictures that will impress.  Of course, taste is something that is very individual, and Bryan Peterson is a successful professional photographer so there are obviously many people who like his pictures.  The most serious problem with this book is the large number of technical errors concerning digital photography. Here are some of the more serious examples:  - "... the more pixels the merrier" (pg 16). Only true up to a point.  - "Every time you open and close a JPEG file on your computer, the file degrades due to data being lost..." (pg 18). Not true, and Bryan Peterson's warnings against using JPEGs are mostly incorrect.  - White balance should always be set to "Cloudy+3" (pg 26). Poor advice, especially when photographing people because of the need to get skin colors correct.  - Landscapes should be shot at f/22 (pg 34) and macros at f/32 (pg 118). This doesn't take the light diffraction problem into account.  - Depth of field properties of a lens are independent of sensor size (pg 39 and 119). Not true.  - Noise reduction should be done last in post processing (pg 57). No, it should be done first.  - Clean the sensor with compressed air (pg 127). No, this can damage the camera.  - Take pictures under-exposed by 3 stops in order to stack 8 of them in Photoshop (pg 148). Crazy advice, you should change the opacity of the layers instead.  - "The output size of that file ... will be around 2048 x 3000 ppi (pixels per inch) ..." (pg 156). Meaningless statement.  Bryan Peterson tells us that he shot film for many years and only recently switched to digital. This book was obviously written before he had learned enough about digital photography to explain it properly.  So, I don't like the tone of the writing and I don't particularly like the pictures and I don't think Bryan Peterson's knowledge of digital photography was up to the task. What did I like about this book?  Actually, the basic concepts regarding photography that Bryan Peterson describes are good. The importance of getting the picture right when shooting it (as opposed to Photoshopping it later), the way in which aperture and shutter speed affect the picture, the importance of how a picture is illuminated and composed, the value of using a tripod; all of this material represents the core concepts of photography that need to be learned in order to be able to consistently take good pictures.  Another thing I appreciated was that Bryan Peterson says that understanding the technology isn't the most important aspect of being a good photographer. "... 99% of all successful photographic images have relied on ... setting a creatively correct exposure and ... creating a well-balanced and compelling composition" (pg 10). This book is inadvertent proof that a lack of technical knowledge does not prevent a person with the proper basic knowledge of photography from taking good pictures.  Still, for a book that is targeted at those who want to learn about digital photography, the many errors disqualify it.  Rennie Peterse 
 While entertaining, I found several times that the story slowed down and got a little preachy about the politics of drug money. While probably true it distracted from the story by being repeated and heavy handed. I also found the timeline hard to believe. Maybe because I have lived in the area and understand the distances (and traffic) travelled in short periods of time. I am a big Elizabeth Lowell fan  (as well as Ann Maxwell) but this was not one of her better books 
 This album, a great one i must say. Features one of their previous drummers who is known for his bell work on the cymbals. Listen to Sinister Mephisto to get what i mean. A good album for any melodic death metal fan. If you like In Flames, Opeth, Soilwork, or any other swedish death metal outfit, check Arch enemy out. You will not be disapointed 
 People desperately wanted to see Olivia and John reunite after the success of Grease.  The dismal Grease 2 sequel came out with no sign of them, so someone had the idea of re-teaming them for something completely different.  TWO OF A KIND is a silly plot about two people who are destined to meet thanks to the good lord above, and through some silly scenarios we are supposed to believe they will.  The acting is absolutely shocking (not just from Olivia). Perhaps the only saving grace is the average single "Twist of Fate". This is not a cult classic, make no mistake.  It is easily one of those "hall of shame" films.  I cannot believe that there are reviewers out there who like this joke of a film 
  "Kings and Queen" is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.    The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie.  The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live.  The other story involves a young man named Ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party.  After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship.  With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, "Kings and Queen" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships.  It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching.  But, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on.  Even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over.  For instance, Nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours.  Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father.  Nora could be accused of being  confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place?  I don't think so.  Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom.  But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here.  This is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the audience on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves the viewer no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.   
 I bought this book to learn more about MJ's last comeback in Washington. And truth to tell the book does give details and information, what I didn't really want to read about was a man griping about his job following a "demigod" in his words. It would have been more credible if you saw both sides of the coin but it was obvious Leahy just wanted to focus on the negatives. You get the feel that he was shooting down a hero to earth because people "worship" him too much, blindly at that too. I got the info but I am almost sorry I bought this book. The author just kept griping sometimes selfishly making the book actually about himself and the work he had to do. Why do it if you don't like it? He makes a very embarrasing account of the Bull's 3rd championship saying Paxon's winning shot came from Mj. It came from Grant, basketball fans know this. This is an auhor who doesn't get it. Heroes are there because we aspire to be like them, they tell us if you put forth the effort, anyone can and is special. Leahy says "why do people worship/ are blinded by heroes when they have as much crap as everyone?". Leahy has manged to cash in on a hero by "exposing" his bad side. That is something I cannot aspire to. If truth was his goal he should have been more neutral. Jordan's not a God, we do not worship him or believe he is above mortals, the fact that he IS LIKE everyone yet pushed himself (and others) to be the best is what we admire him for 
 I was listening to the Audio Version of this book on CD on a drive. I was left wondering "where's Al Giordino?" the whole time, granted, my husband and two-year-old were entertaining each other with a game of "Got Your Nose!" the first 50 miles or so (quite a noisy game, so I might have missed some of the most important parts). I was thoroughly confused until Summer Pitt, his sister, made an appearnace, and I realized this wasn't the original Dirk Pitt they were writing about, just a "clone" if you will, supposedly-- his son. They were almost identical in description, asides from age. It would be a little more realistic for a son to be his own person with his own personality and slightly different looks. I was dissappointed by this. It ruined the entire story for me. And then, the REAL Dirk Pitt was introduced on the last disk as the old man who was the Director of NUMA, now, succeeding Sandecker. That was confusing enough. One good thing I can say for Clive is Dirk aged through the novels, which was realistic. I get annoyed when I read book after book about heros who never get older 
 First she said Teri Schiavo should have Congress decide when she dies.  Now she comes out against Michael J. Fox and stem cell research.  This clueless and unattractive woman knows no shame. She's a terrible actress and writer 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 I heard "Heart of Mine" in the closing credits for the movie Runaway Jury.  After listening to the album, I found that was really the only tune I liked.  Peter Malick is a veteran of the hard-charging James Montomery Band (who I have seen tear up stages of Northeast blues clubs), which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me.  You could argue that he is going for a "relaxed" feel, to which I would repsond he succeeds all too well.  Norah Jones can sing, and sing well- no argument there, but these songs are not great.  The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper.  For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful.  Having said all this, "Heart of Mine" is an excellent record, and might even be worth the price of the CD.  Of course, to get the one good track, you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite MP3 site. 
 I was unfortunate enough to receive this book as a "gift" from my mother (along with Where Does a Mother Go to Resign").  As a gay Christian (yes, a GAY Christian), I find Mrs. Johnson's writings decidedly disturbing and un-Christian.  The Bible does NOT clearly condemn gay people (if one researches historical and language origins of Biblical writings) and to base her reaction to her gay son on Christian beliefs is just wrong.  So yes, I think that makes this a bad book 
 Sugrue takes a look at one of the crisis to hit not only Detroit but the rest of the country in his book on race and inequality. While there have been a lot of disturbing factors that have occurred during urban renewal Sugrue takes his text a little far. His flagrant bashing of urban planning gets old after the first two chapters and the book tends to drag on. This is an important issue that bears further studying but hopefully it will be done in a more academic way. This book does have all the information you need to start studying the subject and is a good way to begin looking at urban renewal.   
 I was instantly intrigued by this book. I was disappointed that of the 242 pages, it take until page 181 for him to decide to even play Traumerei for his wife.  Quite frankly, this book is filled with self indulgant nonsense. If Adams had stuck to the idea of writing a book about just learning piano , it would have been fine. Instead he meanders onto subjects such buying boats and taking trips. What does any of that crap have to do with playing piano?  I think Noah Adam's experience is very indicative of the "I want everything now with little work" philosophy that pervades our country. I have very little doubt that the exquisite Steinway he bought has either been sold or is gathering dust. What a shame.  
 If this book is fictional as even the people who are crazy about it admit, then how could they take it as historic fact? The degree of emotionalism involved by the Armenian reviewers here is phenomenal. It's almost as though this supposed genocide is a religious experience, and the truth needs to be damned.    An Ara Belian (Feb. 4, 2004) is upset at the revelations of another reviewer, whose essay made a lot of sense to me. He counts on stories by relatives as his evidence... but nobody is arguing Armenians did not suffer. The point is, everyone suffered during those tragic times. Didn't Armenians kill Turks in large numbers, that we never hear about? (Why are there no Turks in Armenia, when once the Turks were the majority?)    The point is whether a governmental extermination policy was in effect; this is the unproven part of genocide theory, and emotionalism is an unfair substitute for history.  All the "documented evidence, witnesses and memoirs of the genocide" prove is that ugliness occurred during what was a state of war. That's why none of it was admissible as actual evidence when the British attempted to try the Turks for massacre crimes at the end of WWI.    Taking the moral high road by claiming numbers don't matter is awfully ingenuous of Belian when propagandists make sure to tell us numbers do matter... the higher the number, the greater the sympathy value. That's why false numbers as 1.5 million have been created. Instead of saying he was made to "fume and filled ...with anger," why doesn't Mr. Belian THINK? Approach this subject coolly, rationally and without emotion? Instead of acting like a religious zealot who doesn't care about reason and common sense?  
 This is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal. But the mistake goes more long, because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole 
  The good thing about this movie is that it didn't last more than it did. Not that it's bad, no, it's a fine depressing movie. It may be very well acted -Duvall is great all right-, with nice songs perhaps, well directed if you like... But unless you feel identified with these characters -and I don't- there's no way you can enjoy watching this.   This is what I saw: All the characters here are self-centered individuals, conceited, self-pitying, deplorable and depressing. Duvall plays a drunk who quits drinking to start (perhaps) a new life. That he in the past was a sucessful country singer makes no difference to me, it just adds to his self-pity. I couldn't find anything positive in this story. Even the kids that show are aggravating with their persistent questions.   The picture we have here is that of a bunch of losers and dreamers. Everybody seems to blame someone else for his miseries. The children their parents, the wives their ex-husbands (& viceversa). Death, either thru war or car accidents, plays a major role too. It seems people have trouble getting over it, looking for someone to blame it on. Then the scenes in the church... I'm not sure what they are intended for. The three main characters (Duvall, Harper and the kid) go to church; him and the kid even get baptized, but they have no idea what church is all about; to them it's a social ritual (a tradition, a superstition?). This is not a movie about faith. It's about the troubles of these guys; the lady needs a man because she's young and lonely; the man needs... he needs to grow up; the kid needs a father and some homework. Nobody cares for others, only for themselves.  Honestly, the irony about this movie is that it's so realistic and its characters so phony. I understand why Duvall went immediately to make 'The Apostle', where he plays a role opposite to this one 
 I used it about 10 times in 2 years and it did the job well. Used it as blower and mulcher and was pretty happy with the results. Unfortunately now it smells like burnt everytime i use it. I opened it up the other day and it looks the like motor collectors are giving up. Not an expesive tool but it should have lasted more than 2 years of light use 
 I wanted to really like this book--it had a great sounding premise, that's why I bought it without checking with other book readers first. I had to force myself to read until the end. I found the way the characters went from one reality to the next to be unbelievable. Also, I didn't get to know and care about the characters. 
 It workED fine first month then it get slower and slower , sometimes I could only get  20 Kbp/s, turn it off and back on again, performance get much better for couple hours and then it slow down again. Faulty product! Downloading from the same website, my sister got 900Kbp/s , I got max 200 Kbp/s(after turn off and back on). Disapointed !!! 
 when you're exposed to faulty education check out this book! this book will teach you from top to bottom what needs to be done...in theory. Moreover, it has sample cases and lots of procedures written by the authors themselves. For those majoring in Software engineering  this is a must have! 
 It is often fun to overly critize films made in other decades that often reflect a different attitude to what worked for audiences then.  My memory of this film as a teenager stands up better than my views upon seeing this DVD resurrection. For instance, as soon as I saw the name Kurt Krasner in the credits this time, I recalled that it was a common practice to use certain actors over and over again, even though they were badly miscast each and every time.  Mr. Krasner is cast as a French policeman in Timbuktu.  The actor was often cast in exotic, foreign sounding roles.  The problem was that, in Legend of the Lost, he never attempted a French accent.  In fact, he never changed his accent or his delivery in any of his films. Ever! The fight scenes between Brazzi and Wayne (there are far too many of them) are amaturish; one camera angle actually shows Brazzi throwing a punch that misses Wayne's jaw by a good 12 inches!  Where was the director, Henry Hathaway, a seasoned vertan, when this happened?  The soundtrack element used for this DVD transfer was very poor; it has a thin, tin-like quality.  I've heard better in the various TV versions of this film. I find that to be true of many DVD's.  I'm glad I rented this DVD rather than simply relying on my memory and buying it outright.  That saved me some hard-earned money 
 I thought the original was pretty good, but this sequel was pure torture to watch! I'de rather eat a giant roach, than watch this movie again! Without question, one of the worst comedys ever written 
 This was bought for my son for a babyshower gift. He really doesn't play with it. It doesn't do much. I also had a hard time opening the part where you put in the batteries. I was not happy with it. 
 first of all, i am a christian.  and an evangelical, no less.  i share my faith on a regular basis.  in fact, it's currently my career.  i do not say these things to brag, but just to clarify that i'm not a "liberal agnostic," or whatever monsters we're all scared of, who's writing just to attack the christian worldview.  that said, my main point is not that books like this distract us from the essence of christianity: serving each other, living nonviolently and sacrificially, giving to the poor (it's appalling that we have starving people in a nation that fundamentalists claim was founded to be a christian nation--which it wasn't, but still, it's appalling), and loving all unconditionally (you know, agape, a concept that appears numerous times in the new testament while "dating" never appears).  my main point is also not that books like this turn christians into relational hypochondriacs who constantly second-guess their very natural romantic and sexual impulses, which could easily be controlled with simple common sense, and turn every natural human relationship into something forced, stilted, and unnatural.  i also do not wish to focus on the fact that the idea of "pre-marital sex" appears nowhere in the bible.  seriously, it's not there.  "adultery" (i.e. infidelity) and "sexual immorality" (i.e. promiscuity and depravity) are there, but consummating a loving, monogamous relationship (gasp!) BEFORE a formal and symbolic ceremony takes place just does not appear in the bible.  in fact, in the days of the biblical hebrews, having sex for the first time equalled getting married.  no ceremonies.  in fact, jewish marriage ceremonies are adaptations of medieval christian ceremonies which were themselves adaptations of pagan ceremonies.  if you don't believe me, read adin steinsaltz's "the essential talmud."  so, in biblical times there essentially was no such thing as "pre-marital sex."  but, as i said, all those things are not my point.  my point is, i'm 24.  i don't know anything about life.  at 21, i knew even less.  isn't it a little odd that the evangelical world is totally revamping its idea of relationships because of what an inexperienced 21 year-old is saying?  i mean, that just seems a little odd to me.  totally my opinion 
 You must know by now, the prize for determining longitude at sea prior to satalites, etc. A race between the sextant types (astronomy) and the creation of a clock that does not lose time at sea(now available at all malls). If your interest lies with navigation, as does mine, this isn't your book.  If your interest lies in the historic quest for the perfect clock, even though the author doesn't really go into why and how this clock is such so superior to others (ie the engineering), then this book is for you 
 Item worked for 1 minute before breaking.  Very difficult to get the correct grind.  Definitely an item to keep away from.  Am returning as defective 
 There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked this book up on the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there 
 4 of "their songs" are covers of S Club 8 & S Club 7 songs, suprising that SC7 & SC8 are all from the same company!! 
 Except for the chapters on raster algorithms, this book is just an extended bibliography. It has no material on texturing, for example, just a reference to the original paper on it. The math isn't that mature either, and the chapter on Perspective Projections is a pedagogical atrocity. Instead of buying this book, just go to your local univ. library and xerox the bibliography; then, lookup the articles on topics you're interested in 
 We purchased the Giant Art Jar Kit and found that the jar is mostly filled with colorful paper confetti, so that it looks like you recieved a lot of craft items. When you open it, and rifle through, you will find that the actual craft items only require the bottom quarter of the jar. We were disappointed 
 These are old Disney shows from 2 series.  I saw then on the late-night "Vault Disney" series.  They were well done and interesting.  The only problem is that this DVD is only a few (6 total) of the 18 shows.  So although I would rate the shows as a 4 or 5, this release gets 1 star for being incomplete.  Save your money for if and when the whole series comes out 
 one word: outdated.  two words: super outdated.  three words: super outdated awkwardness.  not 'from electronica's best days'!!!  god help us if that were the case.  its from POP electronic music's EARLY days.  a listen now proves it goofy and cheezy.  electronic music has improved about 5000% since this cd came out.  and so did the orb.  the orb is great!  yes!  orb!  great!  but do not buy this cd unless A) you were into it when it came out originally (in which case you would not be reading this), or B)you are soooo obsessed with the orb you have to listen to everything they/he has done... if you are curious about the orb, buy their new cd... 
 Although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust. This made me look awkward and did not fit well. Don't waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as I did. 
 Mr. Lane attempts to tackle a serious issue of great importance to modern capitalist democracies.  Certainly after long days we all wonder if the drudgery of capitalist lifestyles is worth the rewards.  However, the book suffers from many analytical flaws.  It attempts to find casual mechanisms resulting in unhappiness, but fails to adequately untangle the many sources of unhappiness and several times places emphasis on clearly the wrong one. The book is also extremely redundant, and could have been condensed to half its size.  Lastly, many of the studies cited needed more justification and explanation. The results of the studies certainly are an adequate factual foundation to justify the facade he attempts to build.  It certainly is a beginning to a discourse on a serious question, but this book does not have the answers 
 This is just another neophyte book targeted for gullible teen buyers by Llewellyn. When will they publish a decent book on witchcraft instead of the trendy "wicca movement" made popular by the television series "Charmed"? It sells books and that's what Llewellyn is about. Thus, my guess is never. Look at some books by Weiser and Falcon Publications for some less trendy and serious books on witchcraft and ceremonial magic.  
 Ok, so it's boring as hell, pointless, with no plot and about characters who are not even remotely interesting. Then how come this film is actually good? Because you feel obliged to think so. Antonioni is a big name, you know.   
 As someone who studied meta-mathematics at Caltech and UCLA, I found this book disappointing-stylistically, mathematically and philosophically. To paraphrase the physicist Pauli, this isn't right; this isn't even wrong. This well-meaning man's editors should do a little bit of legwork before reprinting a man's inflated self-appraisal. I am so disappointed in this book that I am seriously considering returning it for a refund.   I guess I should blame myself. My first response to the editorial comment naming the author as the intellectual heir to Gdel and Turing was, "Gregory who?" Shelah, Solovay, Martin: these are names I know, but who is Gregory Chaitin? I should have gone with my gut. In retrospect, it is telling that all the jacket quotes are from freewheeling authors of popularizations, not from respected philosophers, logicians, or scientists.  The entire book is written in an embarrassingly gushing, adolescent style full of boldface and exclamation points. I know that the author was trying to write an enthusiastic, accessible book of philosophical and methodological advocacy, but this doesn't excuse shoddy editorial craftsmanship.   Don't take my word for it. Let the author speak for himself. From page 7, "Gdel's 1931 work on incompleteness, Turing's 1936 work on uncomputability, and my own work on the role of information, randomness and complexity have shown increasingly emphatically that the role that Hilbert envisioned for formalism in mathematics is best served by computer programming languages[.]"   Imagine if a working composer wrote, "Bach's preludes and fugues, Beethoven's symphonies, and my own string quartets have shown increasingly emphatically..." This man's reputation in his declared field is nowhere near his apparent stature in his own mind. The ideas discussed in this book are worthy of late-night musings over a nice brandy, or maybe a Scientific American article, but only after extensive revision. They are not ready for publication in a monograph.  From pages 148-149, "This book is full of amazing case studies of new, unexpected math ideas that reduced the complicated to the obvious. And I've come up with a few of these ideas myself. How does it feel to do that? [...] You have to be seized by a demon, and our society doesn't want too many people to be like that! [...] In fact, I only really feel alive when I'm working on a new idea, when I'm making love to a woman (which is also working on a new idea, the child we might conceive) or when I'm going up a mountain! It's intense, very intense. [...] I push everything else away. [...] I don't pay the bills. [...] And you can't force yourself to do it, any more than a man can force himself to make love to a woman he doesn't want. [...] People may think that something's wrong with me, but I'm okay, I'm more than okay."  And there you have it. I was hoping for a book to catch me up on some of the recent advances in meta-mathematics and how these ideas bear on science and philosophy. For a far better viewpoint on how information science influences modern physics, check out Charles Seife, Decoding the Universe. 
 anyone buying music by this no-talent hack MUST be deaf!!!! 
 This is an awesome awesome movie. I say that because it is one of the best renditions Hollywood has ever done of a person suffering from "psychotic depression." Johnny Depp (who is effected by it) lets the viewer watch this illness evolve in a slow journey down into the dark pit of insanity. The audience experiences this pure psychosis in a fashion that is authentic to the T.  The movie ingeniously shows this form of stress-induced-insanity which is so brilliantly triggered by (1) finding your wife in bed with her boyfriend, (2) the impending divorce, (3) Depp having to move out of his house and into a summer house on a lake, and (4) the inevitable financial stress on this lead character. I mean, oh my god, he must be running about 500 stress points! That's enough to trigger a psychotic attack on anyone who is predisposed to psychotic mental illness (paranoid schizophrenia, psychotic bipolar, psychotic depression, post-partum psychosis - about 8 million US people).  This is exactly the type of stress that triggered me to go into an almost identical type of psychotic episode a number of years ago while an army officer assigned to Germany. For me, the stressors were very similar to the movie - move to Europe, new platoon leader, financial difficulties, relationship stress, new language to speak, etc.  Psychosis means delusions and the movie very realistically showed the onset of the "persecutorial delusion" (where you think someone is coming to get you) by showing Turturro coming to get Johnny. And then the formation of the potentially more serious "grandiose delusion" where you think that others (real people) are conspiring against you. This is where some psychotic people will actually lash out at others, and by so doing, if they harm them, they become criminally insane. Of the 8 million of us who have this type of psychotic illness, about 50,000 of us will do this. We'll read about the next one in the newspapers next week. Almost all of these will be done by people who did not know they had a psychotic illness, were not previously diagnosed and were not medicated. And this is exactly Depp's situation in the film (I have psychotic bipolar and must take lithium for mania, and Zyprexa for psychosis daily).  Psychosis also means hallucinations. And Turturro has this part by playing an "imaginary paranoid hallucination antagonist." This is really an ingenious Hollywood technique because it helps others in our society understand psychosis by showing a visual hallucination. I believe the technique was first used in "Beautiful Mind." This phenomenon, coupled with the delusions, is what makes paranoid psychosis a horrifying experience.  The movie shows this paranoid delusional psychosis very well and Depp actually lashes out at a number of people in his psychotic episode. For me, I got these same types of delusions and similar hallucinations in Germany but never lashed out at others - therefore I got an honorable discharge as a captain, after getting out of the stressful situation and the psychosis dissipated.  I liked the above parts of the movie very well for its authenticity - it was good. However what I didn't like about the movie is that it went way over board in the number of homicides. This just adds to the mental illness stereotype and the stigma. And so more people won't go in and get help when they should be getting help and medication. It took me 23 years before I got help. Why? Because of the stigma and fear. Maybe if society didn't have this stigma, we wouldn't have these types of terrible tragedies like in this movie. My heart goes out to anyone who has been impacted by this.  Society has available the medicine and counseling which is needed to eliminate this type of tragedy. Maybe if they educated the masses in a smart way we could eliminate it. But instead we "monsterize" this illness by this type of movie 
 I was under the impression that this was the entire series. I finally, after many issues, got my set and unwrapped it, and my heart sank audibly when I saw "Complete Collection I". I popped the last disk in and lo and behold, it wasn't the full series afterall. 
 This book is pretty near worthless. I started reading it knowing that I was unlikely to agree with much of Vicki's "advice," but I thought it still might be funny. It wasn't. Also, lots of her advice is not only wrong it is *completely* wrong--as in, not only not backed up by evidence, but actually *contraindicated* by evidence. I could not even finish reading the book after I got to the complete drivel that was her "advice" on infant feeding--she presented the section as "common considerations when deciding to breastfeed" and then proceeded to describe the absolute worst-case-scenario for everything possibly related to breastfeeding (& several things that can't be blamed on breastfeeding at all!). It was a common considerations section, but would have been more aptly named, "reasons I think breastfeeding is awful and no one should do it" section.   I think it is valuable for women to read books that present a less-than-rosy view of motherhood, because too often we have a strong and persistent "perfect mother" image in our heads that is very difficult to live up to (especially if we have perfectionistic tendencies). I adore real-life, tell-it-like it is motherhood memoirs--they are validating and supportive. This book, however, is overwhelming negative and baby-bashing. There are much, much better books out there that do not worship motherhood, but do not completely despise it either 
 An awful lot of advice....but nothing exacting. Don't think you are going to read this and be able to cure yourself. A lot of medical info is wishy-washy and often contradicted from one chapter to the next. With the  level of chinese medicine he is recommending...you still need a  professional 
 Hi points - Interesting, readable, good suggestions and examples on how to transition from a "9 to 5" job to independent photographer.  Low points - Over emphasis on film aspects (non-digital) of running a business (setting up a dark room and lab...), computer section so basic it's almost humorous, no review of digital tools such as PhotoShop or Paint Shop Pro.  The general information is good for those in the dreaming stage. I suggest you find it at your local library, (sorry Amazon) because it's not something you'll go back to over and over. Mr. Oberrecht's detailed use of a paper document and bookeeping system is excruciating. It seems he views computers as a necessary evil instead of the powerfull tool they can be.  As someone who is seriously considering making this move, I was disappointed 
 Shimon Tzabar have based his theory on a few observations. Like what he called a 'retreat'. That 'retreat' could be seen by others as a from of maneuver warfare, assymatric warfare or hit-and-run.  Being a loser may sometimes have positive sides, but not always!!! If you look further in history. There lots more of examples where the loser was wiped out or became slaves 
 The first two reviewers did a great job of describing the storyline, so I won't go there.  I'll tackle the ending...WHAT ENDING?  I even backed it up to see what I missed. THEN, I went to the special features to see an alternate ending.  It varied little from the shows ending. After investing the time to see this movie, I hated the ending. However, Jacqueline Bisset is still very lovely. Adam Garcia didn't too badly and I did like the sounndtrack so there were a few saving graces... 
 This is the type of movie that has me shaking my head and wondering why time, effort and money are invested in such projects while much worthier cinema ideas are left to die 'a'borning'.  Roger Ebert gave this movie three and a half out of four stars.  Although a fan of Ebert's movie reviews in general, I will say that his review of this movie is a good example of why it may be said of his reviews, "When they are good they are very, very good.  But when they are bad they're just terrible."  The child lead, Blake Heron is not accomplished enough for casting in anything more ambitious or sophisticated than a school play and the adults who attempt to support him is this travesty of an attempt at a rite of passage film must have been hanging their heads in embarrassment between takes.  Even the old veteran of such notable efforts as "In the Heat of the Night" and "The Pawnbroker", Rod Steiger is cast as a supportive adult trying to help the young boy (Heron) gain the insight and commitment required to get an abused Beagle pup he has become attached to away from an "old boy" trapper/poacher.  Perhaps Ebert felt some obligation to pay tribute (with a positive review) to any film in which a minor luminary like Steiger might appear but I can't help feeling that his primary responsibility should to the movie going, purchasing and renting public that reads his reviews looking for guidance in making decisions about investing their time and money.   Be advised: this is a stinker and a waste of your time 
 I picked this book up because it was on a book club's book list.  I actually had to go through InterLibrary Loan to get it since it wasn't available at my library.  After reading and forcing myself to finish it, I envision the head librarian at my branch shredding all copies to line hen cages, which would explain why a book club item wasn't available in a library.  Or perhaps the book club people had gone temporarily mad, who can say.  Many other reviewers have commented on the one-dimensional characters, the wooden pace, the absence of any attempt to sketch character motivation, but no one has mentioned the idiotic prose that flows, page after page, endless as the wine in Salim's cup.  "He looked down, and there was something sticking out from his belly.  It was a sword," is a paraphrased example of what you might find in this book, or with equal probability and more purpose, on an SNL skit.  This is a badly written book, if you had no interest in Mughal history, you will not have any interest in it after reading this book.  If you thought that was a wonderful period rich in complexity, you'd shred this book and line the hen cages too 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 I was very interested in buying this product even before it came out, but I have to say I am disappointed.  This product does not offer any thing that a digital watch timing your run, a play list that is constructed before you run and figuring our your miles before you run on the street and it is even less useful if you are going on a treadmill.  I say less useful on the treadmill because it keep track of the distance for you, and when running on the street its not that hard to chart out a running path for you before you go out and run.  This product is not the breakthrough that a lot of people think it is.   I am a fan of Apple products, have owned 4 Ipod, 2 Ibooks, an Imac and a MacMini but after buying this product I have decided to sell it because it doesn't do any thing that can do on your own.  I don't think that my mind would change if they added a heart monitor because you know that they up-charge for that probably into the 60-dollar range.   I have been running for the past 3 months on a daily basis, and have run 5K-10K and half marathons in the past.  
 This is one of my favorite romantic comedies.  It is funny, touching, and has some of my favorite actors in it.  And it doesn't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people! 
 I am going to admit this right off the bat: I don't own this book.  I did however almost buy it at Meijers when I saw it.  I thought it was going to be a great book.  You see, I denounced my Catholicism.  My mother has been encouraged to look into a bunch of faiths and try to find something more fitting to me.  So when I saw this book, I thought, "Great!  Now I can touch the basics of all religions."  And then I opened it up.  In the first few pages, there is a big disclaimer that reads "WE ASSUME THAT CHRISTIANITY IS THE ONE TRUE RELIGION BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY RELIGION WHERE GOD SAVES MAN AND MAN DOESN'T SAVE HIMSELF."  Now, I am not a theologian, but I do know this is a big lie.  As I flipped through the pages I realized that the book was incredibly biased.  The background for the Taliban/Islam section was patterned with machine guns, Universal Unitarian is listed as a cult, and it even lists NECROMANCY--a "religion" I've only heard about in video games.  The book immediately lost any credit I gave it when I read the back.  Do not buy this book if you are looking for an equal explanation of all theologies.  If you aren't, then why are you even bothering to buy the book 
 Sheer new age nonsense. Don't waste your time. I could pull quotes out of it all day long that would make you laugh out loud, and I'm talking about quotes where Jackson is dead serious. If he is what passes for an intellectual in the NBA, then the NBA is in trouble 
 This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of "Oprah Book Club" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak.   
 If you are expecting great insight into the lives of National Geographic's photographers or even revelations about what makes great photography then look elsewhere. This video greatly disappointed me as it is nothing more than promotional drivel. So fawning and servile is the narration that each sentence sounds as if it is about to collapse under the weight of the compliments for the organization. It reminds me of these terrible "the making of..." TV programs the have now to promote movies. It should be given free with subscriptions and not charged for. It is short and shallow and holds about 15 minutes in total interest for any photographer. Buy the magazine or one of their books instead. 
 Wendy Slatkin has produced an introduction to a subject which deserves a more indepth study. She offers a outline of women artists and their work that is, however, suitable for a beginning class of Art History students. It crys out for a broader scope and more detailed research, particularily in the area of 20th Century artists. It is, in this sense, an inspirational 'textbook' 
 If you're looking for balanced, cool-headed, well-argued case against Social Security reform, this is not your book. If you want a partisan diatribe that is about as worthwhile as the anti-Social Security "propaganda" that Mr. Skidmore describes, then you've found your  tome. (Curiously, in the author's narrative "propaganda" suddenly  becomes skillful or ingenious "rhetoric" when its used in support  of Social Security; never mind that the program has functioned like a  multi-billion dollar campaign fund for the Democrats). This book is  essentially an elaborate ad hominem attack against anybody who would dare  question the sustainability of current entitlement spending on the elderly.  The author attributes all reform proposals to the right-wing; never mind  that several respectable individuals whom no one would call reactionary,  including Brookings economist Henry Aaron, former CBO director Robert  Reischauer, former SSA chief actuary Robert Myers, and Urban Institute  senior fellow Eugene Steuerle have also suggested reasonable,  non-privatization proposals to slow the rate of entitlement spending.  Skidmore's arguments against any reform are poorly constructed and rely on  a very narrow range of evidence and expertise. He offers straw man  refutations such as a cranky letter from an Auburn professor in USA Today,  of all places, that is hardly representative of mainstream thought. There  are truly bizarre counterarguments: he suggests that projections of  increasing life expectancy must be bunk because the human race is not  immortal. There are downright falsehoods: he claims that the  "relevant" number concerning welfare state spending is the total  dependent population--ignoring the fact that the average elderly dependent  costs far more money than the average child dependent, and that money spent  on the latter is an investment in a future worker while supporting the  former only contributes to consumption. The author is also either  completely ignorant or disingenuous when he discusses the program's  financing. Like many of those who claim a "crisis" in the system,  Skidmore misleadingly focuses on the program's long-term "trust  fund" balance. Even if the economy will do far better than is  projected, as he argues, Social Security will eventually not be able to  support itself on payroll taxes alone and it will have to redeem its  "assets"--translated, this means that general taxpayer revenue  will be necessary to subsidize benefits, increasing what current workers  are paying into the system. He is correct to state that the increase in  Social Security spending will be only 1-2% of GDP, but Medicare will add  much more to that and the real concern is entitlement spending as a  percentage of the federal budget. There is legitimate concern that general  revenue transfers to entitlements plus interest expenses will crowd out  funds for everything else--from education to infrastructure to defense to  programs for the non-elderly poor. Skidmore makes the downright silly  argument that we should just hike up the interest rates on the bonds that  Social Security holds--where the hell does he think this money is coming  from? As the late Herb Stein mused, we could simply "credit"  Social Security with the money to pay benefits for the next trillion years  if we wanted to, but this would simply be an accounting gimmick. Yet this  is what Skidmore endorses when he enthuses over Clinton's "plan"  to "save" Social Security by shifting debt even further down the  timeline. Predictably, Skidmore says that if trouble should arise, we  should simply raise taxes (in his eyes, raising the retirement age is a  dastardly benefit cut). In his glorified history of the program, Skidmore  doesn't bother to mention how Democratic Congresses routinely ignored  scheduled payroll tax increases and instead continued to hike up  benefits--thereby increasing the level of payments that are considered  necessary. Research, such as that done by Daniel Radner (1993) and Michael  Hurd (1989) show that the elderly are at least as well off as the rest of  the population, even though the elderly poor generally have no means to  escape their poverty. Yet Skidmore dismisses the idea of targeting relief  to this group, instead relying on the liberal shibboleth that attributes  Social Security's political success to its "incorporation" of the  middle class, which is really just a roundabout way of saying that people  tend to like the government when the government sends them checks. (He also  conveniently fails to discuss that the program's political support revolves  around a few carefully promoted fictions--see the Rothstein article in  reference below). Social Security and Medicare have been successful in  helping lots of people, there's no doubt about that. But we should not  ignore the fact that the program was created in different time for a  different world, and has grown into something far larger than what was  originally contemplated. Longer life spans, less working years, greater  health--these are all things to be happy about, but they also signify a new  reality that books like this one will not help us to understand. Far better  books on the subject include Aaron & Reischauer's Countdown to Reform,  or Steuerle's Retooling Social Security for the 21st Century. Even if  you're skeptical of privatization, as I am, see the work of Martin  Feldstein or William Beach of the Heritage Foundation (Beach's plan DOES  account for disability, and he has answered critics of his methodology). I  found this book repeatedly frustrating, even maddening at times, for the  author's intransigence and even dishonesty on several issues--a for more  earnest discussion of the liberal standpoint is Richard Rothstein's  "When We Practice to Deceive" in Dissent (Fall 99). In sum, this book is alternately dim-witted,  disingenuous, omissive, and petty. It's hard to believe that a supposedly  reputable academic could put out such an unillimunating piece of tripe like  this. This is one of the worst books on public policy that I have ever  read 
 Having been asked by a European friend for a book recommendation to learn the nuts and bolts of American history, I gave this book a pre-read with the idea that it might be a fun way for her to learn the basics.  Unfortunately, I found this book to be highly subjective and slanted toward the left.  It's a shame because the author is effective in presenting this historical overview in a light, fun manner.  If only his ideology hadn't interfered.. 
 this book is just another sex and cheap ones. I guaranteed you not to flip through this book more than once. Don't bother.  
 The "Great Jobs..." series (offerings range from accounting to theatre) all suffer from a rather fundamental flaw:  None of their authors posses the skills of which they're purporting to be qualified to give advice on.   Camenson knows nothing about economics. If someone is writing career books  for a living, chances are that they are among the worst people to be  getting career advice from (unless you want to write career books). What's  worse, the vast bulk of this book does not even pertain to economics.   Instead it offers examples of sloppy cover letters and "methods of self  assessment" that have been simply rehashed from the other books of this  series.  In essence, there is only one book in the "Great Jobs..."  series; it has just been fitted with a different cover for each  undergraduate major in hopes to appeal to the broadest audience.  Great  idea - Bad book 
 I had my twins at 35 after fertility treatments and still had a difficult time relating to the woman in this book. Not because I like things sugar-coated or pretend that motherhood is always a bed of roses. But for a far better written realistic account of how tough new babies can be on your psyche,read Anne Lamott's Operating Insructions. Judith Newman had a charmed life, with the full time nanny and never bothering to breastfeed even one week,even though the babies were preemies and one had very serious weight gain issues for months.There are some funny lines, but mostly I just found myself disgusted with her and being happy i checked it out from the library instead of buying it 
 the book literally goes step by step for even the most simple task. It takes too long to learn even the most basic thing. Furthermore, the book is very procedure oriented. In other words, you learn to accomplish a very specific task without learning how to handle your own need 
 I wanted to really like this book--it had a great sounding premise, that's why I bought it without checking with other book readers first. I had to force myself to read until the end. I found the way the characters went from one reality to the next to be unbelievable. Also, I didn't get to know and care about the characters. 
 "Wise Blood" could more aptly be called "Stupid Minds."  Both titles are tendentious, but the latter is more accurate.  Ms. O'Connor depicts a pair of Southern troglodytes in the grip of religious mania.  We are meant to regard their fanaticism as a form of primal wisdom; in fact, it is merely ludicrous or pathetic.  Those who deem this judgment parochial should ask themselves whether Ms. O'Connor, an Orthodox Roman Catholic, was any less so.   Faulkner plumbed the humanity within or beneath the grotesque.  Ms. O'Connor is more interested in the God-driven grotesqueness that warps humanity; she sees it as higher knowledge.  Her prose in this early effort is merely workmanlike, and time has made what was strange or shocking in her vision seem familiar.  If blood wisdom were truly wisdom, an Islamic terrorist would be wise 
 This movie is lame, corny, predictable, weak on a plot, and altogether just bad.  Sure it was funny in small spurts,  but it just didnt deliver the complete package.  I think Larry is a funny guy,  but sadly Larry is the only good thing about this movie.  gets 1 extra star for being mildly funny. 
 Sorry, but I only like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chen. Who is gonna even try to look for some third actor movies? Jet Li is the third star, but Bruce is the best, he is my brother and all.. 
 Expecting more detail and less fluff, this commentary left me very disappointed. Metzger again gives his subjective opinion over mainstream scholarly work on extant Greek manuscripts. Of particular, his wholly unresearched and subjectiveness reached a pinnacle when writing about the ending according to the Gospel of Mark. In step with the denominational world, his denial of the last 12 verses of Mark coincide with his denial that baptism saves. Also, throughout the almost 700 small (physically, and contextually small) pages there is nothing but a smattering of "this text gives that while this other text omits the other..." - give us a break! Metzger, in order to sell his name, sacrifices integrity for the pound ($). This book is profoundly uninteresting and does nothing to add to the scholarly research already out there today 
 I have a moderate interest in philosophy, and watched that recent show on PBS called Consolations of Philosophy, with some interest.  Based on de Botton's interpretation of Seneca, I bought this book.  I found it absolutely unreadable and boring.  Furthermore, it does NOT contain De Irae/On Anger.  I can't imagine anyone benefiting from reading this book, or enjoying it 
 From my perspective this is a quite average book. You find some interesting charts and amazing facts. But in fact the book is riding the commodity investment theme. Apart from this there is little discussion which companies will profit from a rising Asia.. 
 I was going to give this book 2 stars, but then I thought, Why be nice?  It was recommended to me by someone's mother and I guess I should have expected the worse from the start.  It's conventional stuff.  So I din't mean to criticize one's taste if that's what you're into.  Just be warned that it doesn't take risks and doesn't lift your spirits or mind or anything of that good stuff 
 Barbara Victor's work as a journalist has taken her through the Middle East since the early Eighties. The backdrop of her experiences there forms the seed of this book (sensationally titled Les Femmes Kamikazes in its European printing). Victor also directed an accompanying documentary film-also called Les Femmes Kamikazes-that parallels her book. The bases of her research are interviews conducted with the families of four shahidas, the Arabic word for female suicide bombers. She also interviews a host of Israeli "terrorism experts", (a problematic tactic, as their expertise exclusively supports Zionist ideology) as well as journalists, members of the Israeli secret police and psychologists on both sides of the Green Line. Prefaced with a foreword by Christopher Dickey, Newsweek's Paris bureau chief and Middle East editor, the 20 short chapters of her book tell the stories of the shahidas, and other women who have taken an active role in the uprising.  A novelist and non-fiction author, Barbara Victor has made women her topic in the past, with subjects as diverse as Madonna and Hanan Asrawi. It is hard not see that the extremes represented by those subjects haunt this work-perhaps not the benefit of her argument. For example Victor's preoccupation with the physical appearance of her subjects has an odd relationship with the feminist principles that her book purports to espouse. Wafa Idris, the first female Palestinian suicide bomber in history is described as having "perfect makeup" and "beautifully manicured nails" to match the "smart, western-style coat" she wore on her final trip to the mall.  Victor reports that, according to the sales clerk who survived the blast, Idris was trying to free her knapsack from the doorway of a store while watching herself reapply makeup in a compact when it suddenly exploded. Darine Aisha, the second shahida in history is described as having had "a captivating smile" while Ayat Al-Akhras-the third-wore makeup and "smart, western clothes." Victor uses the language of western fashion and style to suggest something of the interior lives of the women she profiles, a rhetorically dubious and politically retrograde tactic. There may indeed be something worth exploring in the ways these women choose to present themselves but Victor isn't interested in the larger implications of these choices. For example "Zina" (a pseudonym) wore a halter-top and tight pants to aid a male suicide bomber in completing his mission and initially eluded capture by miming an exaggerated cell phone conversation to convince patrolling Israeli soldiers she was an American tourist. This suggests that rather than an unconscious longing for western freedoms represented by makeup and clothing that Palestinian women are acutely aware of the way that western styles render them invisible, often as a precursor to the final disappearance of their martyrdom.  Victor refuses to acknowledge the political agency of their choices, portraying the shahidas instead as young women with "personal problems" who were exploited by male relatives into sacrificing themselves. Victor cites the now-familiar boogeyman of fundamentalist Islam as the prime motivator in this phenomenon. Ironically this narrative often runs counter to the testimony that she collects from the surviving families and friends of the martyred women. Wafa Idris' mother, Mabrook contends that her daughter was motivated "more by nationalistic fervor than religion." Indeed Idris was known for having an "independent mind and a profound feeling of resentment toward the occupation." In another example, Darine Aisha, a "brilliant" student of English literature at Al-Najah University, became a shahida after being sexually humiliated by Israeli border guards. The guards taunted her, tore off her headscarf and forced her to kiss and embrace her male cousin in front of a crowd of Palestinians waiting to cross into Israel. She tried to defend herself but acquiesced so that the guards would allow a nearby woman with a dying infant in need of medical attention to pass. A deeply religious woman she was also, according to her friends "a feminist in the true sense of the word", once having won an essay contest by writing "I am a Muslim woman who believes her body belongs to her alone, which means how I look should not play a role in who I am or what response I evoke from people who meet me. Wearing the hijab gives me freedom, because my physical appearance is not an issue." This statement shouldn't be interpreted as a universal defense of the veil but rather proof that the woman who wore it knew what she was doing with her life...and her death.  Victor positions the testimony of the Palestinians who knew the shahidas against the assertions of Israeli "experts" who consistently blame "fanatical" religious practices and the second class status of women in Palestinian society for their actions as opposed to the host of issues raised by living under Israeli occupation. For example, Mira Tzoreff, an Israeli academic says "(Palestinians) are living in a not very democratic surrounding...This is a reactive national culture, a collective atmosphere. We are talking about post-modern versus nationalistic, and that makes all the difference. People cannot stand alone or think for themselves...they must have a national explanation, and that is to see Israel and the United States as the ultimate enemy...." Statements like this one reveal the Orientalist character that mars Army of Roses as a work of serious scholarship, although it provides a revealing (if unintended) view of the misapprehensions underlying this conflict. The Israeli academic describes the Intifada as the longing for a "national explanation," while the Palestinians themselves describe it as the longing for a nation.  Again and again throughout her book the Palestinians point to the Israeli occupation as the main motivator in the phenomenon of suicide bombing (by either sex) and Victor continually returns to her original thesis: that Palestinian society uses fundamentalist Islam to shame troubled girls into killing themselves. In her introduction Victor recalls touring the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in Beirut in 1982 after the Lebanese Christian Militia and Israeli army massacred thousands of Palestinian occupants. She encountered a woman there who was the sole survivor of her family. The woman answered her questions "in surprisingly good English" telling her "You American women talk constantly of equality. Well, you can take a lesson from us Palestinian women. We die in equal numbers to the men." Perhaps if she had heard her differently Barbara Victor would have written another sort of book.  
 Mandelbrot has been pushing his fractals longer than most of us have been around. They might well describe the markets better than the CAPM but do they predict better is the key question? William Sharpe, who "invented" the CAPM, makes this very point on his home page. The CAPM captures risk and return, albeit imperfectly but what does Mandelbrot capture? Certainly not an audience as his theories will remain tangential until they have practical use. He wil always be at the frontier until his theory has a practical application, something for good and bad the CAPM has. The normal curve, is, with the lognormal distribution, the entry point to the world of heavy tails and quirkier distribtions and these are all used in markets world wide every day of the week; even the CAPM is widely used in corporate risk assessment. Ditto the imperfect Black Scholes model which allows us to predict, accurately enough for our purposes, the price of a European call, and thence a put etc etc. Although improvements have been have been made, it is like mother nature: unless the improvements give us better predictability, they are probably not worth the effort. Because the BS model gave us that predictability, it is widely used. Until Mandelbrot can do the same, his work will remain tangential at best, irrelevant at worst.   
 Unfortunately, I was unable to get past the first chapter because I was so disgusted and angered by the intensely obscene violent reference toward the very first female character introduced in the book.  This reference was highly INNAPROPRIATE for the intended age group: smashing her baby on the rocks so he could rape the mother holding the child.  Gratuitous and completely unnecessary.  Makes me wonder about the author, although his credentials look good on paper! Disgusting.  Will never take the chance with him again and will certainly not allow my boys to read his work 
 I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to create great music using Reason 3.0, which is an amazing piece of software. I feel as if I could spend a lifetime experimenting with its different virtual sound modules, effects, and drum machines. Unfortunately, I thought this book was too dry, and more focused on various "nuts and bolts" of the software, instead of the artistry a composer can explore. I actually preferred the Lyford book, which performs a great walkthrough on building a song from scratch. This book also has a walk-through on building a song, but I didn't enjoy going through it as much 
 In "Government Gay" (1997), the first book in Fred Hunter's Alex Reynolds mystery series, Alex's lover Peter is kidnapped.  In Chapter 15 of that novel, Alex finally rescues Peter from a locked hotel room by using his VISA card to pop the lock on a door off which the numbers had fallen, leaving only the shadows of said numbers on the grimy door.  Alex explains to his readers that he had learned this simple break-in technique from a neighbor.  In Chapter 12 of "National Nancys" (2000), the fourth book in the series, Alex is again trying to break into a hotel room, this time using bobby pins, when Peter suggests, "Why don't you try a credit card?"  Alex looks up at him, and says, "What?"  And Peter then proceeds to explain to Alex how the technique works.  Alex whips out his VISA card, but is unable to make the "new" trick work, leaving Peter to demonstrate how to pop the lock successfully.  Uh ... hello!  Wake up, Mr. Author!  Oh!  And did I mention that in this novel - too - the room number is able to be identified only because there were shadows left on the dirty door where the numbers used to hang?  It's this kind of sloppy, repetitive, and extremely formulaic writing that makes the Alex Reynolds series so incredibly tired.  Apparently author Hunter was so disinterested in the books that he didn't bother to worry about repeating himself after only four plots!  And sure enough, there is little about "National Nancys" to distinguish it from its previous three cookie-cutter predecessors.  Insist on trying out this series?  Pick one title, any title, and borrow it from the library.  Now you know exactly what happens in each of the first four novels! Alex, Peter, and Alex's mom get involved with murder; withhold evidence from the authorities; are warned by those same authorities to stop investigating; ignore the advice; barely escape death; wrap up the case.  Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z .. 
 I was tempted to be stupid and buy an updated version of one of his books. The older bigger one I had ordered from a Home Shopping network about 6years ago. From the reviews I see it's the same story. The phone numbers are out of service or have new people answering them for different places. You know you always want to believe help is possible. Unfortunately it isn't though from him as he's only helping himself to your money 
 This is another book by Borg that I would never purchase on my own.  Borg is a proud member of the Jesus Movement and it appears that their main goal is to discredit the Jesus of the Bible and remake Him in the mold of one of many spiritual people throughout history 
 A book on AppleScript, written in 2004, that completely ignores topics "data sources" and "data representations" can hardly call itself a bible.  The problem with such books, that write from real-life experience, is just that. They miss the real-life experiences of the rest of us. This book asks use to shun the label that "it is just another book on AppleScript," but that is all it is. Even 800-plus pages of oversized print cannot justify the $60 price tag 
 Unfortunate but true - the author clearly has not read the Harry Potter books themselves.  The "writing" itself is painfully stilted and gives the strong impression that scant facts have been surrounded by stock "fantasy" adjectives and adverbs and then bluntly tacked onto a generic "bio" outline.  I'd heard that this wasn't a great bio but while waiting for the Half-Blood Prince I broke down and bought it anyhow thinking "Just how bad could it be?"  The answer is "very."  I urge you not to make the same mistake.  However many times you've read the books themselves you'd be much better off reading them again than reading this 
 I have liked other Hot Pockets, like the ham and cheese is not bad if you spread some mustard on them but I think they over spiced the Pizza Hot Pockets. They taste kind of strong and weird 
 I had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews. I used the razor as directed in the instruction manual. The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product 
 I was totaly disapointed with the ending in this series of books. I felt let down, and like I had waisted my time and money on the entire series 
 I am not sure if these Reviews are from 'Paid' people but  If you atteneded any of her seminars from Learning Annexe, you will find out that she is basically selling you $6,000 seminars using this book. I have been to one of her seminar and it is all confusing and it will sure confuse you.  BUT , if you pay $6,000 , you will know what Martha beck is saying.   I was conviced that this is 'NOT' what you expected from her book or seminars.   Keep away from this Stuff, there are lot of useful / helpful people / books on amazon. Her seminars are so confusing that after spending 3-4 hours , you will try to find out 'What I need to do ' ?.  You are paying for her 'Marketing Ideas' by buying this Book..   Keep Away ,  
 I thought the book was a bunch of bolagna. I didnt care for it at all and someone should burn it. The only reason i liked it was because it had a bunch of short stories and not just one big book with a bunch of chapters. It had a lot of truth in it which is the only good part of the book. The book was basically about kids that dont fit in and are outsiders. Who ever get's this bpok should throw it away or tearit and burn it into peices 
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 Used a Panasonic 2.4Ghz phones as the extension and it would not get a dial tone.  Plugged in a simple corded phone and it worked just fine.  So, beware, the operation of the unit is uncertain.  
 This book was quite boring. Within the first few pages (when Ruby describes her own birth) hints were dropped about the ultimate "big secret" of the book. By the time I'd read a quarter of the book, there were so many hints it wasn't a secret any more. By the time I got to the end, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything more to the story than that. None of the characters were particularly likeable, nor were they bad enough to hate.  The book was billed as "darkly funny and satirical" in one review. I saw no humor except for the brief slapstick physical mishaps at a wedding reception late in the book. On reflection, I gained nothing from reading this book, and got about a half-minute of laughter from that one scene. It truly was a waste of my limited reading time 
 I saw this in a bin at Wal-mart for 2.99 and decide to get it since was 2.99.  Well, I want my money back.  No wonder I only remembered two songs from them Carmel and What would you do.  I would say get the singles to Carmel and call it a day.  I never liked What Would You Do because it was contradicting...guy at bachelor party see friend who is a stripper and tries to give her advice.  Wait..hello..you are were enjoying this lady removing clothes until you realized who it was.  The rest of the CD is slow and boring.  Claudette Ortiz has a great voice. She sort of sounds like Beyonce in songs 12 and 14 or vice versa.  Save your time, energy, and money on this Cd and enjoy these when they are played on the radio.  
 This book provides a broad overview of some of the issues behind the Simplicity movement.  The author, Cecile Andrews set up a number of Simplicity study circles near her home in the Northwest.  This book reveals some of the factors that led her to become interested in Simplicity as well as her ideas of how Simplicity study circles might work.  Much of the beginning of the book provides justification for adopting Simplicity.  Andrews enumerates problems such as hyper-consumption, environmental degradation, and personal isolation.  She also explores possible actions we could take to solve these problems, such as consciously building community with other people and the earth, finding ways to express our spirituality, and restructuring our economic system to make it more environmentally and socially friendly. In the last part of the book, she describes the idea of Simplicity study circles, the benefits that might be gained from participating in one, and how a study circle should operate.  She also provides a 10-week study plan based on the earlier material in the book.  Although I agree with the ideas in this book, I found the book rather disappointing in content.  Much of the discussion is either so personal as to be hard to generalize, or else a superficial summary of other more substantial texts.  For example, Andrews frequently refers to findings of Juliet Schor; readers would have more material for discussion by reading Schor's works directly.  Some of Andrews' suggestions for addressing problems are rather inappropriate.  To draw attention to hyper-consumerism, she suggests surreptitiously clothes-pinning tags with messages like "You don't really need this, do you?" inside articles of clothing in shops.  While I'm all for trying to get people to become more aware of their needless purchases, I don't think messing with the property of individual store owners is an acceptable way to go about the mission.  Her suggestions for reforming our economic system would be great in an ideal state, but until we are run by a benevolent socialist dictator, I don't think they can realistically be put into action.  It would be better to focus our efforts on goals that are conceivably achievable.  Overall, while I found the topic of this book interesting, I think there are numerous other books on the topic of Simplicity that are better implemented, starting with Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin's "Your Money or Your Life".  It's hard to tell from this book if Andrews can take credit for originating Simplicity study groups such as those run by the Northwest Earth Institute.  If so, she certainly deserves credit for her efforts in that area, but I don't think there's enough substantial material in this volume to use as background reading for an effective study group by itself. 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 This product does what it claims.  I recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well.  The downside of the product is the size.  It does a good job if you have an hour or more (depending on the size of your pet) to spend using it.  They tout it's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more.  I wish I had invested in the bigger, more expensive FURminator.  I rate this product with two stars, only because it's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal.  It would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat 
 This "book" takes the least possible information that you could source and still call it a book.  In fact, the publisher has done the history of income tax a disservice by foisting this material on us.  Neil Boortz with his Flat Tax and Steve Forbes with his Fair Tax, for their diatribes, depend on the public staying uninformed about the matters that determine public policy.  Mr. Federer has not enlightened us at all.  He has taken two or three statements made by John Kennedy and tried to stretch it into a book.  Save yourself the time and read any financial history by Steele or Bernstein or the Wiley Investment Series and you'll learn more about income tax and other historical matters of interest.  This is about the only book I ever returned to Amazon 
 This book is used as a platform for the author to show off his celebrity friends and to promote his new line of make-ups.  Only the first few pages contain some hints on make-up.  The title is misleading and the book does not deliver on its promises 
 I found this book incredibly boring and redundant.  I am suprised that this book has survived 11 editions.  Thomas and Strickland don't you read the reviews? Not worth my money 
 When I read this kid's biography at the end of the book and discovered that he is HOME-SCHOOLED IN RURAL OKLAHOMA it made me laugh out loud... that sure explained a lot!  The more of the book you read, the more you realize this kid has obviously been isolated from the real world and "educated" to see from the perspective of a conservative extremist.  All he seems able to do is raise a litany of generic complaints that we've already heard from every other right-wing fundamentalist out there, and use extremely flawed logic to attribute all of America's woes to liberals.  His book completely lacks any kind of fresh original perspective you might expect from a young writer.  Worse, it lacks substance- he is unable to back up any of his claims with anything real!  For instance, when he bashes Planned Parenthood, he makes this vague claim that the organization "works hard to cover up the unintended results" (that is, pregnancies, I assume; his poor writing skills make it very unclear).  HUH?  A cover-up he's saying?  Um.. a cover-up of WHAT, exactly?  I'd sure like to hear more... it would be nice if he could provide some facts or examples to back up this essentially meaningless claim.  But nope, that's the end of his thoughts on that subject.  Um... okay.  He then goes on to say "many left-wing organizations would like people to forget what a family looks like; they don't like the picture of a mom and dad and a couple of kids."  End of paragraph.  What is he talking about?!  Is he saying Planned Parenthood is against the existence of four-person families?  LOL.  This level of critical thinking would have received around a "C" in my high school English class... so who actually published this garbage?!  His next paragraph is great: "Entertainment and left-wing organizations are continually breaking down the American family."  That was the entire paragraph.  (Uh... editor?)  The book moves on to the next section, and he starts chastising Americans for being lazy and uncaring; this takes up almost an entire page.  I'm still waiting for his tie-back as to how this is the fault of "entertainment and left-wing organizations" when it finally comes.  Here's his explanation!!: You see, a century ago, he says, young people were responsible and independent, but now, they aren't.  What was different back then?  The entertainment industry of course!  "In the 1800s rap music, video games, the Internet, movies, and all these influences were not even a speck in someone's imagination."  End of argument.  LOL!!!!!  This is akin to the Pastafarians (that crazy new internet-based "religion"... look it up if you don't know what I'm talking about) claiming that global warming is caused by the decline in the number of pirates in the world-- after all, as the number of pirates has steadily decreased over the last few centuries, the average yearly temperature has steadily risen (and the Pastafarians even have a graph to prove this!).  Ah, such beautiful logic.  Another paragraph from the book starts off saying that liberal groups are trying to "eradicate the reminders of God in public life."  The author then ends the paragraph: "special-interest groups, burrowing in the school of America, recruit, teach, and indoctrinate young Americans with ideas and thoughts that no rational person would desire."  Again... no elaboration whatsoever.  WHAT?  I mean, he could be trying to say that underground satanic cults are brainwashing good Christian schoolchildren for all I know.  If I were a right-winger I'd be pretty annoyed at this Kyle kid for making my side sound more wacked out than ever.  Well, it looks Kyle's parents need to rethink whether their little "home school" is really providing him with the best education (especially with regard to language arts).  And Kyle, please get out in the REAL world so you can form a perspective based on actual knowledge and not just the stuff dictated to you by your parents 
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 I didn't care for the way  that each chapter was written about the thoughts of each family member, except for the murderous son.  We never hear much from him. Enjoyed the beginning, then I kept skipping pages waiting to read about what really happened.  The family didn't seem bothered that their son had killed a girl, rather that he may go to jail.  The mother was the only one who showed some concern for the girl's parents.  The book could have gone into more detail about the trial, but most of the book was about the father's thoughts.  Don't recommend it.  When I saw Merryl Streep was in the movie version, I know the movie must be pretty slow moving, as are all of Merryl's movies.  
 My husband and I tried using this book and it's methods for almost a year with not even a hint at conception. The author's "frank" opinion about trying to conceive after 35 is negative and discouraging. I refused to believe that I was infertile but because I am over 35, it was very difficult to determine my fertile window using these methods. It caused undo stress and anxiety and my husband and I finally broke down and spent the money to purchase an OVwatch. We conceived the first time using the watch. I am not trying to plug them for any reason other than it works. We conceived twice using the watch after a year of frustration and depression. They are the most decent, supportive, positive customer service oriented company I have ever encountered. I found Terri Weshcler to be incredibly negative and judgemental of women trying to conceive at a later age-and the last thing you need is another seed of negativity when you're trying to conceive 
 Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.  There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.  The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.  The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.  In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex 
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 So how does she get the furniture in--drop it down from the ceiling area?    Not one picture illustrates how to arrange furniture around design features such as a fireplace in between two large picture windows, or glass doors that most newer houses have these days, or large walkthrough archways, just to name a few room challenges that many people have.  Also, most of the groupings did not seem to allow for comfortable passageways for people to get from one end of the room to the other--the rooms were overcrowded with furniture.  I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it. Not recommended 
 Hate-filled people attract or convince very few people. At least this book is up-front about its level of rhetoric 
 The claims made in this book sound great, until you look at the other side of the Laetrile (a.k.a. B17) story.     I just can't find a CREDIBLE source that endorses Laetrile. According to the book that's because the Feds are out to get 'em. All mainstream Oncologists (or any M.D. for that matter) are part of a vast conspiracy fueled by greed and thinly veiled homicidal tendencies. (I should add suicidal to the list since DOCTORS DIE FROM CANCER TOO.)      We all need something to believe in when life stops being wonderful and gets tough, scary and incredibly unfair. When your sick and the best treatments available bring only a marginal chance of survival (sometimes leaving you with missing parts) it's only natural to become desperate and scour every resource you've got for a better way.  THAT'S WHAT MAKES US THE PERFECT 'MARK' FOR CON-MEN/QUACKS!      If you're still curious go ahead and read the book, but don't stop there.  Look at all sides to every story when considering treatment options, it's not like you have to believe every point of view you're exposed to.   Go to the watchdog sites and look up Laetrile/B17. Checkout the wrap sheet of the individuals marketing this stuff, cross reference your search and look at what other miracles they market. Ask yourself...   ·	Do the articles and testimonials for these different products seem to be a form letter.  ·	How do they find the time to become experts in virtually every field of medical science and discover a cure for EVERY major disease known to man? ·	Are they really a doctor? Did the school they earned their diploma from have authority to grant doctoral degrees in that field? ·	What is the success rate and where are the reports to prove it? If there are no records, how could they be so stupid? (Our brightest minds have been toiling for decades and they have records of every tiny success and huge failure.) ·	There are dozens products for every bodily function known to man on the shelves of vitamin shops. They are there legally even though most are not proven or doubted by the mainstream medical community. Why is B17 allegedly singled out? ·	Keep in mind that alternative therapies that WORK (i.e. Acupuncture) ARE being more widely accepted everyday.   ·	Many Quacks claim that their cure has been widely used in some far off land for ages and everyone there agrees it's saved numerous lives. THE WEB IS WORLD WIDE! Check it out! Are Australians being cured without a doubt or has their government just not gotten around to banning the product yet?  Making an informed decision is a lot of work, but it's a worthy investment of time if it prevents you from trading your life for a lie.  
 Mr. Dennett's book demonstrates the ignorance, irrationality, and dishonesty  of humanists. Discussing the meaning of word materialsim, Professor Dennett says:  "In its scientific or philosophical sense, it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial--like a Cartesian soul, or "ectoplasm"--or God. The standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic, which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance, matter and ...whatever minds are supposedly made of." (p. 302)  Philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics. A modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence.   The philosophy that God does not exist is not materialism, it is naturalism. Materialism is the view that all that exists is matter. Materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena. (In a quote below, you will see that Dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in.)  It is not clear from the book whether Dennett is a materialist, but he is certainly a naturalist. Concerning the proof of God's existence, he trots out David Hume's "Who made God?" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality. I refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof.  Let's look at two quotes, the first is at the end of the chapter "Belief in Belief" and the other at the beginning of the chapter "Morality and Religion":   "That is, isn't it true that, whether or not God exists, religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy, in the rule of law, in free will? The very widespread (but far from universal) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning." (p. 245)  " Without the divine carrot and stick, goes this reasoning, people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires, beak their promises, cheat on their spouses, neglect their duties, and so on.  There are two well-known problems with this reasoning: (1) it doesn't seem to be true, which is good news, since (2) is is such a demeaning view of human nature." (p. 279)  In the first chapter, he mentions "bulwark of morality" and "meaning." But in the second chapter, he leaves out "meaning."  If our purpose in life is not to get to heaven, what is our purpose is life?   Whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief. Mr. Dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist Christians.  There are worse things than divorcing your spouse. Disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said. Mr. Dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life.  The only miracle mentioned in Mr. Dennett's book is the Shroud of Turin, which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man.  Since no one claims to know how the image got there, it can be called a miracle. However, Mr. Dennett does not tell us anything about it. The reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet. 
 These headphones have no bass whatsoever.  I would never buy these, please keep shopping as there are better products for the money out there.  The headphones that came with my MP3 player out of the box are WAY better then these 
 This has to be one of the worst books ever written!  This book was absolutely horrible.  It was so bad I found myself midway skim-speed reading just so I could finish this.  I have to admit the title, cover art, author, story line & rave reviews listed on the front and back covers drew me in.  Boy, what a mistake.  I have so many issues with this book that it will be hard to break them down.  But I will try:  1st:  Too wordy!! too many unnecessary details about things and people you could care less about!  This book would have been BETTER WITH HALF THE WORDS.  2nd:  Am I the only one that had issues with the names of these characters.  I found the names annoying and SILLY!!  "T.Terry Tiger" are you serious?  "LaShaWanda"  "Odell"  "DeQuan, DeJuan & whatever the other one is"  "Exultia" "Sequoia".  There were so many others I made myself forget.  The names of the organizations were laughable at best.  Actually the characters themselves were laughable at all times!  3rd:  The main characters seemed more like they had the perspective of a 50-something year woman than that of today's modern 40 year old.    4th:  Please tell me WHY and WHAT was the relevance of Acey being visited by her dead husband!!  This does not fit the storyline.  Its misplaced and weird.  Completely unnecessary.  5th:  Sexually liberated?  Forget it.  These women WERE hardly sexually liberated, sexually experimental maybe.  They had to incessantly maintain some type of sexual modesty or closed-minded view of others' sexuality at all times.  I am sure if you have the displeasure of reading this book you will see the contradictions.  Did they ever use condoms themselves?  6th:  Please help me to understand why when they found out they were $40,000 dollars short to qualify for a loan, they simply did not adjust their loan request amount?  Why is it when she found out her ex-husband STOLE THE MONEY FROM HERE ACCOUNT she didn't file criminal charges against him and or the bank for releasing this money without her permission.  No that would make too much sense, instead she decided to forgive him AND hire him as a cook in her spa after he used all the money up paying for spa & sex services from "A Sisters' Spa" and for of all things, a sex change!!  7th:  Who would ask their 70-year old mother to research information on brothels?  8th:  Why spend the majority of the book trying to get the spa instead of 3/4 of the book on the spa's goings on which would be far more interesting to readers than ghosts, preachers and jimmy choo boots.  9th:  Was that not the CORNIEST ENDING EVER???  What the hell? The sex worker gets the preachers wife pregnant after she comes to the spa "undercover" only to find out the preacher is his long lost FATHER.  RIGHT.  And then the duo go TO AFRICA and begin recruiting.  WOW. OK. I was so exasperated by the end that I wanted to throw the book in the garbage.  10th:  The sheer arrogance of the author to make you sift through her mental ramblings of her fairytale black/white male/female reality coupled with the blatant neglect and incompetency of the editor in not doing a better job curtailing and guiding this literary garbage to something ALMOST REALISTIC and REMOTELY ENJOYABLE is disgraceful.  Her approach was obviously like a journalist/reporter.  Jill get a new editor and stop having your friends write reviews on AMAZON for you!  If you insist on reading this book BORROW it, other wise you will regret spending ANY of your hard earned cash for it.  
 This book covers little ground. The author extends comic relief constantly, which gets extremely annoying. Many books on this subject are much better 
 I think all this stuff is from California. I could be wrong. But it's pretty jewish, anyway. Ooh, I'm so kult/dangerous/initiated.   Anyone who drops money on this book, any like it, or anything remotely associated with Feral House and its pet charlatans, is a bloody fool. People who liked this also bought: Marilyn Manson's last album. Should tell you something about the level of culture here, no? Such folks want the allure of "badness" like rats want crack. No substance, pure ego trip. 
 I cannot imagine why a publisher agreed to publish this book.  Of the purported 166 pages of text, from page 69 onwards are the text of three speeches to Congress.  Of the 60 pages before that, every second page is a poorly reproduced picture.  The result is that there is only 30 pages of actual material, and those are written in large font.    The book stats show that there are 5647 words in total in this book - maybe enough for a first year tax essay, but he would have failed on content.  There is nothing to learn from this waste of paper.  It should have been 15 pages long and given away as a pamphlet.  Save your money.  
 And that's good news, of course, if you like video games.    But if you want a movie--even an action/adventure movie--this one isn't worth watching even once.    Between all the relentless barages of one-second meaningless images, however, they do manage to sandwich in some of the ethical issues concerning cloning, and surprisingly they present some of the pros and well as some of the cons.  For this, I give the movie two stars.   
 George G.M. Jones knows not a thing about real history. Claiming that the Great Library of Alexandria is where Aristotle took his knowledge is ludacris because the library was built by Ptolemy II. The Ptolemic line was the successor line in Egypt. Alexander, himself was crowned pharaoh by the people because they saw him as a liberator of Egypt. The priests of Egypt viewed him as the son of Zeus. These priests were of the god Ammon who were told at his oracle. The Egyptian Mysterey System was a creation of white men and is a proven hoax. The first Greek philosophers most likely had some knowledge of Babylonian and Egyptian thought they added reasoning, something none existant in Egyptian or Babylonian thought. Even saying that ancient Egyptians were all black is wrong, as the people of Egyptian constituted a mixture of races. They were black and white. They were in fact Semites, like the Jews and Arabs, people who are Caucasian. Skin color alone does not tell a man's race. An Indian from India is in reality Caucasian, making him closer to Europeans than the Japanese or Chinese. Even most the languages of India and Iran are Indo-European, while the Basque live in France and Spain but speak a language isolate. If the Greeks stole anything from anyone it was the Phoneicians and their alphabet, something that is the ancestor to the Greek, Latin, Etruscan, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets. The name Kemet was a reference to the black soil of Egypt. Today it is called Misr anyways.  
 ive been 'a writer' in the loosest form of the word for omose twenty years now and on occassion i'll pick up some other people's poetry and see what's what... i was standin in a bookstore flippin thru mr. young's 'jellyroll' and instantly loved it! - i didnt buy it tho - i'm cheap and i'm thrifty and 'to repel ghost' seemed to be the better buy for my money (there's like abillion poems in this thang!)...  i started off pretty intrigued/fine and dandy... brotha young is hit and miss, but overall, he gives us a pretty good effort... (does his own personal background matter? i dont know... but it doesnt really make much difference to me. being raised 'well-off' doesnt prevent a person from experiencing hardship...)  ((umm, i get sidetracked pretty easily, so let me get back to my review/thank you!))  my biggest gripe with this book is proly more a reflection of my own patience than of mr. young's writing skills... quite frankly, I GOT TIRED OF READIN ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER... i found myself moanin & lamentin as i turned each page, hopin to not see either 'basquait' or 'warhol' in print EVER AGAIN... but it never quite played out that way... i do think that brotha young tried a lil too hard to capture basquait's 'essence'... i think i'da rather seen him write about his own interpretations of the artwork, rather than try to tell the painter's life thru biographical poetry...  this might have been a much better experience if it was only HALF its length... some of it reads well... other parts are more tedious... but im grown. i guess i coulda stopped whenever i wanted to...  but like i said, i'm cheap and i didnt wanna feel wasteful...   aint nothin worse than to trudge thru some poetry...  (...tho, many people have said the same thing about my own 'writings' ...the @#%&!#&-ers!!!)  ...anyway...  much of this is 3 to 5 star material. my overall rating of '2' is more my anti-basquait-angstisms coming into play.   
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 This was required reading for my 15 year old son and he said: It was boring 
 I agree with the above review; minimal information, absolutely horrible photos and rather crummy quality paper makes this book not worth buying.  Meadmore selected many chairs that are discussed much more completely in other similar books.  He missed a few key chairs of note; Saarinen's Grasshopper chair and Aalto's Armchair 400 (Zebra or tank) chair.  If you want a good welll rounded selection of Modern Chairs, I'd suggest the 1000 Chairs book instead 
 La Femme Nikita is still my favorite program of all time, with nothing coming close.   The music on the show worked to create an atmosphere that was eclectic.    But without the visuals of the characters in play, the songs are not compelling (with the noted exception of "Love Thieves").    If you love Nikita, but you're over 40, skip the CD 
 I really hoped this book would live up to its promising title.  Unfortunately it turned out to be not only "all over the place" in terms of its approach to the subject matter, but alternately banal and inexplicably eccentric in adducing historical example.  The author jumps heedlessly back and forth between the strategic and tactical levels of war as he considers the history of warfare (in the West), along with mass armies, railroads, sea power, and other of the usual topics.  Regrettably his organization of the material never acknowledges the role of the operational level of war in bridging strategy and tactical battle through campaigns; this oversight produces insights that are, to the military mind, humorously banal, such as the following:  "Offensive operations then get launched even where states had defensive intentions." (p.11)  One is tempted to respond, "Duh, Shraggy."  (Quester attributes this phenomenon not to the considerations of geography, tactics, weapons capabilities, politics, and alliances that normally go into such operational choices, but to what he calls the "offensive" character of technology.  Reducing the conscious human choices of offense and defense to automatic consequences of the technology of weapons is only one of the disservices done by Quester's tendency to extrapolate backward from his organizing model:  the unique constraints imposed by global thermonuclear weaponry during the Cold War.)  The questionable invocations of historical trends, causes, and effects are too numerous to catalogue.  Examples include the assertion that "the significance" of agriculture to warfare is the necessity it implies to defend territory; whereas it seems more significant to mankind's development that agriculture uniquely promotes creation of the wealth and societal stability that alone enable long-term conquest.  In another example, Quester overstates the influence of Clausewitz on Imperial Germany, suggesting that he "taught the Germans to be 'too total' " (in waging war) in the years prior to WWI.  This characterization of German strategic policy in the 19th century, a policy that exemplified "limited war" for subsequent generations of strategists, is oddly unwary, at the very least.  The reader should be wary on encountering in the 2002 Introduction such passages as these:  "Most of us, during the Cold War, would have given Marxist ideology credit for... teaching the peoples under Communist regimes to cease any hating of each other based on old ethnic differences." (p. xiii)  Well, no, I don't think most of us would.  This statement is made in service of Quester's point that the technology of weapons is more "malleable" than human intentions have proven to be -- but again he misses the whole intermediate step of crafting the military execution of those intentions, presuming that directing a war is no more complicated an act than pulling a trigger, and that therefore the weapon is everything.  This is indeed the bottom line of the book:  Quester has in mind the astrategic threat of nuclear weapons, and that colors all his conclusions.  In the Introduction to the 1988 edition he writes:  "The highest goal of the weapons planner...should be to design weapons systems that consistently and reliably reward the defense, making it to everyone's advantage to do nothing in a crisis."  Reading this on p. xxxi, one might be excused for seeing no great reason to continue further.  And with the exception of a few useful insights on the dynamics of balance of power politics and defensive alliances, one would be right.   
 Hello,  I happen to just borrow this CD from a good friend of mine and didn't find it that appealing.  Note I'm a huge Putumayo fan.  I love a lot of their stuff (Arabic Groove, Rumba Flamenco, Coffee Lands, and more).  In terms of what I don't like is it doesn't really give me a good "reggae" feeling.  This CD may be great for those who like it and listen to it a lot.  However for those new in this department I'd recommend finding something a little more "popular."  Anyhow as I said just a heads up to those new to the reggae scene.  I hope you find my post at all helpful.  Have a nice day 
 This book was such a disappointment to me! The majority of her information is completely inaccurate. I would have expected a little more coming from a dietician. The only thing I can say about this book on a positive note, is a few of the recipes are okay and she supports breastfeeding. I felt like this book was/is right with our culture...focused on how mom looks after having a baby. New mom's have enough on their plate worrying about how to adjust to this little person who's taken over their life. They don't need another book emphasizing how their body should look or perform. Every mom is different, I know.  I just think mothers should be focused on breastfeeding successfully and loving their sweet baby, not trying to fit into prepregnancy pants 2 weeks postpartum. A lot has changed in 14 years and new mom's need to realize that as well...this book is 14 years old. Good luck 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 I really think that this book spends entirely too much time on stories.  The stories were boring and I related to none of them. This book just made me feel more organized than ever and that I was totally wasting my time.   You have to weed through a lot of useless stories about unorganized people to get to any solutions.  Totally wouldn't buy again.  I'm taking it to my local half price book store.  Look for it there 
 It dose good for the bikini area. However you have to hold it at a back angle for the tweezers to grab the hair properly. It did not work on legs at all. It would pull a few hairs but broke the rest. With out the guard it feels like it is scraping the skin. The tweezers area is so small it would take a week to finish a leg even if it did grab the leg hairs. Razor attachment dose not work to my satisfaction. 
 This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.  Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.  Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention 
 "Hunting Warbirds" primarily relates the story of the location and extraction of an RB-29 lost in Greenland in 1947.  As a story about modern archaeology it's fairly interesting, as a story about warbirds and collectors, it's superficial.  Other reviewers have clearly outlined the rambling nature of the prose: we go from Greenland, to the States for an interview with a "unique" collector (that doesn't really shed insight into Warbird Enthusiasts, except to say that some are obsessed. Anyone's who's been to a gaming or Star Trek convention can observe the same behaviors in the minority of attendees), back to Greenland.   But as I said above, "Who's the audience here?"  One of the concepts I was taught in my undergrad days was to write to the knowledge base of the target audience.  Mr Hoffman, seems to have ignored this advice in this work.  His NUMEROUS inaccuracies regarding WW2 aircraft, and aviation are enough to put off aviation enthusiasts, (the logical target audience) while the narrow scope of the book would discourage general readers.  The inaccuracies themselves always leave that "what else is missing, misquoted or just plain wrong here?" notion in the back of your mind.  This is frankly surprising since his resume includes "Air & Space" and "Smithsonian" magazines.   Finally, a better book would have at least summarized the efforts in Finland, Germany, and Russia to recover some of their warbirds from WW2.  Operations that in ethnocentric America, don't get their deserved attention. If you are an aviation or WW2 aircraft enthusiast, you already know this story-the book offers no addtional insight-certainly none into WW2 salvage as a whole.  If you have a slight interest in the subject matter, the documentaries about the salvage operation are a better medium 
     I read a good short story by Franzen in The New Yorker a couple years ago, but this book is lame, lame, lame.  The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects.  Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney.  If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs.  I hereby declare this book Unreadable 
 This book is nothing more than fascist cold war propaganda. According to the author, the tiny American Communist Party (thoroughly infiltrated by the FBI, I might add) and its leader Gus Hall have secretly controlled the United States for decades now. The author provides no documentation for this allegation, no verification at all, he just reads Gus Halls self important public statements, then tries to show how this proves that Gus Hall controlled some policy of the government. This book would be very funny if it were only better written 
 I tried really hard to like this book, but I found it just a poor rehash of information already put forward by William Sutherland D.O, the father of Cranial Osteopathy and John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., the developer of CranioSacral Therapy.  For a true Visionary approach to "CranioSacral" work, you should consult the works of Sutherland and Upledger 
  I was about to get in touch with you because my purchase has been a disaster. All 3 DVDs are not compatible with the European standards, and it says on the back of at least one of them that the item are not allowed to be sold outside USA and Canada. I did of course not recognice this before I had given them away as a present to my parents, they had for such a long time wanted these movies. It was a sad moment when they put the first DVD in the DVD player. So they are of course all unwrapped because I was sertain that a well known company like yours did not fool around with theyr customers......I am so dissapointed.I had to pay toll on them as well when they came to Norway, so if I get 3 new ones send I will have to pay toll once more???? Then the purchase is becoming rather expensive for me. So what can you do to make amends? I am rather angry about this. Rang 
 After reading all the good reviews on this book I decided it must be worth reading.  While I agree that there are alot of problems with watching television the arguements he gave were insane.  Half of the book didn't appear to have anything to do with television.  He blames things such as people commiting crimes and mental health problems to watching television.  He also said something about people substituting telelvision light for real, natural light.  He also talks about evolution and, as a christian, I don't buy into that and don't want to read a book that teaches that as a fact.  It's definately a book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone 
 I am 38 and considered obese, however I work in a busy operating room all day and found this to be too easy. This DVD would be great for the older generations. I still need to loose 45 pounds and I am using Denise Austin's Burn Fat Fast. 
 This book is lacking for sensible sturcture. Seems to put a reader into a maze and leaves them wondering where there at. There are enough topics but their too full of proofs to really understand what the book is trying to explain. This book would even be diffucult for a graduate student that's using it for review. The author seems to be proving his mathematical talent instead of trying to explain the topics in a manor that's understandable to the average reader 
 We ordered this case/auto mount for our Philips PET710 7" Widescreen Portable DVD Player because it was the one recommended by Amazon.  I needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler.  I eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift), but it has a number of drawbacks.  -In order to mount it, you have to remove the top half(huh?).  Having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose.  I accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when I drove away.  -It's too small.  The Philips portable DVD player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case.  Plus (and this is really amazing), it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the DVD player.  I have to carry the headphones and sleaved DVDs seperately!  I chose my last DVD player b/c it came with an auto mount case, and even though I like the Philips DVD player, I'd do that again if I had it to do over.  Having the right case/mount for your DVD player is that key 
 I like Al Franken, I consider myself left-wing, I listen to Air America radio when I can and usually enjoy his show. I thought that this CD would have like the best clips taken from the show, stuff like real discussions with real guests which were especially funny, instead this CD features only gags with fake guests which are all not very funny. This CD was a waste of time and I turned it off about 30-40 minutes into it (about 30-40 minutes too late) Don't waste your money like I did 
 ...it's spelled "poseurs", not "posers".  Most likely, if you don't know how to spell it correctly, you very well may be one.. 
 PRIME TIME was originally published under the pseudonym of Rachel Ryan.  This is a story about a TV reporter, Andrea Malone who wants a network job. She's sure an interview with a retired US General in Texas will get that job for her if she can reveal his reason for the self-imposed seclusion. The only thing she has trouble with is his son, Lyon Ratiff. The anger, suspicion and uneasiness leads to love.  Wow, does anything not lead to love with Sandra Brown?  PRIME TIME has a good story line, but nothing surprising in the plot line. The characters are strong but not as developed as they could be. If more depth were given to the characters, it may have led to a few twists and turns that were unexpected and would keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat!. Don't change your schedule to fit this book in, just use it to stop gaps in your schedule and you'll be happy! 
 i must address several untruths in ms. oates book.while she is certainly a good writer,apparently she didn't do much research for this book.she states that the majority of soldiers killed and who served in the vietnam war were black;wrong.blacks made up 12 percent of the u.s. population at the time,and 14 percent of the casualties.the average soldier who died in vietnam was a middle-classed white boy.next she states that champ jack dempsey was afraid to fight black fighters;wrong.he fought at least 3 black fighters that is easily verified,and his chief sparring partner was black.his promoter tex rickard wouldn't allow it,for fear of race riots.harry wills the top  black fighter of the time was afraid to fight middleweight harry greb.he also sustained a horrific beating at the hands of white heavyweight jack sharky.jack johnson admitted that the only acknowledged fight he lost was to joe choynski.while the "saintly" joe louis was dringing,doing drugs,and cheating on his wife,max scmeling was freeing jews in germany.incidentally max scmeling and jack sharky are both still alive at nearly one hundred.do some research please 
 The Rocketeer is the cinematic version of all the faux-Deco buildings that have been erected in recent years around Los Angeles, particularly the Miracle Mile area. It's wafer-thin nostalgia masks a chintzy story that can't stand on its own two feet.  The plotting of The Rocketeer is sound enough for adolescent fare. Unfortunately, the characters are totally uninspired and the dialogue atrocious. Worse still is the execution of the material. Every actor is miscast and thoroughly lacking in charisma. Bill Campbell -- ever hear of him anymore? He overacts every single scene. Timothy Dalton? Hammy. Jennifer Connelly is the only one to come out unscathed.   The direction is beyond weak. When The Rocketeer appears at the nightclub it is so poorly staged, so cloyingly "goofy" that it extinguishes the promise of anything remotely thrilling from happening. Add to this foul mixture a horrendous James Horner score... you get the idea. Still, some nice set design and an effective animated film-within-a-film make for a couple high points. 
 James Horner has the reputation as a fine composer of film music, but he can also easily be placed in with John Williams, et. al. in the gamut of "film composers who blatantly borrow from classical music composers."  Williams is primo facto enemy no. 1, but Horner has been known to dip into the 19th century music barrel from time to time for ideas.  Alas, the soundtrack to "Willow" is one of these times.  As well as the music works in the film, and I believe does, this reviewer just cannot get over the similarity between the 'Escape fromt the Tavern" theme and the third movement of Schumann's "Rhenish" Symphony.  One would hope that he was not "phoning" this score in, but I cannot imagine I'm the only one to make this connection 
 This is no 'feel the peel' in actually fact i was really dissapointed at how uninspired it really is. The versions on 'rowdy duty' are far, far superior and virtually unreconizable. The jamming is kept to a bare minimum and when they do stretch out it just meanders with no punch. What really irritated me was the silly dialogue between some of the songs, it just isn't very funny. If you like the track 'bone' (i think it is dull) then the psuedo reggae grooves on this will be a bonus. Then again when it is good it is worth the purchase (i'd say about 50/50) There just isn't enough of that gritty funk which reminds me of the highly underrated Cold Blood and vocalist Jen is up there with Lydia Pearce as ine of the great funk singers. When she cuts loose it makes me realise just how great DBB really are, but it isn't enough unfortunately. Don't take this often  poor effort as a introduction, go to the other albums first. For completists only, but then again anything with Jen on vocals is worth buying 
 The paw works but the quality is very low.  It is made out of cheap plastic and I found paper stuck inside.  The bell rings randomly as others have noted.  The random ringing happens if the button gets stuck down.  It doesn't always pop back up after it is pushed.  It isn't even water  resistent for those thinking of putting it outside.  The intercom part works fine and seems to be of decent quality.  The barking  option is just irritating though 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
      A terrible book, what happened? Something about an orphan boy meeting vampires and zombies. What's that supposed to mean? The second half of the book is terrible. A third person omniscient view. Hinton needs to be a better writer to make it entertaining. Overall, this book was an absolute CHOKE!!! I regret having wasted five days of my life reading this book 
 ...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.  If you want to get an "inside view" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!  What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.  The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!  I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.  I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed.. 
 On the shelf or on line, this trucks shovel appears to lock into position above the rig but it doesnt. It took me nearly 10 minutes to remove strapping anchored to this truck within the packaging. My son spent a minute playing with this truck only to move on to his other toys. Yeah, the shovel portion drags on the floor and will NOT lock into position above the rig. This truck can hardly be moved through the carpet much less in sand. I grew up with Tonka trucks and this was obviously designed by some young suit that was babysat by the television and playstation. If your looking for a durable fun truck for your child, move on as this truck wont get the smile your looking for.   
 How awful was this book. I had more questions than answers. Talk about speculations, and what ending. I wrote the author because I was hoping he could help me clear up some questions I had. He did respond - "I don't discuss my books". Therefore, I will no longer buy and/or read his books. That is my own RAGE 
 I should have known, with a Dedication, Acknowledgments, an Introduction, and 5 epigraphs before Chapter One even begins, that this book was in trouble. Some nuggets of interesting information are buried in awkward writing, and terrible editing. P. 43, last line, is missing the word "he." On p. 41 the author is off by 50 million people as to the current U.S. population. On p. 104, President Eisenhower did not begin his second term until Jan. 1957, not Jan. 1956.    In an amateurish manner, the author tries to relate then-current events with the arc of Armstrong's life. In the process he butchers the former, drawing away from the wonder of the latter. More errors: on p. 223, he gets the directions of downtown Chicago all wrong: the Conrad Hilton hotel is not off Lincoln Park, but Grant Park. On p. 247 the author goes so far as to blame the Apollo 13 disaster on Jim Lovell: not even Hollywood took things that far!    On p. 279, the author should realize that the mini-van saved Chrysler, not Neil Armstrong's advertising campaign! And on p. 288, President "Reagan" is spelled "Regan," and in reciting the Challenger speech, the author misses the key passage of one of the great presidential speeches of history: "slipping the bonds of earth . . .""     Don't waste your time with this book. I listened to the author on C-SPAN2's book notes a few weeks back, and it is apparent from his shallow comments why this is such a weak effort. I just wish I had seen the show BEFORE I wasted the $ on this book 
 Before you devote a lot of time reading his work, you ought to look up Reich's biography on Wikipedia.  He was incredibly prolific and is notable for having written against Fascism and come out against Communism long before it was fashionable.  He is also known for inventing the infamous "orgone box" and ending his days in jail for medical quackery and a remarkably incompetent defense.  His work is dense and inadvertently thought provoking, but mostly manic and meaningless.  It should be preserved, but not widely read 
 I practice patent law, and believe there needs to be a serious reconsideration of intellectual property rights and economic incentives for research in this country.  Unfortunately, I cannot take this book seriously, and will return it rather than finish reading it. In reading perhaps 30 pages of the book, I noted quite a number of basic errors or mischaracterizations of patent laws and the basic mechanics of obtaining patents.    Perhaps he has some good arguments to make about IP rights. I might even agree with some of them. However, he has either failed to do his legal research properly or he has deliberately mischaracterized patent laws. Either way, his credibility is shot with me 
 Took me forever to get through, slow and difficult to follo 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 One of the 1/4" rings snapped the first time I put it on my rolling pin. 
 What has happened to Monster's quality?  In 2003-04, I had a discount on Monster cable through my employer and purchased close to $1000 (retail prices) worth of their cables for wiring up my home theater. I have been using the Gamelink with s-video for my PS2 and that works great. Here it is 3 years later and I buy these Gamelink 400 for use with my new HDTV with component inputs. When I tried to install them I thought I was going to snap the connections off my TV because of the amount of force I had to exert. With much determination I got them to connect. I switched on the PS2 and experienced no video just sound. I had even a harder time removing them. When comparing these cables to my older s-video Gamelinks the differences are the new wires are lighter, rigid and the connectors are definately too small in diameter.  In hand, they feel cheaper compared to the heavier more pliable older wires. I will no longer buy Monster cables and I do not recommend these to anyone. Audioquest is much better.  Too bad they don't make gaming cables 
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
 I have read this book, Mr. Moon's "Divide and Quit", Mr. Khosla's work, "Stern Reckoning" amongst others on the subject of the Partition. Ms. Butalia's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy, that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one's thoughts and mindset. Almost a diatribe, if I may. I will agree with what john_galt_who has written. I think he has hit the nail on the head. I did not consider this book worth either the money or the time 
 I feel this book left me with more unanswered questioned than answers.  What should I expect from the calf?  How do I get it from place of purchase to the field?  What do I do with the left-over animal parts from butchering?  Where do I get the calf?  Would it be better to buy a heifer?  What are the advantages 
 First off, I'll admit that I didn't read the whole book.  Now I'll say my peace on it.  Hacker generalizes broadly about the behaviors and sentiments of both whites and blacks.  Though white himself, he seems to absolutely  despise whites across the board as either racist scum or well-meaning but  idiotic.  Then he says that Martin Luther King Jr. only came to prominence  as a leader of the civil rights movement because the whites in power chose  him.  It sounds to me as if Hacker thinks that the black population were  too ignorant to choose there own leader and allowed the whites to give them  their hand-picked MLK Jr.  The thought of that makes me ill.  Apparently,  in Hacker's world view, everyone except himself is either evil or stupid.   But it was very entertaining 
 I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric. After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read. At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut 
 Broke within 12 hours of purchase - very cumbersome and non-flexible for different types of cars.  Wouldn't recommend 
 The writer used to many big words making the book very hard to understand. The book was very hard to read and impossible to understand. This book was not written for the average reader.  
 I wanted to like this book, but I found it disappointingly thin.  I wouldn't go so far as the previous reviewer and dismiss it as "hopeless", but it's certainly superficial: Postman seems to rely on secondary sources about Enlightenment thought, rather than any deep reading of Enlightenment texts.  The idea of "building a bridge to the 18th century" seems more like a marketing device, a fresh way of presenting some of Postman's familiar themes, than a serious proposition (He even includes a summary of his "disappearance of childhood" argument in an appendix).  It's a shame, really, because the Enlightenment has been getting too much undeservedly bad press for far too long, and Postman is correct when he points out that we owe much of what's good and admirable about contemporary society to Enlightened thinking.  For a much more substantial survey and defence of Enlightenment thought and culture, read Roy Porter's _The Creation of the Modern World: The British Enlightenment_ 
 Disapointed - this is a good 'couple of pages a sitting' bathroom read of occasionally amusing stuff. Perhaps a week's worth of quality turned into a year with silly suggestions and pictures! For a life changer I'd go with Danny Wallace's Join M 
 The most frequent advice the author seems to give, is "Take a sabbatical". Iberra ofers little advice for the person who is ready for change, but simply can't afford to make it. If you make less than six figures a year, you'll find yourself asking "Uh... what am I going to eat while I do that?".     Beyind this, though, the book does deal with how to emotionally navigate the hurdles of being "between two worlds" while changing careers, so it's not a total loss.     Myself, I find that I fell into a career track that I never wanted, and know I want out. I need the financial and navigational help to move back towards where I wanted to be originally, or find something new. This book doesn't provide that, as much as the emotional support needed to convince yourself you really have chosen the wrong path.    If you're wealthy, this book will work for you. If not, you may want to look for another one, as this one has some items of use for you, but you'll have to work to find them 
 Very basic techniques for the readers new to spiritual healing. Nothing new or that has not been said better by more advanced authors 
 The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these "packaging engineers" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and the hard packaging almost broke them!  But I was thrilled.  A handsome object, thought I, and I loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open.  So much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband.  I yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed.  But, alas, it would not follow instructions as they were written.  "Press and hold the Set button.  Hour display blinking."  (Could they not have said, "The hour display will blink"?  I pressed.  "Press Memory button to adjust the hour."  I did.  The Memory button never did a thing.  So I asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either.  We both tried several combinations of maneuvers, but nothing worked.  To this moment, the hour display is blinking, blinking, blinking.  I'd like to get my money back, but ya know what?  J & R Music & Computer World in NY demand such a rigamarole to send it back, including with all the original packaging (I threw the OP in the trash), that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions, which, of course, are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves.  Now I'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash, while I will make sure I never order from J&R again.     
 I love art and SF fantasy illustration and I am an admirer of Lovecraft's writing skill and imagination. The cover art on the book is great! The interior work does not suffer for quaility, so why the low review?  Because I found the book itself disappointing, it lacks inspiration. I have seen most of the images online. I don't doubt that many of the artist are fellow fans of Lovecraftian lore and imagery, but they (as far as I know) got paid to paint these illustrations for the CoC card game, hardly a paeon to the muses.  To be fair, I was warned by several of the reviewers of what the contents amounted to, it was the reviewers who were gushing about a book with a fair amount of mediocre art work that I could have paid less heed to.  If you are desperate for Cthulhu related images, get it. If your merely curious, let it pass. 
 I enjoyed the "Open Water", but this sequel fell flat.  It's really a shame, because the film makers had all the right elements in place to create a really good film.  The title should have been, "Open Water 2: Wasted Potential".  The characters were interesting until their IQs were reduced during the film.  The concept of the film was great:  6 people may die in spite of being able to touch their muli-million dollar yacht.  Safety is inches away, yet they cannot reach it.  Wow, that really had my interest.  Some reviewers said it was a good movie if you can just overlook the stupidity of the characters.  That is probably very true.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't do that.  Every time they had a chance, they did something stupid.  Often, all 6 let something stupid happen without even one speaking up.  I watched 100% of the film, just to see what happened, but I was completely disappointed with the film.  It wasn't terrible, just very weak 
 While this radio has several cool features, including VHF (channels 2-13) TV reception, it disappoints when the listener is trying to tune into weaker FM stations. It loses the signal or is overwhelmed by stronger stations when the wearer walks just a few yards. If you only listen to stations with strong signals, this is a good buy. Unfortunately I listen to the Bay Area NPR station for which this radio is relatively useless. It also does a poorer job indoors 
 The West Wing is my favorite television show of all time.  Period.  Nothing else comes even close.  I could go on and on about the show, but others are doing an excellent job on that score, and that's not my point here.  My point is the awful, awful DVD.  No English-language subtitles (for the second year in a row).  Only two special features, both about the debate episode.  No insight from the actors about their take on seven years of ground-breaking television.  No tribute to John Spencer.  I feel as if the folks at Warner Brothers Television knew they had their market well in hand, so the quality of the product really didn't matter.  "No bother, we'll sell enough anyway."  I'm one of those that bought it anyway, but I feel as if I got ripped off.  
 As a Spike fan, I should have listened to the warnings. But I figured if Spike is in it, I want to read it. I couldn't finish it. It was just too frustrating and angering. Spike is seriously injured saving Angel's life, still lying in bed unrecovered but instead of thanking him  Angel is hatefully insulting and threatening him. Not only is this insulting to Spike's character but Angel's as well.  The same goes for Buffy's treatment of Spike. It makes her seem like a horrible person.  I can't tell you whether it ends well because I only got halfway through. I am an extremely fast reader so normally I would just bite the bullet and finish quickly but in this case it was just raising my blood pressure too much. If you hate Spike you'll probably cheer but other than that skip this book. 
 It's NOT my imagination.  At NO time during this album does Willie -- when you can hear him over the band -- sound as though he's having a good time (and I forced myself to listen to whole thing TWICE just to be sure).  There are only two potential keepers: "Yours Love" and "Sad Songs and Waltzes."  But they're not even worth the price of a second-hand album. Album credits ought to read: "The Cardinals, with background vocals by Willie Nelson" -- expect it the other way around, and you'll be disappointed 
 I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.  The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.  Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.  The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's naï¿½ve and unique generosity.  That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.   For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!  In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.  She wants readers to get an "insight into the psychology" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.  My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.   I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is "The Virgin's Lover"... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel "The Queen's Fool" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful "Earthly Joys" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)  So, get "The Other Boleyn Girl" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).   But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's "Legacy" 
 I was very disappointed with the ending of this new Danielle Steel.  It seemed like a very long read, with a very quick ending.  I have read every one of her books, and have never been so disappointed with a story until now.  I would not recommend this to anyone 
 Life is too short for this sort of thing. I even gave up on this book listening to an unabridged version on tape. I can't even imagine what reading it would be like with its ultra-dense, paragraph-averse style. Who would have thought that authors were this self-indulgent even back in the 30's!  Skip the entire ridiculously undecipherable book and read the chronology and geneaology in the back! Join the ranks of proud low-brows who have other books to read and enjoy!   
 The only way that this book could be entertaining at all is if you go into it expecting nothing.  I was very disappointed in the writing.  The style is cheesy and the storyline is shallow and lame.  I had thought that this book was going to be a fun 'chick' book but the only 'chick' that would enjoy it lives in a barn 
 This picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick. A rather pointless attempt to remake Brewster's Millions with an altuistic slant. It wasn't a "bad" movie it simply wasn't a "good" one. Boooooooring...zzzz..zzzz..zzz 
      This novel could have been a long short story or a novella. One event takes place in the story and Perez-Reverte milks it for all he can. There are plenty of  historical  persons such as poets, playwrights, and painters thrown it. This is basically a one episode tale. I rate this a B-. 
 While, this book was informative, it was a chore to read. While chronological, it seemed disjointed and was difficult to finish. I couldn't believe this book won some sort of award and only slogged through it because it was a gift from someone who met the author at a wedding 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL 
 This little book includes four stories -- "James in a Mess", "Bertie's Chase", "Percy and the Signal"  and "Percy Proves a Point".  Each story is accompanied by photographs from the video series.  My complaint is that the stories are confusing and not well told 
 Considering buying this vacuum?  Then just throw the money out the window.  I was so disapointed by this vacuum.  It does not pick up pet hair, it doesn't even pick up lint.  It's very good at  picking up dust, but, that's all.  It also if FABULOUS at getting over-heated very fast.  If you are looking for a great waste of money, and a fabulous workout from all the back and forth motion of desperately trying to get this to pick ANYTHING up off of a rug, this is the machine for you.  If you're looking for a reliable light-weight vacuum -- look else where 
 we got this for our son for Easter, and he was playing with donnie the dumptruck, and the handle part was opened, so it was the flat blue portion of the truck, well he some how slipped, and ended up cutting his forehead b/c the blue portion does have somewhat of a sharp part. Luckily enough it wasn't where he needed stitches, but still...so I called Little Tikes, and they said they wanted me to mail it back and they let me choose another toy-so there Customer Service at Little Tikes is Definitly a +! Just watch out because I think the ages on this toy should be a little older. Semper F 
 If you don't know Pilates and would like to find out what really works in your body while practicing Pilates, don't buy it! The general part of the book is pretty good, although you start wondering at times if you should take the book seriously or not. I think the back of the book, with the exercises and all, is pretty useless. Most of the drawings of the exercises are faulty! Maybe someone with no or very little Pilates experience drew them and, somehow slipped by the authors who didn't stop publishing those bad drawings. The general part and, especially the posture part is very useful. For biomechanics I would rather suggest to look up one of Joseph Muscolino's books, especially his new book titled: "Kinesiology". Although, you could use this (Anatomy of Pilates) book to find out about the core abdominal muscles and pelvic muscles (a little!) and, how and which ones we use in Pilates. You can also learn about a couple of basic muscles that play a role in Pilates. It is still a far outcry from all the muscles and mechanisms that are involved in practicing Pilates. And just to point out some, does not do justice for Pilates! I am a Pilates instructor apprentice and, I think the book is a lot of fluff. If you are a trainee also, I suggest that for your anatomy and biomechanics turn to a more professional and credible source than this book. The book is very slim and quite expensive to just take a look at it! It is not a really good reference either! Very unprofessional at some level! Get this, they actually wrote this in the book:"Pubis - okay, it's the pubic bone". I am not joking, they actually printed it like that! I think that says a lot about the book 
 Please Sid -- with the dissapointment of CivIV, and now Railroads, say you haven't jumped on the "easy" bandwagon like so many other game designers.  Sid -- the reason we purchase these games is because YOUR name is on them. This game seems like it was made for a 12 year old, not someone who's grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games.  Please -- the next game you release, make sure it lives up to the standards YOU created. After this, just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account 
 I own several great digital cameras. It seems like I get one for each use - one with good zoom, another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others. This one I wanted for the high MP in a small compact size that I can put into my pocket. The first few photos were great, taken outdoors in my sunny patio. Then every picture I took after that (same settings - fine, HQ, poster 10m etc... and vertical lines started showing on the LCD screen and the pictures were all washed out. When I download them on the computer, they look exactly that way too - with the lines and almost all white. I've played around with the settings (and I do know how to work them) but still it does the same. So time to return to find a better one. That's too bad since I read some good reviews and wanted to have it 
 I also ordered the Errol Le Cain and got the Jane Ray version!  What is the deal?  Why is this happening 
 Pinched my daughter's tush (even though it was opened all the way, it bent as she was getting on). She never went near it again. Have to be very careful as child is sitting down. 
 I was a little disappointed. There were a few tidbits that I liked but other than that, nothing I didn't know. Kind of a "preaching to the choir" kind of book in my opinion. 
 While a good idea, the truck is poorly made.  The truck pieces that hook together fall apart whenever my 4-yr. old son tries to roll it across the floor, and he ends up very frustrated.  I ordered a replacement for it, thinking we just had a defective one, but the new one has the exact same problems.  You're better off spending your money on something else 
 One of the worst movies i've ever seen, no real plot and acting is as bad as it can get. Not even Samuel Jackson's appearance saves this sorry excuse for a movie. Horrible. Awful 
 We meet Josie Flynn a soon to be divorcee, who is just starting to get over her divorce from Damien. For her winter vacation from work she is headed to New York for her cousin Martha's wedding. While on the plane, she is seated next to the charming and handsome Matt, the rock journalist, who is also recently divorced. They share their horror stories, and seem to becoming friends. Once they land in NY they decided to meet for an afternoon at the Statue of Liberty. After this point the book serisoulsy goes down hill. We are then treated to a cat and mouse game while Matt is looking for Josie. Throw into the mix an unbelievably lavish wedding, an affair (or 2 depending how you look at it), an ex husband who comes toting an expensive gift to win back Josie's affection, and a duck and it make a very unbelievable book. 
 Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman.  The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging 
 All the reviews of this book that I read included the words "Well written". This book has a good language, and includes good information on several parts of the world. But it still lacks something. I believe that Hamish McRae has not put enough stress on some very important economic regions, such as South East Asia (the Indian SubContinent), Eastern Europe and Eastern Africa. The only reason why that could be is because of incomple research. This lets the readers draw wrong conclusions about these parts. I would not recommend this book to a friend or use it for any sort of research

 David Lewis has quite a reputation that I have no interest in taking issue with, but I thought this book was just awful.  The basic idea is that, according to Lewis, any way that a world possibly could be, some world is. I admit the notion has a certain appeal--if you're an existentialist concerned about why anything should exist at all. (If not "nothing" then at least "everything" gets you out of explaining why A but not B.)   Probably he should just stop right there, because this is a philosophical theory that, even if it is correct, is utterly useless. Lewis' other worlds don't interact with our world...at all. They are so ridiculously many and various, the distributions of their properties aren't correlated statistically with the properties of our world...at all.  Years ago, as a graduate student in mathematics, I found my imagination drawn, oftentimes, to puzzles. Nonmeasurable sets, strange paradoxes like that of Banach-Tarski, pathological consequences of accepting various axiom systems...I see this now in our graduate students today; perhaps it's just human nature. In my case, thankfully, my academic advisor steered me away from this to more serious work, dealing with non-pathological structures having application to practical questions.     Here you get the very opposite...a blooming "Philosopher's Paradise", as Lewis puts it. On those of us who think that good philosophy should be marginally relevant to something meaningful, however, this paradise is quite lost. I'm fifteen pages from the end and I suppose I will probably finish, but so far it's been a complete waste of fifteen hours of my time.   I don't actually side with any of what Lewis calls his opposition, by the way, people who want, as he puts it, "Paradise on the cheap." On the contrary, I don't think any paradise can be had at any price, and most people who use the grammatical form of the counterfactual conditional (If it had been that A, then it would have been that B) don't really know what in hell they're saying. Probably what they mean is that the universe is a finite state Markov chain and that from some fixed initial point, most of the trajectories that go through A also go through B. Compare "if Michael Jordan had retired in 1989 then the Chicago Bulls would have won fewer than 6 NBA titles in the 1990s. (That this offhand analysis doesn't collapse to the material conditional when A is actual is almost certainly a point in its favor...the material conditional comes out true three-fourths of the time when the antecedent and consequent are completely unrelated...nobody intuits counterfactual conditionals as true when they come out materially true accidentally in some "nearby world"--counterfactual conditionals should be counterfactual supporting. That's just obvious, except to philosophers.)   Of course this won't handle cases like "If gravity were an inverse-cube relation then jelly sandwiches would taste groovier". If you're David Lewis, this is probably a perfectly good question to ask, or perhaps even analyze for seven pages, probably with a similarity metric and some kind of undergraduate cardinality argument.  
         With all the fuss being made over - An Inconvenient Truth - the movie and book by Albert Gore Jr., it is appropriate to review his 1992 book: Earth in the Balance. This review will cover two key aspects of this book: his so-called couple between carbon dioxide and temperature; and his extremism. 	Gore discussed the carbon dioxide (CO2)  - temperature relationship on page 94. He showed a graph of temperature  and atmospheric CO2 concentration plotted versus time over a span of 160,000 years. With the exception of one point, his graph comes from chemical analysis of two mile deep ice core samples from Antarctica and Greenland, which is valid and exciting scientific data. Gore has called the data behind this chart as the most compelling evidence of a correlation between CO2 and temperature change. 	Both variables exhibit a saw-tooth profile. The graph for each variable is of a similar shape, and appear to move somewhat in parallel. Based on such a chart Gore  made the claim that CO2 concentration and temperature have moved in lockstep over this period. The word lockstep is far too strong for a simple visual correlation. The implication is also made that the change in CO2 concentration precedes the change in temperature, and hence is the cause for the change in temperature. However, it is impossible to tell this from such a graph. Indeed one could just as easily claim the reverse.  	The behavior of these two variables represent the change in each variable due to the changes in other major variables, particularly the orbital parameters of planet Earth as it travels around the sun. Yet Gore is basing all of his conclusions on his eye-balled correlation. 	Further, this data is highly compressed and displayed over a space little more than two inches in width in his book. The basic time unit is estimated at 2,500 years per point. A single tic on this graph--say 1/32nd of an inch in width--would represent 2,500 years of history. Thus a mere 1/32nd of an inch would represent the huge number of weather events over 2,500 years, averaged to a single point. 	The second problem with this graph is the last point shown. This is not part of the scientific record. Rather it is one scenario projection, out of dozens of scenarios, of the future CO2 level. This step is particularly egregious as this point brings the graph height to seven inches, on a graph that would only be two inches tall otherwise. This is pure distortion and misrepresentation. 	This critique is a perfect example of Gore gaining some validity by "cherry picking" valid scientific data, but simplifying it, extrapolating it and misrepresenting the situation until it literally has no meaning. 	On a second subject, some of the writings by Gore are quite disturbing. Several quotes are examined. * In the first quote he equates the dangers to the environment to the dangers of nuclear war. "Nuclear war is an apocalyptic subject, and so is global environmental destruction." 	Can this be a truly sound judgement of the state of the environment after years of the EPA, after years of automobile fuel and exhaust improvements and after billions of dollars of environmental control investments in all our utility and manufacturing industries? * The next quote broadens the doomsday view to the ecology. "Today the evidence of an ecological Kristallnacht is as clear as the sound of glass shattering in Berlin." 	Again can this be viewed as a precise, sound and fair diagnosis of the ecological situation? In this quote he equates Americans' use of natural resources with Nazism. He goes on "...the environmental crisis is so serious that I believe our civilization must be considered in some basic way dysfunctional. "... In this terrible century... we have witnessed some especially malignant examples of dysfunctional civilization: the totalitarian societies of Nazi Germany under Hitler, fascist Italy under Mussolini ... in psychological terms, our rapid and aggressive expansion into what remains of the wildness of the earth represents an effort to plunder from outside civilization what we cannot find inside."  	Yes, in Gore's mind, our society's embrace of what he calls consumptionism, resembles Nazi Germany society's embrace of totalitarianism. * Next he contrasts the richness of nature to the emptiness of industrial civilization. According to Gore we live in an "inauthentic world of our own making. "Life can be easy, we assure ourselves. "We need not suffer the heat or the cold; we need not sow or reap or hunt and gather. "We can heal the sick, fly through the air, light up the darkness, and be entertained in our living room by orchestras and clowns whenever we like." Further into this quote he observes this false world was created by people to distract people from their psychic pain. He asserts that the world of leisure, air conditioning, industrial agriculture, modern medicine, and home entertainment is not good in itself. "It is but a fleeting sideshow." Finally he claims that only by somehow awakening from such in-authenticity will the cycle of psychic pain and environmental plunder be broken. It is not quite clear how Gore, who grew upo in a hotel, earned credentials to decide what is authentic in life and what is not. 	Gore seems to have come up with the following modus operandi. First he will proclaim an unprecedented environmental catastrophe is at hand. Next he will indicate only a handful of ignorant and unqualified dissenters oppose this assessment. Finally he would indicate that such dissenters are preventing him from moving ahead to solve this problem. 	As noted above Gore has a strange streak of extremism in his makeup. He clearly is not happy with our society. He equates environmental activists to resistance fighters. But does not this group of  activists include eco-saboteurs? Clearly Gore does not limit his concern to just the environment, but declares that we are in a midst of political, informational, inner-spiritual and deep philosophical crisis. He, I believe,claims to be the sole author of his book and to have put his heart and soul into it. He seems to believe in his book and all its comparisons of our society with Nazi Germany's or to the former USSR's. All of the above quotes and comments have earned him the extremist tag. 	No where has this been better exposed than in a 1995 column by Tony Snow. In this essay Snow contrasts statements by Gore  to those of the Unabomber. Snow noted that the vision advocated by the Unabomber sounds much like that stated in Gore's 1992 manifesto. The difference between the Unabomber and Gore is that Gore wants to achieve this via massive government bureaucracies, while the Unabomber would achieve this through mail bombs.	 	Al Gore's penchant for alarmism, inappropriate interpretation and outright misrepresentation in 1992, is surely food for thought as one reads his latest book or sees his movie 
 Now that the author has a little fame, he has re-released this dog of a book.  It is very disjointed and one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read 
 The series of lectures comprising this book show Pipes at his 'best', clearly justifying critics views of him as "among the most politically reactionary and intellectually unscrupulous of the "totalitarian"  school of American Sovietologists". This book provides a good  counter-analysis to the works of Figes, Fitzpatrick and Service, showing an  outdated 'top-down' approach to 20th century Russian historiography. A must  for those who wish to see the product of America's cold war generation of  intellectuals 
 The first book I read of Child's was Without Fail. The book was brilliant with a wicked main character and plot. I immediately went searching for more. Other reviews have pressed the notion that Reacher's vagrant style is slightly unrealistic and anti-civilization. Although I'd agree that in Running Blind (aka the Visitor) Reacher's near sightedness when it came to his living was rather annoying, in the other books I liked it. It added to Reacher's personality and his character.  However, Child has begun to take Reacher's need to isolate himself way too far. Running Blind made Reacher come off as slightly self centered and a rendition of the loose cannon hitman in the movie The Protector.  I don't have as much respect for the plot of Running Blind as I did the other books (especially Without Fail). It was predictable and highly unrealistic (in the sense of motive and killer).  I felt like the book built up so much and then just bombed completely in the end delivery.  Child has established his pattern. Reacher meets girl. Eventually has sex with her. Kills some bad guys. Girl gets killed (or they split up undoubtably never to see each other again).   It would be nice to see Reacher with the same woman for more than one book. Or to have him settle down even a little. Although it seems that this is the event which Child seems driven to never let happen.  One other thing that bothered me in RB more than it did in other books was that it seemed to me Child used a lot of shorter sentences in clusters. ie Reacher sat down. It was raining. Got up and opened the closet. Pulled on his coat and shut the door.  It seemed more pronounced in this book, but maybe it's just me.  It is a little hard that Without Fail was my first book. It set such high standards for the following reads, but I'll still read the remaining books. I have faith that there's at least one more great book in Child's line 
 What are all these 5 star reviewers thinking??? Aureolin and rose madder--Dobie's recommended yellow and red primaries, are extremely fugitive--they fade in a short time. Because of this alone, the book should be vigorously rejected as coming from dubious authority.  Her plan for making colors "sing," by the way, involves placing an occassional bright color in a field of grays or browns, mixed not from earth pigments, but from (fugitive) primaries.  It would be irresponsible of me to perpetrate such a book on an unsuspecting public by giving it any stars at all.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't have a "zero" stars option.  If you want a superior book that will show you much better ways to make colors "sing," get "Perfect Color Choices for the Artist," by Michael Wilcox 
 I was taken aback by how convoluted and overreaching this text was. I guess I expected more. I found myself having to read and reread certain paragraphs and sections of this book just to understand what Telford was attempting to say. I found his open hostility toward the traditional position of inerrancy troubling. One reviewer says that Work "shows how the paradigm of inerrancy is fatally flawed." He shows no such thing. He approaches the discussion and falls flat in his efforts. One way to make your point it to denigrate your opponent. This he did do. He seemed to imply that all who believe in inerrancy are lowbrow fundamentalists. Ultimately, Work's overhaul (i.e., paradigm shift) for viewing the Word of God was simply over the top and without warrant. I note that this book came out in November 2001, but I have yet to see Bible colleges and seminaries adopting Work's new paradigm and dialect, and with a sales ranking of 711,096, his book is likely not going to usher in his "new paradigm. 
 This movie lacked the luster I expect from Robert Duvall. It was an endless journey into boredom, at least for me 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of "Raise the Titanic", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent. Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story  Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved. Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one 
 As others have pointed out this first person/third person thing is quite hilarious.  After about the second or third time you come across this "Eller" fellow who seems to be always on the scene and always right, you look back and see his name on the cover.  But the funnier one is every now and then you can almost hear Jennifer Edstrom saying "and then mommy saved the day again ..."  However I did give it more than the minimum, because I do think there is value in getting a perspective from what it looked like from the front line.  I did finish the book, and I think I got some insight into Microsoft.    
 Granted, it must be challenging to be a writer when one's father is Arthur Miller. This book was receiving raves and I was so surprised to discover it was basically downright bad! Unreadable, frankly. I forced my way through the stories. They were full of cliched and vague descriptions, bland dialogue, and too many oh-so-quirky characters. More than one story had flashbacks ( one story had two: A 4 years ago flashback within a  1 year ago flashback). More than one story had a character recounting her dreams. Boring!!!!  Save your money and your time. 
 Terrorists strike an America oil refinery with a small nuclear bomb. In steps Major Jason Richter, Army nerd extraordinaire, with his super CID exoskeleton. The hero of the hour saves a busload of kids, along with a beautiful reporter, and promptly gets placed on the newest war-on-terror team. The team starts to tackle the terrorist group responsible, but the team seems to be set up for failure with conflicting personalities and egos. The battles rage on around the globe, as Major Richter tries to pull the team together, find the mastermind behind the plots, and save his country from another disastrous attack.  Techno, yes; thriller, no. This book started out with promise and I really wanted to like it. But after the introduction of the major characters and gadgets, it quickly becomes cliched and predictable. The nifty new weapons systems would play much better with believable characters and a realistic plot. The pacing is fast, but the many twists and turns feel forced. Dale Brown is perfectly capable of writing exciting techno-thriller books with good characters - but this is not one of them 
 This carrying case was a terrible purchase.  The zipper broke within hours and the Nintendo DS Lite doesn't really fit into it very well.  I was very disappointed.  My six year old used his own money to buy a G-Pak case, which is a much better case for the Nintendo DS Lite 
   I was hoping to be able to set up the LCC with this book, but apparently I needed to get the "How to Form an LLC" book (which I'm NOT going to do).    I've read the Nolo California Corporations book and it already covered much of the info here.  What I was looking for was help with writing good articles of organization and operating agreement (specifically for a 1-person LLC).   The operating agreement example he gives is not specific to a one-person firm.  A prudent person might change the language in his example operating agreement to reflect that the LLC is composed of just one person.  Also, the book does not cover the fact that in CA you can specify additional info in the Articles, such as rules for admitting new members.  Awfully light for "All you need to know" 
 I enjoyed the quotes, but this book is filled with artist bashing through and through, continually harping on the mental fragility of artists, their inability to get along with others, or participate in mutually supportive  communities.  The exercises promote feeling guilty and insecure about  seeing the world in unusual ways and imply that curtailing creativity will  lead to better adjustment.  The last chapter actually gives advice to the  artist about how to make a transition out of a life in the arts.   UNBELIEVABLE!   The organization "Artists for a Better Image"  has a web site that lists negative stereotypes of artists in the media.   The author parrots these stereotypes hook, line, and sinker.  The book  "Art & Fear" by David Bayles and Ted Orland is much, much  better as a guide to an artist's self-understanding.  "A Life in the  Arts" by Eric Maisel is a good book for artists, especially aspiring  artists, to avoid 
 GOOD SCALE - COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DESIGNE FOR FEET - FAT MEASUREMENT PRETTY CLOSE 
 I think there may be a hint of jealousy in this book.  I've often thought of Zizek as the kind of guy who strives to be the rock star of philosophy. Of course, more than ten years after his death, Deleuze is packing more philosophical arenas than Zizek ever will.  This is because, in my humble opinion, Zizek is and always will be a second rate philosopher.  He is the Douglas Coupland of academic philosophy in that, while he is often an interesting read, one always walks away from the book feeling like they've gained nothing but a few perverse ways of stating the obvious.  I will admit, Zizek has a flare for writing, notably, I think in the Ticklish Subject and Welcome to the Desert of the Real.  But this book not only failed to accomplish it's goals but it did so rather uninterestingly.  Somewhere around the end of the first third of the book he quotes Deleuze's famous passage about buggering other philosophers in the behind.  I've always loved the passage and til that point I thought the book was heating up so I had hopes of engaging in an eye-opening debate about Deleuze with both the text and my own preconceptions.  But what I got from that point on was a stream of endless, pretentious comparisions between what most people assume Hegel meant and what Zizek somehow interprets Deleuze to mean.    Basically, it seemed to me like Zizek's project was misguided in that it relied too heavily on a limited interpretation of Deleuze based on Zizek's slight admiration for the Logic of Sense and his disdain for Deleuze's work with Guattari.  Zizek almost comes off as a crying child who wanted ice cream when everyone else wanted cake and couldn't have his way.  He passes over without even the slightest mention the idea that perhaps A Thousand Plateau's truly is a revolutionary text (or radical series of texts - whatever).  He does this because he likes better the ideas he has developed out of the Logic of Sense.    In other words, Zizek is fatalistically attached to the offspring that emerged when Deleuze's logic of sense poked him in the butt.  The joke's on you, Slavoj 
 This movie is very weird and it makes you really dizzy. It shows you the end first and then shows you the events that lead up to it. Not a movie for children at all 
 I have a working copy of this book that was given to me while taking the product design course at the University of Texas.  The book would probably be a lot better if it had a good index, but since it was thrown together to give the class something to read, it doesn't.  I didn't use the book much for class, but have used it some since then.  This book uses design tools that are good in theory, but sometimes take too long to actually be used in a real situation (i.e. QFD) 
 I bought a set of king burgundy fitted and flat sheets.  It looks nice and feels soft and thin.  But the very first day I noticed some kind of very fine burgundy color dust coming off the sheets.  It gets stuck to sleepwear.  White air return vents in my bedroom became almost red in color with this dust.  The worst part is that the dust stays on the bed and is very hard to remove it even with a  vaccum cleaner.  I was careful to wash these sheets separately, I collected about two full cups of red dust from dryer vent 
 After reading all of the reviews, I thought this would be a good, insightful read for someone who is interesting in the culinary arts.  Instead, it's like listening to someone tell you a long boring story and you don't have the heart to stop them.  He goes on about little projects like finding the cheapest subsistence diet, the difference between ketchups, and all the ridiculous diets he has been on.  Very boring, inconclusive, and uninteresting.  Also, I wouldn't trust anyone's palette who likes Diet Coke as much as this guy.  $14 bucks wasted 
 Very simplistic recipes.  I saw Today show feature of tuna with wasabi and thought this book offered more creative recipes.  Do not purchase for any child over 13 
 It's hard to believe that the same scholar who wrote The American Century and Imagining the Law is the same expert that Anne Rice claims as her foremost source of medieval history. Norman Cantor's breadth of knowledge (and the varying degrees of it, covering everything from sweeping historical movements to epicurean minutiae) is truly incredible, and I find myself amazed by his attention to detail time and time again, whether he is dealing with the relationship between Einstein's theories and Cubism or the origin of the popularity of Madeira port in England.    Encyclopedic knowledge, however, does not necessarily yield an interesting biography.  Cantor attempts to do so in this book about John of Gaunt, the first Duke of Lancaster.  On the surface, it seems that it would be almost impossible to write a dull biography of John of Gaunt. The richest man in Europe who was not a king, a commander in the Hundred Years War, the father of Henry IV, the grandfather of Henry the Navigator, the benefactor of Geoffrey Chaucer and, briefly, John Wyclif - John of Gaunt appears as the apex of the high medieval era, a thinking man's warrior who lived life extravagantly and yet strictly abided by the chivalric code.  In William Manchester's hands, John of Gaunt would have been a sensational character indeed.  What deadens the presentation of such a colorful figure here, however, is that Cantor chooses to tell his story by using what he calls the "sociological approach."  I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it seems to be an appropriate description of the way in which Cantor uses the figure of Gaunt to illuminate different sectors of society.  Thus, by setting the military, financial, and romantic activities of Gaunt within their proper context, Cantor feels free to discuss the economic and political activities of the serfs and knights whose lives were circumscribed by Gaunt's power and influence.  We are also introduced to the royal families of England, Spain and Portugal, all of which included at least one member of Gaunt's immediate family.  However, despite the fact that Gaunt plays a key role in the war with France, the Peasant's Revolt, Richard II's fall from power, and, unwittingly, the institutionalization of racism (through the ideology constructed by Henry the Navigator), Cantor's Gaunt comes across as a typical billionaire, whose interests and occasional forays into philanthropy suggest a life as lavish and boring as today's CEOs who catch the public's attention only when their infidelities or swindles rise to the surface.     Furthermore, Cantor has an unsettling habit of numbering his points ("first of all...second of all...") which can give the narrative the feel of a textbook.  The only really interesting bits occur when Cantor suddenly slips into strange flights of fancy, such as when he composes an unintentionally hilarious imaginary love letter that Gaunt might have sent to his mistress, Catherine Swynford.  By the end of the book, John of Gaunt, poised at the edge of an era and facing the rumblings of social change with growing trepidation, fossilizes into the "aged, doddering" man of Shakespeare's play Richard II - the very representation that Cantor wanted to subvert when he decided to bring this man to life 
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 I would have given this film a slightly higher rating had it been filled with characters I admired or to whom I related. I mean, Aniston's character gets set up with a real jerk by one of her best friends (who knows this guy talks disrespectfully about women). Aniston, meanwhile, does a good job of playing a depressed, too-nice to people character who gets taken advantage of.   Catherine Keener's marriage seems troubled because she is overly concerned with other people's feelings and her husband seems blase about them, including those of his wife's.   It's sort of an okay character driven movie in terms of the acting, but the ending is not pieced together in a gratifying way...it sort of just leaves you there hanging with nothing concluded 
 Two of the short stories in this book, "Running out of Dog" and "Gone down to Corpus" are not new stories.  Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people.  But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original.    The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about.  None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation.  We waited a long time for another Lehane.  This book certainly does not showcase his talents 
 I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.         I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.    I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support.   I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer.  It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund. 
 Having travelled all over the USA by automobile, I was disappointed at the paucity of information and the highly selective coverage in this book.  I had hoped to obtain an update, and more comprehensive coverage of all 50 states.  I found it too selective with major ommissions by state (e.g. Kentucky has no entries at all) and smaller to mid-size communities such as Champaign, Illinois, or the beautiful Rock River valley of NW Illinois are conspicuous by their absence.  Most disturbing is this.  I live in the Greater Houston, TX, area, and read the authors' motel recommendation on US-59.  Not only is that motel and immediate area known for being a place of constant drug raids, but also it is a major area of known street prostitution and that motel seems to house them.  I hardly consider that "family friendly" 
 I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen.  As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story.  It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing.  The story's decent.  The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go?  Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe?  It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.  A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work 
 I just finished reading this book, and the one that follows it: The Cat who Dropped a Bombshell.  Both of them are disappointing and not worth reading. And I now realize what the problem is. Dear Lilian is not writing these books anymore. She's either deceased or retired. Someone else is writing them. A person who doesn't have a clue as to how to spin a good mystery story. All through this book I kept waiting for the mystery to be presented, worked on, spun out and then solved. But it never happened. The book was boring with all its details and run-on commentary about things going on in the town. The step-son is presented and disappears, murders are hinted at but never resolved, the "guilty party" is discovered at the end, but dismissed with a shrug. Mysterious circumstances are presented and then dropped. What's the point? If the publishers want to continue this series, then they have to find a new writer who has some mystery writing experience, who can follow in Ms. Braun's footsteps, and continue the series with style 
 Does anybody really care what the York Dumbell outfit did to exploit weightlifting or that Bobby Boy Puffman was just looking for a tax writeoff for his incredibly successful oil burner business?  I find this book boring and totally irrelevant. Recommend Dick Tylers West Coast Bodybuilding Scene instead of this one 
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters. After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings. The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right. Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record. For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' "Freak In" or the aforementioned E.S.T 
 Watch this outdated, macho, adolescent film and then watch Malick's 1998 remake. Watch how the exact same dialogue in the exact same scenes come out corny and inflected here and then watch the sublime subtlety of the new version. Dullea and Warden are wonderful, but overall this is just melodramatic pap 
 This product came lacking cables and proper documentation I have tried over 18 times via email and phone to get the proper items from the company The cust support tells me to go to tech support and vice-versa  They answer emails with one line and their support team is obviously foreign with a poor understanding of thier own products as well as the english language  Stay away from this company until they get their 'house in order  
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 i had to read this book in school.  it's horrible.  it's annoying.  There is no point to the story.  It isn't even fun to read.  I would keep reading, expecting something great to happen, but nothing ever happened.  i skimmed the last 25 pages--it was that boring.  there are quite a few typos in it as well.  everything about it is pure cliche.  the first few pages are good, then it stops.  it's like, mcdermott had imagination when she began writing it, then she went braindead.  i would not recommend it to anyone 
 Nrretranders is not a scientist or researcher, but rather a science journalist.  That isn't necessarliy a bad thing in itself, but his book clearly suffers for his lack of scientific training, and the rigour it would have introduced.  User Illusion reads like a series of breezy, vastly oversimplified pop-sci articles.  His concepts - ranging from info theory to thermodynamics, are strung together with the loosest of connections.  For example, he compares the information intake of our senses with that processed by our consciousness in terms of bits.  But, he clearly has no formal definition of a bit in mind, using it to refer to anything from an actual binary bit, all the way up to an entire piece of music.  This makes it impossible to take his comparison seriously.  Consciousness itself is never even formally defined.  His treatment near the end of the earth's energy intake, and even dirty diapers, in terms of information theory is laughable.  The only useful take-away here is the reminder that there is a lot more going on inside our heads than we are consciously aware of.  A useful reminder, but that should not be news to anyone.  User Illusion also makes a good index of current (in 1991) 'sexy' science topics such as complexity 
 As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent.     This book just didn't have the "zing" of the older Cussler stories.  If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read 
 "Karl Marx, years ago, gave a description of why this might be happening. He followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value: an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make."   NO IT'S NOT!!! An object's worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers. To imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a few minutes to make is worth far less than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an atomic bomb that took months to make, which would mean that we should subsidize the military-industrial complex, since all those workers worked hard to create those deadly things.   "Petty-bourgeois' owners, i.e. the mom-and-pop stores and small business in general, of which my grandpa, a dentist, was a part of, are being driven under by corporate chain competition in retail."   This is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the massive regulations burdened upon them by the government. All regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out. There's a reason why the owner's of Wal-Mart recently said that the federal government should increase the minimum wage to over $8, as this would cause many smaller businesses to go bankrupt, lay off employees, and prevent future businesses from starting up to compete with Wal-Mart. Another problem is the subsidies that the smaller store pays to Wal-Mart (Wal-Mart collects millions in subsidies due to Marx's Labor Theory of Value once again) and of the use of emminent domain abuse (which can be justified on the grounds of the "greater good" as opposed to the individual good of your mom and pop stores).   "But no theory is ever flawless, and socialists should be able to correct their past flaws to account for human nature and "reality." There is no reason to believe that heavy social hierarchy and class division is a necessary evil; workers CAN manage their lives just fine through cooperatives."   Sure there is. Human beings are inherently unequal, differing in many skills, abilities, ambition, the choices that they make in life, how they apply their time, etc. etc. Of course, there is isn't any reason that individuals can't create wealth nonetheless, creating goods and services that help others out in exchange for some good or service itself. And cooperatives need to be voluntary first. Nor can cooperatives produce the bulk of wealth.  There needs to be some Division of Labor, Trade and Commerce, etc. or else all cooperatives end up as hunter-gatherering tribes reduced to the real law of the jungle to survive.  This can't happen if everything is collectively owned.   "Since workers are the sole producers of goods from scratch to end"   NO! Entreprenuers, innovators, etc. provide much of the creativity, design, direction for the purchase and use of capital goods, negotiation of deals, evaluation of threats, problems, and consumer requests, and other such things. It wasn't the workers at Microsoft who created cheap desktop computers, it was Bill Gates, the workers are merely a form of mass-production who help out, but ultimately mass produce a good or service in exchange for privately owned wages, caused by supply and demand. 
 I love Mariah's voice and a lot of her older stuff. I have to agree with a previous review about the guest rappers though. There are several songs that just drone on and on and have no energy. I was looking for some good remixes of her songs and I was pretty much let down. Overall, I'd say this wasnt a good purchase 
 This book is an nice collection of differing points of views about latinos/hispanics. However it's primarily philisophical. It's more confusing than inspiring. It's great for those studying for a phD, but will not inspire average latinos to action. This book tilts slightly more towards the assimilationist point of view, although a few writers do express some pan-latino thoughts. 
 I bought a couple of Bob vidoes through Amazon for my son, age nearly 2, who loves the series. We were crushingly disappointed by these videos, though. The wonderful voices of the UK version (Neil Morissey et. al) have been replaced by American voices. WHY do they do that? For us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ain't Bob. British shoppers and anyone familiar with the original Bob should be warned. (Can I get my money back? 
 Most of the text is war stories meant to glorify the author. He has no experience at selling outside the field of real estate. Because of that this book has little of interest to those not in that field...and not that  much for those in it. If you sell real estate there are far better books  out there for you on how to build your business. If you sell something  other than real estate this book is of very little use. Mr. Hopkins primary  talent seems to be that of promoting...primarily himself. It may well be  that his blend of self promotion played well in selling real estate years  ago, but he is not a student of selling and is not in touch with the real  world as it now exists. There are much better books out there on  prospecting 
 Yet another disappointment.  This is not suited to self-study, very few exercises and no answers!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK! 
 This book really only covers a general concept of the computer animation field. For people wanting to just unearth the mere basics and lingo, the glossary at the end of each chapter might be useful. Besides that, the book lacks any real depth to the topics discussed, and is rather disappointing when these terms are freely available online. The "Getting Ready" tips for each section was laughable, written with the assumption that readers lack common sense. Furthermore, the unorganized structure of the book meant the referenced picture in the text is in MOST cases a few pages away. My 1 star goes to the coloured pictures and the glossary 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 Item was received bad, not able to use, and you refused to accept it back.  The response from Amazon was to resell it!!!!!!!! I also contacted the shipper and they also refused accepting the cradle back. I have contacted Magelan and so far nothing.   Either credit my account or send me a working part!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think I've screwed over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dale Nova 
 Summary: This book provides a very generalized overview of 1) how to prepare a marketing plan, and 2) a variety of marketing tactics from advertising to sponsorship, the internet and sales strategies.   Review: For the independent financial services sales rep that has very little background in marketing or sales this book may be useful. However, the book does not provide anything of value to a financial services firm of any size or any professional marketers. The book is not bad, but in my opinion (marketer working in financial services, 10+ years experience) it is really only of value to a novice independent sales professional who needs assistance with planning their own personal marketing activities. In fact, if I could make a recommendation to the authors it would be that the next version of the book should focus very specifically on just that. 
 This through the glass unit performed well enough for my needs as I am only looking for local traffic tie-up information of close-by autos....the problem is that it will not stay on the windshield....I am on my third unit in an attempt to get it to stay on permanently instead of a few weeks....the first one was put on by professional installers of all my 3rd party electronics ... have dealt with them for years as they do excellent work...it fell off and was lost after about 10 days....the second one I put on myself...and followed the directions to an exact degree....including the heating of the glue with a hair dryer for 4 minutes....cleaning the windshield as directed etc etc....using silicon to seal the unit further...this one stayed on for more than a month and then fell off and was lost....the third one was supplied to me directly by Midland at no charge, much to their credit....I havent tried putting on the third one yet because of the weather...I have my fingers crossed....would I buy this again....definitely not.....probably no through the glass units from anyone else either.............. 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 this thing doesn't work, nothing but black and white image and off center.  my video card is ntsc like it said but won't work on the 3 computers i have.  don't buy this, buy a video converter box 
 If you liked the original theatrical release (which was the first version of the film that made it to DvD) and own it, more than like you have all you'll need from KoH. I REALLY enjoyed the theatrical release, purchased it...and then later bought this version of the film based on many of its Amazon reviews. While it does add a great deal of watching time to the film, the extra footage really does little to improve the quality of the story or increase the depth of the characters to any "interesting" degree. Add to that, that this version of the film doesnt include the great documentaries(History Channel) found on the original DvD release. As I have shared, I REALLY enjoyed Kingdom of Heaven.....but didnt/havent found the purchase of this version to be an improvement over the original in the least. More doesnt always equal better.... 
 These guys are the worst. I wish they would crawl in a hole & never come out. One of the worst bands of our era 
 This book while well written contains too much stuff that Windows2000  Professional shares with WindowsNT.  It is not a good reference book.   Perhaps it would be better off positioned as an introductory text because  it has too much fluff 
 You can bet that if Peter David had lifted a cliche as hoary as the "I am Spartacus" moment for one of his stories, he would have at least given a nod to his source! Spock as messiah became fairly tedious, as did the rehash of 'old codger from OST becoming a liability and then proving himself' plot line from RELICS. Dry, humorless, with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick. I just don't get why Mr. Friedman is so popular. I've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the ST fiction offerings in the last few years - Kevin Ryan, Peter David, Greg Cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit, heart and intelligence. Like another reviewer here, I keep trying to like this author's books since he is so prolific, but damn it, Jim, Star Trek fiction should never be a chore 
 After I rescued 2 beta fish from very poor conditions, I needed some really good information on their care. I did not find it in this book. It has a couple paragraphs about diseases, absolutely no charts or diagrams for biology or anything, and while the pictures were really beautiful, they had nothing to do with the topic on the same pages. There is a lot about how to have beta fights, and speaks of it in a very condoning tone! This is quite cruel and inhumane. There is I grant you some decent very basic info that you could glean off the internet yourself in an hour or two 
 Talal Asad describes his book as an attempt to give an anthropological reading of the meaning and history of the 'secular', especially as it relates to modern Western thinking. What he does in practice, however, is muse on the various interpretations people in present and past have given to the term, make some random observations about religious practices, and delve into subjects only tangentially related to secularism (like human rights) or not at all (like the 'meaning of pain').  The book misses any greater 'storyline' or reasoning, making each chapter seem a separate essay, and not one very clearly connected to the one before at that. Now this would not be such a problem if the chapters themselves were insightful enough to cause the reader to view secularism or the importance of it in a new light. But unfortunately, this is not the case either. I don't know whether it's the anthropological way of analysing things or whether he is just too modest: but either way, he absolutely avoids making any judgement or even a conclusion, instead preferring to spend endless paragraphs pondering the genealogy of words and concepts. Every time it seems matters might get interesting, every time Asad seems to make the connection to current events or political theory, he seems to rebuff his own interest in the subject; invariably any mentioning of a moral judgement or a political analysis will be followed by "but I'm not interested in whether this is true or not, but only in showing that people have looked at it in this way".   It may be that I myself are simply too uninterested in cultural anthropology to find that exciting, but either way the whole book failed at even holding my passive interest at any point. The subject might have been a very useful and interesting analysis, and clearly Asad is intelligent enough to make one. But more's the pity that he apparently feels such an analysis is beyond the pale, making the book pointless and contentless 
 This book from Ralph Nader, George Bush's best ally and secret weapon, shows why the great New York Times writer Thomas Friedman has accurately described Nader as a creature of the lunatic fringe of American politics.  Nader's connection to reality is extremely tenous.  He is a latter-day Luddite, and his proposals have no chance of ever being adopted.  This is why he has chosen the role of spoiler.  If he can't be President, he reasons, why should Al Gore?  Better to let a right-wing monster like George W. Bush become President and destroy the country 
 Overall, not an entertaining book.  I struggled to stay interested in the story despite my track record of loving books having to do with any Hollywood subject matter.  I found the characters lacked depth and the end was incredibly cliche.  There was very little creativity at all 
 When I first saw this album I thought "Heavy D....WITHOUT The Boyz?!  That can't be a good thing."  Here's the problem with this album: Heavy D took the "jiggy" route.  When I heard "Big Daddy" for the first time, I thought it was pretty tight and that it had that Heavy D feel to it.  So after hearing that, I went and copped the disc.  When I got home and read the liner notes, my jaw hit the floor.  There was Heavy D....smoking cigars, iced out, and playing the big willie role (the popular theme for the "jiggy" crowd in '97).  At that point, I realized that original MCs were quickly becoming extinct.  After years of success with his group, Heavy D had jumped the fence while simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time.  That might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least somewhat decent.  There are about three tracks on the entire album that are even worth a listen.  There's a lot of lazy and predictable production (we're talking obscene amounts of beat jacking).  On "I'll Do Anything" Heavy D and Tony Dofat COMPLETELY jacked Hall & Oates for their tune "I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)" and it only gets worse throughout the album (I won't even get into how the Gap Band's "Yearnin' For Your Love" was abused on "Keep It Comin'").  There aren't enough good songs on this album to make Heavy's change of heart seem very believable.  Avoid this album y'all.  It's not completely terrible, but it comes dangerously close.  There are songs that border on wack and there are songs that are completely wack.  Sadly enough, this can be said for the majority of the songs on this album.  I was very disappointed in Heavy D and lost a little respect for him after hearing this.  I can only reccomend buying this if you can find it used for less than $3.00.  Otherwise, avoid at all costs.  Standout Tracks: Big Daddy (My Favorite) and "You Can Get It" feat. The Lost Boyz & Soul For Rea 
 A few good ideas that could have been a good chapter in another book 
 I bought a XD to CF adapter, as per the picture on the page. Instead I received, as others did, a PMCIA adapter which is not what I wanted or needed. For the first time, I felt cheated by Amazon and don't know what to do. Hope to receive some explanation 
 If you'd like to enter Dennett's Fantasy Land of self-satisfied, materialist reduction then this is the book for you.  If, however, you're looking for a work by a philosopher who can critically examine and defend his own theories and presuppositions then this book will probably strike you as a monumental waste of time.  To be sure, Dennett knows how to construct arguments -- the problem is that they're question-begging arguments.  And unless you share Dennett's materialist presuppostions you're going to find almost every page of this book filled with question-begging naivet.  Dennett, of course, has his reasons.  He claims that Cartesian Mind-Body dualism leads to unsolvable problems, hence we should resolve such dualism in favor of the tanglible Body and think like good (that is, consistent) materialists.  (And never mind philosophy prior to Descartes -- especially Aristotle, for whom the word "body" necessarily implies an informing and organizing "soul" or "form".  Such a "form" is, in Aristotle's account, precisely the reason why bodies are organized and not simply inchoate matter.  But never mind all that.  Dennett isn't really interested in the history of philosophy, the meanings of words, or an opponent that isn't a straw-man.)  But, despite Dennett's insistence on materialist consistency, the book is plagued by an inconsistent double-think which brings back the Mind-Body problem in its full force.  We have (or seem to have) immediate experience of our own minds or consciousness.  Dennett encourages us to reductively translate such experiences into neural processes.  The problem is, that we have experiences without being directly aware of the neural processes that are correlated to them.  That is, what we experience is not a neural process.  We infer the neural process and assume its correlation to what we experience.  Hence, the correlation of a particular neural process to a particular experience is purely speculative or hypothetical -- or at least it's speculative and hypothetical when Dennett doesn't simply present such correlation as a dogmatic belief.  Such dubious correlation calls into question the validity of the Mind's reduction to (or "translation" into) the Body.  If such translation is purely hypothetical or speculative, then Dennett hasn't moved one step beyond Mind-Body dualism (his materialist rhetoric notwithstanding).  Or put it this way.  I have an experience.  Someone may use MRI to try to determine what neural processes occur during my experience.  That person is not going to know the contents of my experience (or mind).  For that, he or she needs to rely on my own immediate or immanent account of my experience.  In other words, the observer of my neural processes simply grafts my own immanent account of consciousness onto those neural processes and assumes their correlation.  Dennett apparently fails to see that such a procedure assumes the immanent validity of a Mind's immediate self-experience (contra materialism) and that he himself relies on this assumption in order to attribute significance to the observed neural processes.    Basically, Dennett tells us that ordinary ideas about the mind or consciousness are naive.  He then proposes to replace our supposedly mistaken ideas with his own naive and question-begging ideas about Mind-Body correlation.  Bottom line: don't waste your time with this book 
 Readers will save themselves much unrewarding labor by disregarding both "Precision and soul" and, I daresay, the highly-touted "Man Without Qualities," reading instead his first work "Young  Torless" and the stories collected under "Five Women."   Musil's derivative philosophical and psychological preoccupations invite  inevitable comparisons with Nietzsche and Freud, both of whose work is  vastly more durable and fruitful.  Despite the powerfully bracing, if not  occasionally repellent, astringency of his style, Musil's work subsequent  to "Five Women" falls considerably short of the enormous and  difficult ambitions which preoccupied his maturity; and, what's more, such  a gaping failure of world-historical pretension tends to pollute enjoyments  one might otherwise have had in reading it.  Read something by one whose  enormous abilities are truly equal to ungodly ambitions -- read Proust 
 I have to say, when we first recieved this 'toy' it was exciting for my son to think of and research the ants.  We ordered the supplies and ants and then waited... they arrived a few weeks later (that was a long, "Are they here yet" experience) and the bonding began.  It was a very fun and exciting time when they arrived and started buliding their little tunnels, my son is 5 and he was enthralled with them, and to be honest I too found it fun to watch and keep track of their building progress etc.  But now for the unfortunate part of this story... my son woke today to find little black ants had invaded the dome through the air holes and wiped out our red ant colony!  It was a VERY sad expereince, I have NEVER seen my son more distraught in his life.  He sobbed and cried for the entire time Mommy was trying to get the little ones out of the enclosure.  When all was said and done there are only 3 big red ants of ours left standing... they are tending to their fallen friends and we are trying to figure out how we can keep that from happening again!  We have never had any indoor ant issues and this took us by surprise indeed.  We live in California, so if your up for the whole ant farm experience please be sure to take into consideration the 'little' ant problem.  Like I said, it was the worst day of my sons life when he found the invaders killing his 'friends'.  My heart is just broken for my son and I too sat and cried with him over the loss... I called the company and asked why the 'skate park' would be designed that other ants could get in and why it did not have a warning in the informational book about that possibility.  They said because, though they have had calls before about this type of thing happening, it does not happen too often.  I wish I had been warned, I could have at least been prepared for that possibility.  Anyway, be aware, because of the food and such for your big ants, it WILL bring little ants and the little ones CAN wipe out the big ones.  It is all very sad for this broken hearted Mom and son 
 I loved the book as a kid and it's too bad they had to ruin it by making such a lame movie out of it. They could have done something much better with the story but instead tried to make it funny to both adults and kids. When will writers learn? Either MAKE IT A GROWNUP MOVIE OR MAKE IT A KIDS MOVIE! It's really hard to do both without kids going "Huh?" and adults going "funny but I can't explain it to the kids." Mike Myers was just UNFUNNY as the cat and his delivery of the jokes was rotten. He's barely funny anyway, (example, Waynes World where Mike is a 40 year old dude playing a teenager..also not funny) why would they put him in this movie? It really comes off like he is trying too hard, it's painful to watch. Jim Carey would have been way funnier as the cat in my opinion. I liked the colorful costumes and houses. Visually it was amazing and captured the look and theme of the book but everything else fell short. The kids acting was pretty good and the ending was funny. It's just too bad they made such a bad choice when casting the Cat. Mike ruined the movie and he was way too over the top. If I never see him 'act' again I would not be upset. The jokes in the movie were way too grown up, kids are smart and sadly a lot of them might actually understand this humor and it sets a bad example. I would not go so far as to say this movie is horrible, it's just not great overall 
 The whole novel should have centralized on Firekeeper's story.  The plot was complicated with ridiculous characters and kingdoms you don't even find out about until three-quarters through the novel.  I kept having to refer back to see how the heck these people were related and who the heck they were.  The beginning of THROUGH WOLF's EYES is wonderful, engrossing,  and exciting.   But once they get to court, you want to dump the book on the nearest coffee table from frustration and boredom. It really, and I mean really, gets nutty talking about a million characters you don't know, can't understand who they are, and don't care a chit about. Get back to the protagonist please!?    The whole war was half-hearted and not compelling at all.  All I cared about as a reader was what was to become of Firekeeper, was the real Lady Blysse really dead, would Holly find out who Firekeeper really is....  and who was Blind Seer really, a royal wolf?  The author NEVER explains that one.   I love dogs of all kinds, I'm 40 years old, and I love good fantasy. Maybe I would have enjoyed this book more had I been an eighteen-year old.  It just seemed the promise the book held remained unfulfilled.  When it ended, I just held it going, "huh.".  That's it? 
 When I first got this charger and started using it I thought it was great.  It did what it was supposed to do.  Why the one star then?  After about two weeks it just stopped working.  It didn't fall or anything.  It died about two weeks after I got it.  I can't really complain though, after all it cost me 5 bucks 
 This disc is quite booty.  Please avoid 
 If you've never read anything about auras, this one would be okay as a primer.  However, there was really nothing new or profound - sorry to say.  My feeling throughout was that the author was trying to make a fast buck by using the Cayce name.  Not worth the 3 or 4 bucks 
 In my never-ending quest for the next comic novel, and spurred on by the plethora of enthusiastic reviews here, I knew I wanted to read "Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom." I imagined that the book was along the lines of something written by Christopher Moore ("The Island of the Sequined Love Nun") or Bill Fitzhugh ("Pest Control"). Alas, I was wrong ...  Twenty-one-year-old Duncan Delaney lives with his mother, Fiona, on the family ranch in Wyoming. Duncan isn't pressed by want, and so he's able to indulge his hobby--painting on black velvet canvas. One day, Duncan's best friend, Arapaho, Benjamin Lonetree sells one of Duncan's paintings for the grand sum of $600. The buyer, an attractive dealer in Los Angeles leaves her business card and expresses great interest in Duncan's talent. So Duncan takes the hint, leaves his high school sweetheart, Tiffany behind (no great hardship), and heads for Hollywood in a tatty old VW bus.   Once in Hollywood, our innocent, country cowboy hero (who sleeps with his Stetson over his face) has a series of adventures ...  Basically, "Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom" is a romance. The novel may be coated with a veneer of the trailer-trash genre, but it boils down to a romance, swaddled with some intrigue, and ne'er do well types. This novel reads better than a Harlequin romance, but with lines such as: "laughing lips that had never felt the needle's collagen sting," and "she was not the swiftest deer in the concrete forest," you should get my point. In all fairness, I should point out that I generally do not read romances, so I was destined to be disappointed in this novel. But for other potential readers, the overwhelming romance aspect of this novel should be mentioned. I did, however, enjoy the character of Benjamin Lonetree. He was an original creation in the novel--displacedhuman 
 While Mr. Livingstone probably has a lot to be angry about, his continual complaining and berating other "assasination researchers" accomplishes nothing more than listening to Hannity & Limbaugh complain and berate "liberals" (although at least some of Livingstone's complaints are grounded in real life).  His earlier works provide a far superior summary of almost every theory out there 
 Fans of the ABC-TV show "LOST" will probably be buying "Our Mutual Friend" in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the "last book [I] ever [read]".  Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.  What a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, 'padded'.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages.   Dickens' work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop', "I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing."  'OMF' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence.   Even worse is the ending.  Some endings just can't help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.  All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for "The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens' oeuvre or are required to read "Our Mutual Friend", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens' far superior works:  'David Copperfield', 'Oliver Twist', 'Pickwick Papers'.    If you are looking for 'LOST' reading material, I would refer you to 'Watership Down' (Excellent), 'The Stand' (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), 'The Dark Tower' series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to 'Our Mutual Friend' possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke, Rousseau and Hume'.

 This album is average at best.  I love American Idol and do get caught up in the talents of each contestant.  I fell for this one and remember , there are reasons that people don't win.  The only reason I wrote this review was that I could not believe all the great reviews I read in this forum.  I guess that Ayla has a lot of friends.  Medicre album.  Don't waste your money 
 Diverges from the main point for about 300 pages.  I kept reading out of hope that I would find out what happened to the map thief.  Only bought the book because it was on clearance - a total waste of a $1.99 
 I picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.  I went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).  Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.  Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.  So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.  Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.  I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.  But you can guess how this ended up.  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  And I never finished the book since it was ruined.  But! I liked the parts I read "okay" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.  Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well.  Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you "keep on keepin on" like they say 
 I enjoyed the first 3 books of the Women's Murder Club. Didn't like too much the 4th (of July), but the 5th is just BAD ! What's the plot ? There is no plot ! 2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner, the 1st mystery (Car Girls) get solved mid-way throught the book and I bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read... By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women's Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. And it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. Not much to save this book, it's even badly written. Don't know if Patterson thinks about writting a 6th, but don't count on me next time  
 If you are reading these in order, this one is anticlimatic! you know that they are going to be together and the back story is horrible.  I really enjoyed the first 3, but the stories are becoming so much the same that I am giving up on this series!  I enjoyed sherrilyn kenyon's series so much more (which is also a little repetitve), but better written.  Christine really needed an editor to get rid of the same old statements over and over again AND to speed up the boo 
 Before taking a 4 hour train trip, I surveyed the pulp novels available at the news-stand.  I didn't want to make the mistake of picking up another book I would have to throw away in disgust 3 days later, like "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" or anything by that man-hating forensic anthropologist, what's-her-name.  So I went with "Bourne Ultimatum" as a safe bet, figuring, since I had seen "Identity" and "Supremacy" in the movie incarnations, and they were pretty good, this would be more of the same.    I was very wrong.  From the first few chapters, it became clear that the book was incoherent, repetitive, and its characters were laughably underdeveloped.  Later, huge holes in the plot began to appear, apparent lapses in reason and knowledge on the part of the author regarding their own material.  These seem to haunt many pulp novels, but nowhere is it more annoying.  Also, the author has the lazy habit of putting a lot of dialogue in italics to show emotion, rather than writing emotional dialogue.    This book has become almost unreadable, so it's going to the curb tomorrow.  I'm quitting on page 263.  I don't like or feel attached to any of the characters, and the plot has become a confusing spiral of contrivances.  I agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this book is a real slog to read; the opposite of a page-turner.  It's sad to see a trilogy that apparently started well, end like this.  You can guess from reading it that Ludlum, if he even wrote it, had no interest in the material, but had a contract to fulfill.              
 I used to have this same unit under the brand name "Emerson Research"  It's a pretty good unit, but it's a very old model.  For the price, you can get a much more modern one from Emerson Research at a local store 
 This 7th Edition was published in 1999, but a good bit of the material seems to date from an earlier era.  Remarks about 35mm photography, for example, refer to a level of technology that prevailed much longer ago.   The photographs (none in color) are very, very dated in style (were they made in East Germany?), and in fact many of them are held over from the 1st edition (1967).   Worse, the pictures are disturbingly bizarre and creepy.   I ripped page 78 out of the book to avoid having to see it again.  This may the most comprehensive work available on the subject, but let's hope the 8th edition is a thorough revision - and please include a few marvelous color landscapes and fine B&W portraits that are the reasons we love the LF format.... and lose those awful distorted photographs of 1950s mannequins.  Luckily, though, a lot of things about view cameras are the same as they have always been, so the basic content of this book remains altogether usable.  
 ...then perhaps all men should read 'A Women's History of the World', now called, I believe, 'Who Cooked the Last Supper...' (for another look at how facts can be cherry-picked, warped to suit any argument, and sweeping generalizations are made from singular statistical data, and correlations are based off presumptive conclusions demonstrating no adequate causation--hmm, only from a woman's point-of-view and a whole lot more unapologetic in tone...I believe Rosalind Miles came from that era of "bitter feminist"--the male-bashing years...   Why I'm even wasting brain-cells on this is beyond me, but what the world didn't need was yet one more book--'The myth of Male power'--(you'd do better to read Joseph Campbell and discover the true beauty of myth and symbolism, and some archetypes of masculinity)--that attempts to present the answer to all men's problems (and women's apparently) rehashed once again by misconstrued statistics, sensationalized news contorted to astound and astonish as opposed to making one think, all fit into a pattern of fallacy so apparent, this could be used as an exemplar for intro to logic texts.  Someone in an earlier review stated how disturbing it is so many readers seem to respond favorably to this work without realizing how simplistic the 'facts' proposed are, taken out of context and construed as 'deep' research. What I find even more disheartening is how easily duped most American readers are into not being able to recognize 'pop'-culture hysteria books when they see them and analyze/critique accordingly.    As a case in point, citing men's suicide rates exceeding women's as they go through adolescence into their 20's and 30's, writing the numbers off as a tirade of 'man-the-victim-of-vicious-masculine-stereotypes-see-how-fragile-we-are-damn-the feminists-who've-made-us-suffer-for-demasculinization". How Sir Warren uses these numbers ignores complex issues of familial, socio-economic, ethnic, racial--along with gender--(and even geography) factors.  This statement is not made in negation of a consistently documented trend of higher rates of suicide amongst men over women--all anyone needs to do is go to the CDC website  http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/suifacts.htm to see that. To say this trend is happening because of feminism's cancerous influence upon the wider arena of modern society however, thus demonstrating the victimization of men, the subsequent hacking-away of the male-coping mechanisms in terms of cognitive and behavioral health demonstrates one of these sweeping generalizations, and a lack of correlation/causation.    As noted from the CDC website, women are three times more likely than men to attempt suicide (though not carry through on it). Thus, the prevalence of suicide ATTEMPTS amongst women v. men (if we're talking victim v. victim here) is higher for women; men happen to carry through with their attempt on the first go as opposed to women.  Did the self-destructive tendency come about as poisoned offspring resulting from feminism's damaging influence to masculine development/mental-health/social identity through adolescence? What about the damage feminism has done to women? After all, I'm 3 times more likely to try and kill myself, because I've obviously been conditioned by my XX chromosome to be manipulative and attention-seeking, and in my journey to evolve into a more self-directed and empowered individual I've suffered a crisis in my feminine identity (assertiveness warring against my more natural tendency toward passivity and submission).  So, where men I guess blow their heads off 4 times more frequently than women, women are 3 times more likely to slit wrists and call 911.  Hmm, I don't know, seems to me masculinity is fairly intact--purpose-driven and determined straight to the finish.   I don't honestly believe the above statement, but can anyone see where this sort of reasoning leads? The broad sweeping blame on one civil rights movement (of which feminism ought to be included) attempting to effect societal progress for a discriminated populace elicits a backlash of accusation, wherein feminism is touted as the reason men have lost their identity, self-confidence, jobs security, social security, effectiveness in combat, desire for combat, now experience role-confusion, etc etc...all  in 21st century America.   Has the male ego become so fragile over the last 50 years that it would allow itself to be debased by such clap-trap argumentation and conclusions as to be found in this book? Are men's identities really so fragile in this country, or in the world, that in trying to reclaim the 'masculine-aura', men must segregate themselves and allow themselves to be defined by one more author espousing post-modernist biological determinism obscured by seeming "deep-research" and profound insight into the male psyche?  If anyone is interested in how the world thinking operated in terms of men and women and gender roles in the era prior to "2nd Wave Feminism", [...] If anyone believes this was a better world, then I invite you to continue looking through rose-colored glasses.   For others, especially Sir Warren Farrell, what is it about feminism that has frightened so many, and disgusted so many others? Not to quote a bumper-sticker, but "feminism is the radical idea that women are people too", doesn't seem to scream femi-nazi.   Indeed, I think one review from "Fire in the Belly" had it right on--if you're looking to reclaim your masculinity, you'd do better to rent a John Wayne movie or watch Gladiator or The 300. Now there are paragons of masculine ethos and heroism--even for women (to enjoy on so many levels).  Ultimately, a purpose driven life isn't defined by gender, nor on self-victimization.   On the other hand, as one of my favorite authors once wrote, "It's only stupid, conventional men who like stupid, conventional women," (ah, G. Bradshaw).    I can only wonder at the kind of history with women a man like Sir Warren Farrell has had since he obviously claims to have the answers as to society's ills with them 
 I bought this book assuming it would give help in dealing with the  alcoholic but was very disappointed.  If you are doing research this book  may be fine, but it is not for self-help 
 I'm not an objectivist, but the idea of a complete philosophical outlook of life and society (including epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics) intrigued me.  This book claims to build an entire philosophy from a starting premise of three axioms.  Unfortunately, while I do find some of the ideas intriguing-- and some truly novel-- the book fails to prove objectivism in a philosophically rational manner.  The book is filled with contradictions, non-sequitars, and assumptions; all these flaws finally accumulate and weaken the arguments made.  Of the issues I had with the book, however, the greatest came from Peikoff's method of writing, and dogmatic preachiness when it came to objectivism. His only tactic to prove his points was to build two straw men (extreme intrinsicism and extreme subjectivism); after doing so, he would easily whack them down, thus showing objectivism to be the only correct option.  The problem is that there aren't only three options, and Peikoff's interpretation of subjectivism and intrinsicism aren't always the most easily defendable.  Peikoff just picks those view that seem ludicrous-- even to subjectivists-- and shows them as the representation of his enemies.  Even when I completely agreed with Peikoff-- for example, when it comes to the uselessness of scepticism-- I found his ready dismissal of some rather complex philosophical issues in the debate nauseating.  Peikoff's redundant use of Ayn Rand's books to make his point also undermine his strategy.  Peikoff sometimes uses Rand's novels to clarify a point of objectivism, but sometimes he uses those novels to prove his point.  The use of literature to make a philosophical argument is absurd, especially when the author of the literature is the creator of the philosophical beliefs.    While I do have misgivings in general about the book, some of the ideas are interesting; unfortunately, I think Peikoff said it best when he assumed anyone reading this book had already read-- and enjoyed-- the Fountainhead.  If you are an objectivist who wishes to find some support for your ideas, you'll find some here-- although not as many as you'd think.  If you aren't an objectivist, or you aren't enamored with Ayn Rand's books, you should probably look elsewhere for a discourse on rationality (I suggest Spinoza or Russell).  Or if you want a better philosophical explanation as to why capitalism is good, look to Nozick, or maybe Milton Freidman.  Objectivism-- at least explained in this book-- fails to measure to the other philosophers I've mentioned 
 But not quite. While I wouldn't say this was a terrible novel, I also wouldn't say that it was in any way memorable. Because of the wonderful dramatization on the audio cassette, I passed an afternoon at work more  pleasantly, being entertained by the acting skills of the readers. However,  if I'd been merely reading a text version of this story, I wouldn't have  finished it because the plot did not interest me enough to deserve my full  attention. The characters are too typical of a mystery novel, the prose  style unremarkable, and the ending not too exciting 
 I hoped to find a great amount of content from this Catholic Priest. I have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of God was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the Lord.  Father Tom accurately describes that guilt issue. However, instead of expressing how he found the Lord to be a forgiving God and that we are in need of accepting His grace, Tom moves into a diatribe of Panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself. If you don't know, Panentheism is a way of explaining that "Everything is in God". At the surface that sounds great. But there is more to it. It also ascribes that God is so intertwined in the creation that he cannot live apart from it. Man. That is a leap...since God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and He was so BEFORE he made the earth.  OK>..so you see. Tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth.  If you want the guilt answer...doooo noooott buy this book. Instead, buy a bible. Holman Press just came out with a great one. Read the first few verses of Romans chapter 8. Then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them. If you want the short answer. Hear it is. "We are not ever going to be good enough. And that is OK. God forgives all of us. Just accept that fact." Don't stop trying though. It helps others see the Good in GOD when they see it. Being good is not for going to heaven. It is to help show others that there is a good God to go to heaven to see! 
 I'm giving up on this book.  It reads like a first draft.  Sentences like the following on page 71 abound: "When you hear not so often as you wish, remember, our silence means our safety," the Committee of Secret Correspondence  - now doing business as the Committee for Foreign Affairs, although Franklin, who had never mastered the original name, was not to know for months - soothed the envoys, whom they understood to be starved for news.      Schiff needed a good editor but didn't get one.  This certainly isn't Pulitzer grade material.  I wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth.      Van Doren in his biography gives a better account of Franklin's years in Paris. 
 but quite often the asides in the book appear to be what is found on the internet.Many of the entries for director and sometimes actors are incorrect. This makes the cross referencing mentioned above useless. 
 Elliott Wave is the least practical approach to Technical Analysis I am aware of.  There are so many exceptions to the rules that govern EW that one can never gain enough confidence in the signal to put money to work. They say that if you get 12 EW practitioners in a room you will get 13 different wave counts. Believe me, there's a lot of truth in that statement! I am amazed that people actually take EW seriously.  There are plenty of very useful books on Technical Analysis, although there aren't very many well written ones.  I recommend any book by John Murphy, and also Trader Vic-Methods of a Wall Street Master which is a tremendous book that will teach you the most important thing to know; how to recognize the trend and when it changes 
 Package missing.  It's never be received.  So I cannot rate it 
 Written on a sophomoric level, this brief biography of Babe centers on the highlights of her life but ignores Babe's life-long emotional roller-coaster. After reading this book, you may think Babe enjoyed her life as an outcast and her distinctive masculine character was merely a promotion gimmick; that her `tomboy' nature disappeared when her sexual identity was questioned. It completely ignores the many questions about her sexual ambiguity and promotes her marriage to George Zaharias as the real thing. If it was a `for real' marriage, why did George promote constant `out-of-town' excursions, rarely joining her, seemingly content to be separated for long time periods? This book is like a biography written about pre-AIDS Rock Hudson or Liberace. It does not examine the real Babe .... a gifted athletic ahead of her time who tried to fit in. Sports probably kept her sane. This book does not tell you who the Babe is or what she was up to; only what she achieved. 
 I don't write synopsis of the book.  I figure you can look above to see what the plot is.  However this book is awful.  It's supposed to be the bridge between Empire and Return.  I hated Xizor and found him to be a boring villian.  There are MAJOR plot holes and gaps in the book that are hard to understand.  The writing of the book looks like an editor wasn't involved.  I love the expanded universe of Star Wars.  I just can't believe George Lucas let this book slip out like this.  I don't recommend this to anyone but the intense fans that need to have the bridge.  There are too many better books in the Star Wars series 
 If you buy this book expecting to find details of Steve Michalik's legendary Intensity,Insanity training....then keep your money in your pocket, you wont find what your looking for in this book. Instead we have a selection of circuit traning routines. The Intensity,Insanity section is restricted to a few pages of repetition schemes, which to be honest you could find anywhere on the internet, no depth,no detail?  For the novice weight trainer this book is over complicated, the experienced trainer will be left frustrated by the lack of real training information and the "padding out" of chapters with disjointed information, seemingly from a variety of different sources. The book is very dissapointing, especially when you consider the status that Michalik has, in this respect I felt misled to read the 5 star review - only to find this person was a technical assistant on the book. I am sure actually training with Steve Michalik is a different ball game altogether, few will get the chance to do that, therefore; people will buy this book in the expectation of finding something which is really exceptional, in my opinion it isnt.    
 Although informative, the author needs almost 400 pages to say what could have easily been said in well under 100 
 tHIS WAS VERY ENJOPYABLE WHEN IT FIRST AIRED ON TELEVISION BUT IS IS DATED AND NOT AS GOOD AS I RECALL FROM 30 YEARS AG 
 Make sure you buy this at a retailer that allows returns if it doesn't work. I bought one last week after a presentation. It looked and worked great at the presentation. I bought it because I had an immediate weekend-long project where I needed correct color. When I set up my new Eye-one/Display 2, all I could get was a "fail" on the emissions test, over and over - and never did get to testing my Mac LCD monitor. No response from the Eye-one "support" to my e-mails.   I brought the gadget back to the store that then told me I had moved it during the test or the screen had gone black - and that was the only reason it failed. Neither of those were true. ...However, I did get a refund. So, beware. I'd like to give it a 4 or 5 on the basis of what I saw the demo do, but for how the one I bought worked, I'd give it a zero. Had the "support" even bothered to respond, I would have tried to work with them rather than doing a return since I really did want it to work. Average the scores for a 2 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 A sorry science fiction book (not a mystery novel in my judgement) not written by Ludlum but his name is on the cover to sell books (my viewpoint). The book takes advantage of todays terrorist threats and smallpox concerns to stir the readers interests but nothing in the book reflected the writings of Ludlum. I strongly suspect that Ludlum did not even write the outline for this book and the sorriest one, "The Paris Option" 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 this is the worst book i have ever read,,it is very dull and unuseful..i9 bought it because i have read about the popularity of the surgeon who wrote it. i wish i can return it and get a refund..but i have threogh it in the tras 
 This book is really reserved for pattern's fans, because material inside is essentially focused on processes patterns, and design materials are expressed in a textual way. Anyway, some ideas are good to be kept aside,  but amount of such ideas don't justify the book size 
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.  The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.  The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.  I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.  The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly?  If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.  Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.  Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.   I'm not counting on that, though 
 This book lacks any information about education. Such an essential subject - affecting children and adults alike - should certainly be included.  Nor does it include information about art (visual/performing) or literature pertinent to the people at the time.   It also has no index, so that searching for anything is ridiculously slow.  Visuals are lacking - textual descriptions of hair or various equipment are poor substitutes for an image.  Essentially it is a poorly organized dictionary, and stating that it is "a guide for writers, students and historians" is an overstatement to say the least!  
 David Von Drehle had it right, the Triangle Fire is one of the great American tragedies and a great story. But Drehle takes an almost scientific approach to a story about people. Padding out the book to make it novel length (The appendix is nearly 1/3 of the page length) he so often repeats himself and circles back on the same information, over and over and over again.  Detail in such a tale is good, but Drehle is so caught up with just how many sewing machines are on each table he loses sight of WHY this story is so compelling.  The actual story of the fire is retold no less than nine times from nine different perspectives. And any time the book advances Drehle yanks it back to circle back on itself. Drehle might be a good archivist but he's a poor novelist.   I grew up on tales of the Triangle fire as my great grandfather was one of the men who went up to the roof to escape the fire and his stories were always rivetting...Drehle's aren't. DO NOT Recommend this book. It's a huge disappointment! 
 I dont know about any review I want to be able to listen to the song befor I rate it Im not realy sure if that is the right song im thinking about if  you or some one can tell me where i can listen to the song to see if it is realy the song that i am looking fo 
 I think Dr. Laura should title her next book "The Secret of My Success: Stupid People."   Julie Townsend, Metairie, L 
 Full of beautiful pictures and containing much helpful information, one would think that this book is the perfect resource for home gardening enthusiasts and hydrangea lovers.  However, the most important information for gardeners without a degree in horticulture is the USDA Hardiness zone.  In my opinion, without this information, the book is useless.  I had high hopes that this book would contain it all; I was sorely disappointed.   Keep searching unless you just want to add one more hydrangea book to your collection 
 Since all other reviews are very positive, I'm here to offer a different opinion.  I've had this book for over a year now, and I barely use it. Each time I attempt to find something useful in it, the information is scattered over the entire book making it extremely difficult to understand.  For example, right now I'm looking up the "ref" attribute, and according to the index, it appears on 7 different locations throughout the book, each portion shorter than 1 page. Also, I have seen many tables scattered throughout with exact same information, or one or two differing field values, making it very confusing to understand which table is doing what.  And at over 500 pages long, there is a large amount of filler information in this book.  Is this book "definitive"? It looks like it is. Is this book usable? Absolutely not. This is one of the worst investments I've made in computer books.  And there is a place about strings in the book where it differs from the official W3C specs 
 This book has a fairly annoying layout which refers back to information not previously mentioned.  The examples are also fairly overly complex, there are much simpler ways to solving the problems.  Regardless, it was a required book 
 The authors try to illustrate the materials as clearly as they can, they likely to speak the same things "in other words" to prevent the readers to misunderstand the contents; it is good, but they should write the text more simplify, do not use a lot of words and sentences to introduce the same idea. For example, they use one chaper to explan a simple formula, and through whole book, you can find many pages contains a lot of words, but just one or two sentences of them is the improtant notion you want to know. I suggest the authors should think about non-native readers, try to use little words to write the book. Do not speak one thing again and again, like gossip women. The advantages of this book is it contains many tables and pictures, it let users easy to undersatanding the materials.    
 There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked this book up on the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there 
 240 pages of scratchy toilet paper. Shaughnessy is allowed to perpetuate a myth based not in fact, but his own feeble brain. Avoid this book at all costs 
 This book is filled with attempts to create religious symbolism where there simply isn't any. I personally find it inappropriate and irresponsible (among other things) to teach a child that the red in a candy represents the blood of Christ. First (and most importantly), it just plain isn't true. Second, it introduces difficult theological issues that the age range for this book is not ready to understand. Last, "the blood that Jesus shed for us" has absolutely nothing to do with Christmas (it is, however, part of the Easter story).   This "history" has no base in reality. It is an urban myth that has been perpetuated by the internet. By publishing the story, it is given momentum once again to be believed by unsuspecting people and, more importantly, by innocent children. This story is not the truth - it isn't even an accepted traditional story - and it should not be represented as such.   There are so many wonderful stories, histories and projects children can study about Christmas without trying to manipulate or misrepresent the tenements of Christian faith. In addition, there is a traditional (and much more likely) story of the candy cane that parents can tell. But, this particular story in no way furthers the understanding of Christianity and, to be honest, I'd be embarrassed if people thought as a Christian I believed it 
 This novel was required for an English Writing class, and I must say that the novel serves no practical purpose what-so-ever.   By the novels end I was left wondering to what intention the author had in mind, but more-so to what reason did readers have to keep reading?  Life is short and time is valuable, and so I only choose to read novels in which something can be gained. Okay, life is not always fair, yet the show must go on...got it.  But this novel's all-too-obvious moral comes at a painfully high price; one must leave their common sense on page nineteen, only to find the storyline to be too dark, too dramatic, and a tad too driven by blind faith.   The absurd storyline is only surpassed by the countless missed opportunities to offer readers something real, something tangible, something useful.  Basically anybody can write a piece of nonsensical overkill, but who has the want or the time to read it? So Far From God, more like So Far From Good 
 I've had cancer (and recurrances) for 7 years, and I've read every book on every aspect of the subject, and this book is the absolute worst I've yet to come across.  LeShan writes a weird mixture of vintage voodoo and goofy "new-age" hype.  LeShan's lethal psychobabble can be literally deadly as he lures frightened, newly-diagnosed cancer patients into drinking oceans of green tea while while scaring them away from conventional, proven treatment.  Avoid this book, and the others like it, unless you want a good laugh.  
 After posting a so-so 3-star review of the first book in this series "Babylon Rising," I really hoped that "The Secret on Ararat" would show the author's ability to better develop the lead characters a bit further and to make Dr. Murphy in particular a stronger, cool character. It didn't. If anything, Dr. Murphy showed on several occasions a recklessness that put his team in danger.  Predictably enough, Secret on Ararat picked up where Babylon Rising left off. And the story of finding Noah's Ark definitely piqued my interest. But within about 30 pages the author blew it. I mentioned in my previous review that Lahaye had a tendency to get a bit preachy, but this book takes that to the extreme.   No less than two-thirds of the book involves Dr. Murphy giving lectures (both figuratively and literally) to various people he encounters about Christianity, his love for Christ, and why we should take the Bible as fact. Regardless of my own personal beliefs, I didn't appreciate Lahaye's attempts to shove it down my throat.  The bottom line is I picked up the book for the subject matter and because I was hoping for a rousing, fast-paced biblical adventure. Well, there is some of that, but only a small portion of the book and mainly in the last few chapters. I was thoroughly disappointed with this sequel. 
 Looking for a trend following system? You won't find one in this book.  Developing one and need some assistance?  No help here either.  The critical areas of system development are not covered (What to buy or sell, How much to buy or sell, When to buy or sell, When to get out of a losing position, and When to get out of a winning position).  This book contains a shallow analysis of successful trend followers and their techniques 
 I bought four of these and returned them immediately. Two were dead out of the box. A third had horrible sound.  After searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products I finally settled on the 900 Megahertz Wireless Intercom from Radio Shack. (43-3102)  Beautiful sound. Well made and about half the price of the Reporter. Pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet. So if you need more than 300 feet for range it's something to consider. Better warranty than the Reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year.  Anyway I couldn't be happier with the RS intercom. I just can't recommend the Reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty 
 I have read most of the books in this series and they all suffer from the same problems. They are full of errors that could have been corrected before release if the publisher hired a proofreader. This book is especially frustrating with poor graphics, charts, and tables. You can find some corrections to the text if you search the web. Do not purchase components from the source listed in the book (they are extremely overpriced) 
 I have been very disappointed in this 5th Cape Light Novel. It is slow and boring. I am usually a VERY fast reader but it has taken me 4 weeks and I am still not finished with this one! I loved the first 4 books in this series but I think it is time  to finish the series and be done with it. James is not a very interesting character and NOT hero material. While I have been wondering at Leigh's past, there hasn't been enough mystery to capture my attention for very long. Emily and Dan's marriage plans are boring also. About the only interesting thing that has happened yet is Jessica and Sam's child issues. I have found myself skipping parts and that says a lot for this book. Overall, the first 4 books in this series deserve 5 stars and this one....well...you should quit while you're ahead. 
 It was not at all what I thought it was going to be.  I heard teh song from the Matrix soundtrack and thought this would me more of the same.  Sadly mistaken 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 There may be a point about many college professors being liberal and not conservative, likewise there are legitimate arguments about things like affirmative action,  but like most liberal-bashing books this goes way overboard into the hysterical, such as using the term "brainwashing." GOPists are mad because universities haven't capitulated to them like the mainstream media, and that they still question them and teach things that are true without afterwards "balancing" them out with right-wing nonsense. If they had their way, universities would be "fox"-icized, further contributing to the intellectual decline of America.  If you want brainwashing, just turn on Fox News. In colleges, you're free to believe whatever you like, there are even conservative clubs on campuses. Just because professors usually are liberal (as are most intellectuals) doesn't equate with "brainwashing." And it's funny, I know many people who are Republican who've completed college, I guess their supposed "indocrination" doesn't work that well after all.   If college professors usually hold liberal views (most extremely smart, educated people do), it's not because there's any sort of conspiracy, but because conservative views are often anti-intellectual and put ideology over facts and reality. Many modern conservatives want creationism taught as a valid theory alongside evolution, dismiss real science supporting things they don't find convenient (such as global warming), view dissenting opinions with contempt, and generally hate intellectuals and thinking, educated people ("liberal elites"). If one view makes more sense, and the other is incompatible with academia, it's not the fault of the universities.   I guess if conservatives and Republicans want their views to be taken seriously among academia, they'll have to make it more intellectual and be able to change aspects of their beliefs when they turn out to be completely wrong and unsupported by evidence. They could start by admitting there aren't WMDs in Iraq after all, evolution and global warming are supported by science, and agree that people who disagree with them aren't necessarily evil, pushing a sinister conspiracy, or unpatriotic. It wouldn't hurt to stop hating or at least insulting intellectuals, admitting that maybe people who are experts in a certain topic know more than they do about it. As long as they consider Ann Coulter a cutting-edge thinker, they won't be taken seriously 
 Choose your attitude, Play, Make their day and be present.  There I saved you the 2 hours it takes to read this book 
 I give this book 2 stars because I did find it entertaining to read. It was not one of those boring books that I have to struggle to finish. I liked that it was set very close to where I live and I knew a lot of places mentioned. I also admired that the author tried to understand the mind of a young woman- a man writing from a female viewpoint seems to be rare.  The ending was disappointing, because it seemed kind of canned. All of the sudden everyones families are reconciled, everyone gets off drugs, etc. Tracy gets back with her first boyfriend, who seems to be a gigantic loser, and it's written like it's good. But what really irritated me about the ending was all the racism. Here is my summary: Tracy lives in the ghetto, makes it her goal to be the coolest, uses guys for status, trades sex for bling, realizes there's more to life, then suddenly she becomes enlightened once she becomes proud to be African-American. That's just great, except in this book, being proud of being African-American basically means hating white people and blaming them for everything. It would be understandable if there were even some white characters in the book that mistreated her or her friends, but being that there were virtually no white characters at all, this seems ridiculous and a cheap shot.  Among many other racist comments, she said something about how Africans invented things like vegetarianism and were civilized "while white people were still clubbing each other over the head." Imagine if a white author wrote something like that about blacks. They would be labeled racist and never hear the end of it.  Omar Tyree is hypocritical if he is going to complain of white racism and yet have so many comments like that. (Maybe the characters don't reflect his views, but since so many characters said them, I'm pretty sure they are his views.) He should get over his racial issues. A lot of young people have read this book and adore it, so think of what kind of message this gives them 
 Fantastically irrational, false, warped, and harmful in almost every way and on every level 
 It did the job til it became defective.  After a year of light use (avg 3 times a week), three of the most important buttons stopped working: the start button, power level button and minute plus button.  Now the only way we can get it to heat anything is to use the popcorn button.   
 "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" is a history of that villain we all love to hate from the L. Frank Baum children's classic, The Wizard of Oz. I hate to write a completely negative review, so I'll start with something good. I finished it. Even that is not saying so much, since I rarely abandon a book in mid-read.  My most lasting impression of Wicked is that it just doesn't fit with the characters as I know them. In this book the Wizard is a corrupt tyrant; the Wicked Witch of the East is an (admittedly disliked) political leader and religious influence in Munchkinland; Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, cares more about fashion and society than true good works; and the central character, the Wicked Witch of the West, is not really wicked, nor is she technically even a witch, though she is still decidedly green. The lengthy philosophical discussions of politics, religion, animal rights, the nature of evil, and the presence or absence of souls felt empty and out of place with the colorful and imaginative Oz I love. Here, Oz seems dreary and unrecognizable. I don't dislike philosophy, but I missed the fantasy. In author Gregory Maguire's telling, life in Oz is bleak.  I had hoped this book would give me a new appreciation for why the witch (named Elphaba--a take on L. Frank Baum's initials) is the way she is. What I got instead was a mostly uninteresting character whose story went nowhere. I admire the attempt to humanize a villainess, but presenting her as a (somewhat) complex and (somewhat) sympathetic character makes her actions against Dorothy, not all of which are documented here, so much the less believable. Sometimes the villain just needs to be a villain! Confusingly, Maguire has taken too many liberties with the original The Wizard of Oz, ignoring some key scenes and reinventing others to suit his purposes.  It's nearly impossible to separate this book from its roots in the work upon which it purports to be based, but even as a stand-alone novel, it fails. Maguire hints at ideas and plot points that either never come together or are completely abandoned. The bottom line is that I love books I can't put down. This one put me to sleep. Literally. I finished it, but only because I really wanted to like it and hoped for some redeeming conclusion. It simply did not live up to the potential of its intriguing premise 
 The film looks good. That cannot be denied. It looks stylish and is directed with flair. Unfortunately, the script plays out like it's the product of an immature adolecent personality who needs to get out more and mix with other kids his own age. The dialogue is just cringeworthy.  One cannot help but think that someone indulged Tarantino based on previous successes in funding this project - indulged him to the point of allowing him to act in it - and made a big boob on all counts.  I scare easy but this vampire horror movie with all its (much trumpeted) blood and guts didn't produce a single goosebump. It was like watching a cartoon.  Disappointing.       
 I listened to the unabridged version on tape.  I enjoy audio books because I'm able to work at the same time (I paint).  So I get to feed my desire for great fiction, and get my work done at the same time.    Blair Brown did an incredible job as a narrator. She was able to create a unique "voice" for each character in the story,making  it easy for the reader to keep track of all of the characters from the get go.  However, by the time I got to the end of the tape, I was glad that I at least had painted those six hours instead of wasting my time reading this novel!  I was so disappointed at the end, and found myself really irritated by the main character about three quarters of the way into the story. From the beginning of the story, I was irritated by the character's daughters too.  Also, I was irritated that nothing outwardly seemed to change in Rebecca's life.  OK, she had an arc, but it was all in her head. I found it very unfullfilling.  If I hadn't been passively listening to the story, while doing something else, I probably wouldn't have finished the novel 
 This book sat on my bookshelf for a couple of years, and I finally decided to get to it last week. I should have left it where it was. Although it gives you a decent overview of Chess and its artists, it reads like a dry listing of every recording session and every song that Chess ever did - most of which are of absolutely zero importance, and which nobody cares about. When it does mention a little tidbit that might be more interesting, it is usually given a sentence, maybe two if you're lucky. Furthermore, the author jumps all over the place for each topic; he goes back and forth between decades at the drop of a hat - and the company wasn't around that long. The writing is extremely sloppy, and uses odd punctuation and structure. I think that this may just be a British style of writing (the author is from London, according to the jacket). Whatever it is, it is really irritating for an American to read. If you've never read anything by a British writer, and you plan to read this book, prepare to be annoyed. The book would have been served better if it had been re-edited for publication in America. Also, I'll mention that the author puts WAY too much emphasis on how Chess did in Britain. I acknowledge that Britain played an important part in the revitalization of blues music in the 1960's, but really, does anybody care how The Dells sold in the UK? In general, by the writing and the content, it seems that the book was written by a British fan, one who likes the music, but doesn't have much of a clue of where it came from or why 
 Standard Heinlein Disclaimer: Heinlein is a frequently-polarizing figure in American literature. The people who dislike his work (e.g., A. Panshin) seem to *really* dislike his work, and often for reasons that seem to me spurious. The people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of Heinlein's problems as a writer. I like Heinlein's work quite a bit, and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable, but I would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the "best of the SF genre." They are for me, however, always enjoyable, and that is no small thing to find in an author.   And as you may have guessed, this is one of the two.  (The other is "Rocketship Galileo" which, in my opinion, only suffers from the mistakes of a person new to writing novels, and a hoary "Nazis on the Moon!" plotline that, to put it mildly, has not worn well with time.)  The story behind this book is, apparently, that Heinlein was ill as he was finishing it, and it was published without the traditional editing cycle that he usually employed.  Could be.  Frankly, it's hard for me to imagine editing making this novel more readable.  This is a relatively interesting idea (a man's brain transplanted into a woman's body), but as many others have pointed out, the execution is poor.  Frankly, there's not much story here at all, aside from a man exploring what it's like being in a woman's body.  But the exploration is by turns dull and absurd.  Man in woman's body has many sexual flings!  Man in woman's body poses nude for a painter!  Man in woman's body cooks dinner for widower husband!  Man in woman's body finds that piano lessons he took as a boy are now useless, but he can run secretarial equipment!  The thrills never stop.  There are any number of other irritating things about this book (personally, I find being forced to try to pronounce "Joan" as "Joanne" really irritating, but that's probably just me [If you want it pronounced "Joanne", spell it that way, Bob!]), but I'll let you read the other reviews.  The summation is, for this lover of Heinlein, who has read almost everything he wrote, I can't reread this novel.  And for me, folks, that's really saying something 
  I can't believe than anyone would write or publish such slander against major religions, some of which are thousands of years old, which teach peace, love, equality and compassion. The book is full of mis-representation and the author has a total lack of understanding the nature of spirituality. There is enough hate in the world without this book.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one! 
 Just out of curiosity it may be worth skimming through its pages, but the way Mr Baird used to trade in the past (with sheets to get ur position from) is far away from how this is done today. Hence, do not surprise yourself if discussions such as smile delta and smile gamma do not come into play. 
 First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc.   I bought this book with 2 other books "The superhero book" (visible ink production) and "comic book encyclopedia" (ron goulart) and none of them satisfied me.   However "comic book encyclopedia" (ron goulart)is the only one which provides all superheroes with "pictures" other books doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones.   i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics 
 Not one of Cary Grant's better ones.  Too goofy and it didn't look as if he enjoyed the part 
 This is one of the most tediously judgmental biographies I've read in a long, long time. D. J. Taylor spends most of his time correcting or chiding or simply doubting Orwell. He sifts through "Such, Such Were the Joys" determined to prove that Orwell exaggerated how unhappy he was in school. He defends the families that Orwell characterized in ROAD TO WIGAN PIER as if this were a legal brief and not some of the most vivid prose in English literature. He discusses the great essay "Shooting an Elephant" solely in terms of whether it's literally true or not. And so on. Asking a few questions of the material is one thing, but Taylor grinds on and on and on.   He is so determined not to let Orwell get away with anything that this book never achieves any dramatic or narrative momentum. The only bits of life are the short snapshot chapters that describe Orwell's voice, say, or his face. And Taylor flubs long stretches of the story. His pages on the background to the Spanish Civil War and the factional fighting in Barcelona are total gibberish. I had to pull out a couple of other books to find out what exactly was going on. It was at this point I decided to stop reading.  For all their faults, the Bernard Crick, Stansky/Abraham, and even the Michael Shelden are better, more readable biographes. 
 Despite translating thousands of worthless Latin quotations, the editor of this edition leaves large passages from the section on Love Melancholy, which Burton waggishly wrote in Latin, untranslated. Burton demands enough of one's patience; one shouldn't have to put up with this sort of nonsense from his editor, even if one's Latin is good. After plodding through over a thousand pages, the reader has earned a little titillating trivia. Also, if you've forgotten your Latin, Burton's notes are left untranslated. Finally, I'll say that although Burton is amusing, the book is too long with too little content. Go back to his sources, read Swift, read Marcus Aurelius, read Kierkegaard on religious despair; and then, if you have time, read Burton-- or skim him 
 This is a typical drug store mystery set in the mountains of North Carolina with an improbable plot, almost no character development, sophomoric writing, and an Indian tribe who turn out to be descendants of slaves owned by an Indian tribe.  The only redeeming virtue of the book is  a use of herbal medicine within the plot.  It contains its own bromide, so  to speak. Don't waste your time and money 
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 The plot was very good, but I could not tell who was talking and who was being talked to during most of the book.  As an avid reader, I was looking forward to reading an easy-to-read, entertaining book before getting back to something heavier.  Boy was I wrong - I am not accustomed to so much dialogue confusion.  The book was poorly written and I do not recommend it to anyone. 
 The debate over the importance of participatory democracy is interesting, but does it really need to be debated in a 200+ page book?   Sometimes Polletta provides some interesting history on various social movements tried to be collectivist, but most of her book is generalized, esoteric rambling. Somehow some sociologist with graduate degrees feel entitled to write long boring, theoretical pieces like this. This book offers no new insight and will be forgotten. Jo Freeman wrote a short article (about 20 pages) on the same subject and it was much better than this. 
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 E.P. Sanders makes quite a few compelling and controversial arguments in this book.  It has been hailed by many as a great work despite its brevity and I can see why, since it brings a lot of new insight on a pillar of the Christian church.  His thesis: Paul is convinced he has received a message of salvation for humankind through Christ - this message frees us from the law and Paul is willing to use Scripture in flexible ways to validate that message and his own authority to proclaim it. What specifically sets Sanders opinion apart is that he believes Paul's mission has much more to do with Paul's belief in himself and his message and much less to do with what Paul actually can pull from Scripture.  In other words, Paul has an agenda that seems to go beyond just proclamation of God's Word and into proclamation of Paul's authority and the importance of validating his own mission (and conversion).   As a Pharisee, Paul's education in Scripture was paralleled by few.  He was a walking Scriptural lexicon.  E.P. Sander's argues that Paul used his mastery of Scripture to his advantage.  He used `proof texts' from Scripture in order to prove his argument without regard to the original meaning of the passage.  Paul was "not concerned with the meaning of the biblical passages in their own ancient context" (page 66).   Does this sound like the author who has a high view of Paul or Scripture?  Is this the man you want teaching you about Paul?  Not me, thus the 2 stars.  I give it 2 stars because it's nice to see the "New Perspective on Paul" in all of it's glory and in E.P. Sanders' case, that "New Perspective" means a lower view of Scripture and a higher view of himself. 
 I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from.   
 After anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book, it was so disappointing to realize that I was forcing myself to read it!  The book reads like a term paper with so many quotes from PG's own book that I was wondering why I had not bought that one instead.  Several friends have also attempted to read this book and just can't get past the first half.  You have to be dedicated and determined to get through this one 
 I tried really hard to like this book, but I found it just a poor rehash of information already put forward by William Sutherland D.O, the father of Cranial Osteopathy and John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., the developer of CranioSacral Therapy.  For a true Visionary approach to "CranioSacral" work, you should consult the works of Sutherland and Upledger 
 Your description of the Popover Pan did not did not contain "MINI".  The item I wanted was the standard size popover pan, not the mini.  "MINI" should be added to your description 
 This is possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The writing and acting, as far as I am concerned, are no better than that of a middle school live performance. The only reason I didn't turn it off was that I was hoping SOMETHING in the movie might help me justify spending $10 to buy it used. That something never came. I would never waste my time on this movie when there are others on this topic that so richly deserve my viewing time investment, such as "Schindler's List" & "The Pianist". Trust me, PASS IT UP just as fast as you can 
 I found the product highly unsafe as a stroller. The handle is very flimsy, and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller. Also the wheels do not lock properly and safely. Its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve 
 Increasingly, examination of our past reveals that there once was a Golden Age of mankind. Did its origins lay in some fantastic acount of ancient spaceports and alien intervention, or did man, by himself, achieve great things in his remote past? Sitchin opts for the fantastic, and reviewer Paul Stets writes, "It is not important whether Sitchin's writings are true...  (Sitchin) creates an illusion of scientific research." Is illusion or entertainment enough? To many of us truth matters. 
 I was disappointed by this toothbrush holder after putting it to use for just one day - any drops of water that run down the side of the holder or end up around the bottom edge due to splashing/runoff from the bathroom sink immediately seem to trigger the bottom of the holder to rust! I tried to keep the splashing to a minimum but this thing started leaving a rust-ring on my bathroom counter within a couple days. I still use it since it's a nice-looking & easily cleaned toothbrush holder but I keep a coaster under it to protect the sink/counter. I wish I could give it more stars since I love the look & functionality of it but I have to give it only 2 stars since I think making it rust-proof is only common sense for something that sits next to your sink. I wonder if all the steeltek "stainless-steel" products rust so easily?? 
 Although this book is a detailed, if overintellectualised, account of the Sex Pistols' short career and the ludicrous media games of Malcolm McLaren and Glitterbest, It is not by any stretch of the imagination, a book on U.K. Punk. It completely bypasses England's second generation of Punk (1981-1983)out of which sprang many of the Greatest Punk Bands Of All, such as The Exploited, Discharge, Vice Squad, Chaotic Dischord ,Disorder, The Anti-Nowhere League, Chaos U.K., G.B.H., and The Insane! None of these bands are even briefly mentioned in this book! It's As If Jon Savage,poncey journalist that he is, is afraid to acknowledge their existence! Instead he wastes page after agonizing page reading overblown hippie-like ideas into the useless New Wave bands he erroneously believes to be punk! The one or two lines about Crass don't even begin to make up for this pompous smokescreen. Worthless, Stalinist tripe!!!! Save your money and save yourself a headache! DO NOT BUY THIS!!! 
 the title pretty much says it all. read blackhawk down instead.. 
 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 50 cent is one of the worst rappers to hit a recording studio almost as bad as Webbie. I see some people wrote "I bet people did not even listen to the album they just heard the singles and thought it was soft". Well i listened to the whole album and my IQ dropped 83 points it was that retarded of an album. The only reason this sells is because white people think their cool when blasting this in their vehicles. I will never purchase a G Unit affiliated album ever again even if I like the artist because I know 50 will be on it. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! 
 I read most of the book last night and was disturbed by several things - The author deliberately blurs the line between "Arab" and "Muslim." He calls non-Arabs "whites," and makes whites sound like low class, trailer trash, uneducated red necks. Aren't Arabs white? I was offended that he mentioned Danny Thomas as an example of all the fine Arab people who have come to US to find a better life. Yes, Danny Thomas was Arab, but not a Muslim. Maharidge quotes an Arab comedian as saying that there's so much discrimination against Arabs. But unless they point out that they are an Arab, how would one even know? How can you treat someone different, unless they point out how different they are?   I have personal involvement in two of the stories quoted in the book, and know that facts presented are incorrect. I think it's grossly incompetent and irresponsible for an author to present a work of nonfiction without verifying his information.  Knowing that some of the facts are wrong, I would look at the rest of the book with reservation. Maharidge treats those he perceives to be the underdog with sympathy, but paints those who speak against them as ignorant, uneducated bigots.  Maharidge's premise that contemporary America dangerously resembles the Weimar Republic, or "Heimat," that led to Nazi Germany is an oversimplification of the current government of the US.  This proposition is deliberately anti-administration, inflamatory, and a grab for publicity. 
 This book is based on on the opinion of the author and a few male "experts".  He bases his observations about women on his survey of a small group of church women who appear to represent the traditional role of the submissive stay at home wife and mother.  He never gives any other background of who these women are.  Dobson needs to wake up and realize that the traditional role of stay at home housewife is "history", even if the wife has chosen to stay at home and care for children.  Unless you are married with "traditional" roles you will likely be turned off by this book. I was. Some of Dobson's references in this book are so weak, as he seeks to show how men and women are so different from each other.  I believe that he has joined in the destuctive practice of seeking to look for how men and women are different rather than looking at our mutual needs like respect, emotional support, communication and loyalty. I gave this book one star because there are some parts that are interesting, it's just a shame that Dobson put this book out with the title it has.  Women and men should read this book with a very critical mind, if at all 
 Understand, I love Springsteen.  Born to Run is my second favorite album of all time.  I have seen him live over a dozen times.  I personally think he is the single most important American rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to Elvis, Chuck Berry and Dylan).  I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this album is unlistenable.    Some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful.  That's rubbish.  There is a complete absence of melody on this record, as was the case with much of The Ghost of Tom Joad album (with a huge exception being "Youngstown" - a great song).  The apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like Woody Guthrie or Jimmy Rodgers is just frightening.  Dylan could pull it off, Bruce just disappoints.  But it's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure.  Believe, I listened to Devil & Dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what I am apparently missing.  I couldn't. I thought The Rising was a nice album.  I even liked the Devils & Dust solo tour (Bruce is a powerful performer, and maybe even more commading when it's just him on stage), but I doubt this CD will ever find its way back into the player 
 I was a big time Stones fan in the 60's.  Just listened to the CD of Flowers and now I realize it stinks. We went from down and dirty, toe tapping stuff like Satisfaction, Can I Get A Witness, I Use TO Love Her and  Little Red Rooster to such violen, over produced crap as  My Girl, Sweet Lady Jane, Back Street girl. The Bee Gees sang better stuff. It was all for the money. Write your own songs and you do not have to share it with any one. Starting with Aftermath the Rolling Stones became the Mick and Kieth show with various back up. No wonder Brian went crazy. And they all knew it. The worse the songs got the more they depended on big stage productions with Mick wearing lipstick and jumping around like a frog. If anyone wants this CD and the LP let me know at Trishdubois@mac.com and it's yours. God help you 
 This title is billed as the Sixth Edition, and reflects the coming and going of co-authors.  It is too bad that the editor had so little influence. Sections of this book that stick to their cartographic knitting are excellent.  Historical information is very intersting.  Basic explanations, such as the evolution of ellipsoids is very well done. Some  of the writing is so bad it could have been extracted from a sophmore term  paper, sprinkled with such inept phrases as "such as",  "similarly", "however" and "in fact". The  most glaring deficiency is in the area of computer technology.  Either this  material has not been updated since some earlier edition, or the author(s)  are very uncomfortable with the subject matter.   As examples: "Most  common procedures used by cartographers have been translated into software  programs written in special computer languages such as FORTRAN and C."  "Today's well-rounded cartographer is routinely involved with these  'canned' (prewritten) mapping programs..." "The professionsal  cartographer should, therefor, have a working knowledge of at least one  computer language."   We are regaled with three pages of detailed  obselescent material on computer structure, but only 23 lines of overview  on current instrument technology.   There is a whole chapter on fonts and  lettering, but no algorithm for conversion from Lat-Long to UTM. The  central meridians for the UTM zones are not provided, nor is the DoD  lettering scheme. One of the responsibilities of a text book is to arrange  the subject matter in a structure where it can be easily referenced.  This  book reads like a series of articles of varying quality published under one  cover, with overlap resolution left as an exercise for the reader 
 This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played.   "Eight Women" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. "Eight Women" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.  Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.  By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience. 
 A densely packed book with many bits of interesting information but terribly organized and loaded with names, places, institutions not properly identified that are complete blanks to a non-English historian.  A great disappointment 
 Sure, the plot lines are more than a little strange, and I do not mean strange in a good way, but has no one else noticed how unbelievably CLUMSY this book is? I kept reading because one of the plot lines (the more serious one--with the bald fugitive) dragged me along. But it was doggone hard to deal with the style. Maybe I should say lack of style, unless a surfeit of exclamation points counts as "style." I've read Wambaugh's nonfiction in the past, and I've never found it to be particularly ineptly written. Maybe I stumbled on books he spent some time polishing, I dunno. But this book is a wreck. There isn't a graceful descriptive sentence in it, and the dialogue is almost unbearable. Even if it had been well-written, it would be pretty hard to enjoy a book where the dog is the only truly appealing character 
 Hey everyone! Lookit me!  I'm a rich little snot and I can throw a big party in my mansion!  What's "great" about this Gabsty fellow exactly?  Write something about people who work for a living, not this junk.  I didn't like this one little bit, sorry.  Try again.  Only one star for your book, sir 
 I found this book very disappointing. I already own Dr. Atkins book and there isn't really any difference in the actual diet. The information on hormone therapy was interesting, but most of the information regarding recommended brands and doses of estrogen was available on the authors web site. If, like me, you have allergies to dairy products, eggs, or nuts, the companion book, "Mini-Meal Cookbook", is a waste of money 
 If you are into the old childrens songs from the 50's, 60's, and 70's (you know the ones: they were played by your kindergarten teacher on a record player)- then this set of 4 disks are for you. Personally, I was hoping for something a little more modern. These all sound like they were recorded directly from a 45LP. Not the highest quality 
 Mindmapping is easily a five star topic.  It is a powerful way to visually show the structure of thoughts and of human memory.  I'm an IT guy like one of the previous reviewers below, and I can vouch for mindmapping working wonders.  Tony Buzan, who (I believe) invented it and has written much better books on the topic is some kind of genius.  This book, unfortunately, contains few examples of how to construct mindmaps.  And those examples and explanations are poor quality.  The very few diagrams are of very low monochrome stick figure quality - whereas the whole idea behind mind-mapping is to create a multi-color visual extravaganza to nurture visual thinking and the production of ideas.  The paper it is printed on feels like the cheapest newsprint they could buy.  It is not in color like Buzan's five star 1996 "Mind Map Book: How to Use Radiant Thinking to Maximize Your Brain's Untapped Potential".  It basically is an attempt to ride the coat-tails of a successful book on a hot topic by pulling in all those people who buy all the books they can find on a hot topic like mindmapping who want to get "as broad a perspective" on the topic as they can.  It rambles wildly page after page and in a totally unfocused series of scatter-brained essays about theories of creativity, how to write, how to conduct meetings, and etc that are potentially applications for mindmapping.  The problem is that the execution of these chapters is horrible, and they don't really tie in mind-mapping into their unfocused thesis.  After reading each of these chapters, the reader is left to their own devices to try to imagine how to apply mind-mapping to the applications listed.  Two thirds of this book can be condensed down to one page listing the potenital applications and saying "I think you can figure out how to apply mindmapping to each of those".  One possible merit of the book is the short chapter on how to use mind-maps in place of "to-do" lists.  This 7 page chapter is the only well executed element of the entire book.  For some buyers out there, this chapter will be worth more than the cost of the book.  ...but from the standpoint of most readers needs, it is not good enough to warrant adding an additional star to my review score.  The meat of the book is chapter 3, about 15 pages.  It tells the "basic techniques" of mindmapping and leaves out vast elements found in Buzan's instruction.  More than half of that chapter is filler.  I should point out that there are many detractors to the whole idea of mind-mapping.  It works for some people, like myself, who are very visually oriented.  ....The method of mind-mapping outlined in this book simply doesn't work at all....  Real mind-mapping that works is full of clear pictures drawn by the artist/author/creator that are designed to summon up complex memories in the person who created the mind-map - visual cues to complex ideas stored visually.  There is no real discussion of how to use pictures in this book - the very few examples are inane doodles that add nothing.  Total waste of money.  Total waste of time.  Lousy introduction to the topic.  Aside from the chapter on replacing to-do lists, this book has nothing whatsoever to add to the "field" of mindmapping, and will leave a bad taste for mindmapping in a beginner's mouth.  I have no idea why the publisher picked it up or why it is still in print.  Most readers of this review have probably discovered Buzan already.  The book you need and are probably looking for to expound on and give another person's perspective on the topic is the four-and-a-half-star "Mapping Inner Space" Second Edition by Nancy Margulies, which is brilliantly done and in color (although kind of expensive...) 
    Long before the Christmas shelves were full of film guides and before every publisher caught on that there was a market out there, Halliwell's was king. And far superrior to Leanard Maltin's facile effort, which used to be the only other reference around.     This book was indispensible for a whole generation and was even the basis for a short story. Unfortunately, since his death in 1989, the book has been revised again and again, until now it's almost a pale shadow of it's former self. Think of the difference between The Godfather parts 2 and 3, yes, it's that big a gulf.    Leslie Halliwell's ratings of films had become tougher and tougher on any made after 1960- with only four films from that decade given the four star rating. This was plain silly. His tastes were very conservative, blindgly so some times - with foreign and colour films given shirt shrift. But that rating was a cast iron guarantee that it was something special. Something to stay in for. If he gave a film two stars, you'd stay in because it was going to be entertaining. Three stars and you'd forget your plans. Four stars and you forget the world. And these were very, very rare.    On his death I brought a hardback edition in case it went pear-shaped and crumbled into silliness, and since Mr. John Walker has taken over- I'm glad that i did and wish I had brought a dozen editions. Not only are Mr. Walker's comments very unenlightening, you always got the impression that Halliwell had deliberated over the wording, so that even the briefest critique seemed fully-realised by an educated mind alive to cinema, but not Mr Walker's. Virtually every entry is vastly over-rated, with no glimmer of thought behind the   utterly one-dimensional wording. Every dumb-ass movie, all those passing fads of the last 15 years has been evaluated & given merit way beyond their value. I remember watching one of his first recommendations ('8 Men Out' rated three stars and was in shock that I'd been let down for the first time in a decade by THE BOOK. And it's happened again and again). His contributions have the statue of a third-rate, fickle hacks - from a down-market grungy tabloid.    Some of the ratings are plain silly, The Terminator gets a tight-fisted one star by Halliwell (it should have been at least ***), while Walker gives the empty and souless special effects vessel Terminator 2- two stars. Check out Speed (***), or any of the other dumbed down intended blockbusters churned out every summer to see how they are rated ('Independence Day' & 'Titanic' two stars). Many of these movies are the modern eqivelant of those long tedious wide-screen Epics of the '50s. With Halliwell's original guide, you grew to form your own opinions and argue for your own favourites, like the 'The Ghost and Mrs Muir' & 'The Manchurian Candidate'. Even rock documentaires have been added into the brew and they are a matter of taste in music as much as the cutting and shaping.   The book is no longer a guide to a quality night in. Even worse than all the poor reviews during Mr. Walker's tenure, is the ditching of the forewords and essays by the founder of the guide for each edition, giving his pets hates and his percieved disappointments in the changing face of the media since the last edition. This now robs the guide of a sense of perspective and personality - which would draw in the reader, when it would have been wiser for Mr. Walker to have add his own essay.     Another gripe is the look of the entries themselves. Where they had been streamlined before, tightly constucted, and smart-with italics to denote a contribution of a very high standard, Mr Walker seems to have been playing with those little computer tools of his. The film sypnosis' have been italicised, and anything else he could find to play about with. The italics are no longer eye-catching, there is now far too much information italicised. So that nothing catches the attention. Sometimes, as with movies, less is more.    Anyway, who cares if it's on DVD or Video? This information dates so easily. What's the point? All it takes to find out this info, is to tap it into Amazon. Duh!     In every edition that he has edited, Walker has made huge blunders of judgement and not just in the film ratings and those gripes listed above. There are now several pages devoted to solely listing all the 3 and 4 star rated movies, both by year and alphabetically. One of the pleasures of the Halliwell guides was to find those treasures on your own and because they were so infrequent they genuinely would stand out and then you'd have that buzz of discovery. Not here, now. By providing everything, the reader no longer invests anything into the discovery. This is basic psychology 101.    In this edition he has eliminated 1 star from nearly 25 or so vintage masterpieces that were rated so by the original founder of the guide. EG: 'Scarface' (1932), 'I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang', 'Wuthering Heights', 'The Letter', 'Rebecca', 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn', ect, ect. This serously damages the historical prespective of the early '30s. Those films have a raw primitive edginess and toughness - & they still draw you in. Maybe all the special effects and whizzing camera-work of modern films has corrupted his ability to see this. He looks but he doesn't see. The '40s - an incredible decade is becoming more and more sparse and mundane. 'The Cabinet of Caligari' (a tedious but mightily important German 1919 film) - was said by Halliwell to have been 'faded' but given, like 'A Birth of a Nation' the 4 stars for it's landmark contribution to cinematic-development. What next, maybe 'The Jazz Singer' can be reduced too. The Original was an entertainment guide and educational. The last word can now be scratched off.    This latest edition also features a new gimmick; every page and entry is colour-coded. Yep, not content with with his italic tools from previous editions, he's now got the colours out too. A bright, garish ORANGE for all movie titles, and in between deviding lines, and any other elements. They burn the eyes after awhile.    What this amounts to is a cack-handed trivilastion of another man's great work that goes against the grain of the original, offering huge disparities in stylish presentation, crituques, and a monuemental dumbing down. At each step and in each decision, Walker's Edited Guide has always chosen the short end, the low road, the simplton's way, the talk-down. He has never ever granted intelligence towards the reader/researcher/browser. If a rival guide had wanted to ruin an indipensible book, they couldn't have asked for greater assistence. For those that live in Britain, it's the eqivelent of the esteemed Barry Norman being replaced by Jonathen Ross for the BBC's seminal film review programme.     The work put into this Guide by Walker - change for changes sake - a kind of perpetual revolution for revolutions sake, rather like an insecure political party trying to mould the world to it's image -begets the question, did you ever like the original, mr. Walker?    It's now so 'relevant' and for 'modern' tastes, that they don't even bother to issue a hard-back edition. The story of this guide is the story of the fall of a five star and indispensible family reference book - a landmark in its field one of the nation's favourite reference works -into a mundane a shrivelled ghost of it's former self.    So do yourself a favour and get a second hand copy before Halliwell died, which is the seventh edition from 1989- try 'ablebooks' (http://dogbert.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchEntry). You'll find him tenacious and tight-fisted, but the films he chooses will have some merit to them and you'll amend the ratings of your favourites in your own mind. For newer entries, go for the superb Time Out film guide, which has been the only one to match HALLIWELL'S in quality.....they will give all that you need. Good viewing 
 Ten Wanted Men, as many of Randolph Scott's other fifties Westerns, suffers in comparison to the Budd Boetticher-directed Westerns featuring Scott. Once again, as with some of the non-Boetticher Scott films, this movie has a great cast, interesting plot features, and lots of potential, but the payoff is not as great as it should be.  Scott plays a rancher who takes in a young Mexican woman who is being relentlessly pursued by Richard Boone, who is a rancher coveting Scott's vast land holdings. Scott's generosity toward the woman gives Boone the perfect excuse to start trouble, and he hires a gang of thugs, including Leo Gordon and Lee Van Cleef, to terrorize and try to kill Scott, Scott's brother, and Scott's nephew.  Boone, who is one of the alltime great Western actors, seems out of place as a desperate cad who has to hire other men to do his dirty work. Also, this film contains many elements of Scott's other movies, and rather than seeming fond and comfortable, they seem tired and warmed over.  Scott is Scott, and that says a lot. He was often criticized for his perceived lack of acting ability, but there was a humanity and honesty about his characters that drew audiences to him then, and still works today, making him one of the most appealing American actors. But Ten Wanted Men would have been better served by Boetticher, Raoul Walsh, or another capable Western director 
 I have had this book for about a year and needless to say, I am not even on page 100.  Every time I have tried to read this book, it seems like I am reading about the authors experiences, rather than the experiences she has had with her daughter. It got so boring that I have to put it down.  Every time I pick it up, I forgot what was going on in the pages before. On a recent family trip in the car, I brought this book with me, with yet again, another attempt to TRY to read it and give it yet, another chance.  After only reading a few pages, I said to my husband and daughter, "No matter how I try, I can't read this book!"  The author has taught me nothing about my tween, almost 12 years old.  I only read about HER (the author's) feelings and experiences about herself growing up and things that are happening with her, which hardly touched on the experiences she was having with her daughter or the interactions she has had with her daughter or any conflicts, hard times or happy times she has had with her daughter.  In my opinion, save your money or try to get it from the library.  I thought I was going to read a book about my tween in training, but the best training is going through the daily grinds and figuring it out yourself. There is no better training than to be with your own girl and her friends and being a part of their lives and trying to come down to their level, singing, being silly, and sitting on the floor eating popcorn with them.  Sorry 
 i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it.  i find it a nightmare!  if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out.  it does not work when on the charger.  it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts. what a piece of junk.  I would in no way recommend this product to anyone 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 I bought this to save time.  It took me longer to stem press one shirt then ironing by conventional iron.  It was too small.  I end up returing it which cost me @$25 in shipping cost both ways 
 I also bought this magazine sight-unseen and I wish I hadn't.  For re-decorating purposes, I found this magazine to be not useful at all.  The homes and gardens are pretty, but what they feature (furniture, wall and window coverings) just would not go with the middle-class home...way too opulent.  I was wanting more of a magazine that could give me a look that can be found in local or chain furniture stores... not that would try to make me get a one-of-a-kind table from XYZ Antique store in New York.  Also, I found this magazine text-heavy.  All in all, an OK magazine for a professional decorater maybe, but not for a average home-owner trying to redecorate 
      Paul Johnson generally gets short shrift and quick dismissal as that most dreaded of ink-stained commentators - the "popular historian." Suffering from two fatal defects - he suffers from having his books actually purchased and read in significant quantity, and unencumbered by footnotes or academic cant - Johnson is, three dozen books or so later, nonplussed, and certainly undeterred. Instead, Johnson soldiers on in his crusade of churning out crisp, readable and even trenchant history. Generally he hits the mark more often than he misses. A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY, unfortunately, is largely one of the occasional misses, a misfired product of his youth written (1976) in what must be considered one of the most demoralized and cynical decades in Christianity's history. The resulting book is one very much of its day.   How cynical is A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY? Johnson, in his preface, has the avowed goal of a history of Christianity with "the requisite degree of historical detachment." At no point does Johnson spell out what this degree is or if it is even measurable. Nonetheless, he certainly believed it to be attainable. Johnson, an avowed Catholic, achieves it by a searching and relentless hermeneutic of suspicion towards nearly all comers, but most especially his own church. "Nearly all" - but there are exceptions, for Johnson's narrative leaves no doubt who its heroes are and who resides in the rogue's gallery. And it is in both classifications that the reader gathers a clear sense of Johnson's brand of Christianity - and an uneven (at best) historical detachment. That brand is, inescapably, Erasmian.  In this regard it is worth noting that while Erasmus does not make his appearance until the opening of Chapter 5 ("The Third Force," devoted to the Renaissance and the Reformation), he provides not only only the glue for the entire chapter but the entire work. Johnson's sympathies are not only evident in the disproportionate treatment given to the Dutch humanist - over a dozen continuous pages, to contrast with, say, the two given to Calvin, the few sentences given to Athanasius, Anselm, Aquinas or Zwingli, and the lack of any mention at all of Kierkegaard, Unamuno, or Bunyan - but in the effusive manner in which Erasmian themes come to dominate analyses of crucial episodes throughout Christian history. An Erasmian theology "reduced to the bare minimum" finds little to praise in "the constant and depressing inflation in the vocabulary of invective" (p. 51) of the Church Fathers; the "parasitical" unproductivity of monasticism; the scholasticism, high, midddle or low of the High Middle Ages; the "confident dogmatism" of Calvin and Luther and their successors; but plenty for Pelagius in his doomed battle with Augustine - apparently the chief of Johnson's villains - and John Locke's religious minimalism. Locke and Erasmus, Johnson says, get to "the heart of the problem. What matters is not so much what a man believes as what he does. Christianity is about morals, not dogma" (p.338). From this premise most of Johnson work flows, and only in passing does Johnson hint at the possible vulnerabilities of this approach - Christianity at risk, he faintly concedes, to easily lose its Christian character completely "and topple over into mere deism" (p. 340). Passe Leo Strauss (or at least his popular caricature), Johnson's ideal Christianity is one that makes for well-behaved and productive citizens. "It helps to cage the beast," Johnson avers (p. 517). Which is to say, very Lockean of him.  Such a narrative requires a certain selectivity in treatment, but Johnson's story leaves surprisingly large swaths of Christianity untouched or barely grazed. The virtually nonexistent attention given to Christian history in the developing world is bad enough if tolerable given its marginality to the core of the faith's identity during much of its development. Less escusable is the scanty treatment given to the critical role of the Eastern Churches, which more or less disappear from view even well before the Great Schism. Likewise striking are the large gaps in Protestant history, especially of evangelical movements in the U.S. Johnson's is less a History of Christianity than A History of West European Christianity.   Nevertheless, there are glimmers of the old Johnson fire which no doubt form much of the attraction the book has had over the last three decades. Crackling, even astute observations pepper the work. Not the least of which is the concluding paragraph, which for all its Erasmian language is inescapably skeptical of the alternative: "Certainly, mankind without Christianity conjures up a dismal prospect. The record of mankind *with* Christianity is daunting enough...In the last generation, with public Christianity in headlong retreat, we have caught our first, distant view of a de-Christianized world, and it is not encouraging." While it is likely that A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY would be a different work if Johnson wrote it today, three decades of de-Christianization in Western Europe have lent an undeniable force to Johnson's observation 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 This book was not terrible, but was quite dry.  It talked mainly about how teachers should approach teaching students with multiple intelligences.  One thing I did like though, was that Gardner described his seven intelligences.  This was more of what I was interested in.  It gave me something to personally relate to.  For teachers, this book would be excellent, but for an ordinary person, I wouldn't recommend it.  It's wordy in the middle of the book, but the beginning catches your attention by describing the intelligences.  They also give examples of the intelligences.  The examples make it easier to understand and possibly relate to 
 This is by far the worst book I have bought on the subject of switching regulators. It is in essence a collection of manufacturer datasheets and application notes, thrown together in no particular order... with virtually no reference to feedback design, stability, or considerations for board layout.  I guess all of the author's designs work perfectly on paper, but try building one and making it stable! Not a good choice for the beginner, definitely not a good choice for the seasoned designer 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 This is actually 2.5.  These 2 books are fantasy novels set in a human prehistory in which magic exists.  The twist to this idea is that magic is based on a naturally occurring but non-renewable resource called manna (what else).  In some ways, this is an attempt at an allegory of contemporary dependence on petroleum products. Against the backdrop, Niven and Pournelle set a series of stories about a period when manna is really drying up.  The first book, The Burning City, is a bildungsroman about a young man growing up in a relatively magicless community with an unusual social structure and his later adventures in the greater world.  The second book, Burning Tower, is a quest story in which the heroes, related to the heroes of The Burning City, search for powerful wizards manipulating magic in a malignant way.   These are not particularly well written books.  Plots are haphazardly developed, characterization is weak, and good descriptive writing is conspicuous by its absence.  The Burning City, in particular, is marred by some poorly developed allegory.  Neither Niven nor Pournelle are gifted writers though some of their previous work, both individually and in collaboration, is considerably better than either of these books.  Neither of these books come close to matching their best work, The Mote in God's Eye, a very good novel.  Given these deficiencies, the books succeed or fail on the authors' ability to weave traditional mythology and prehistory into their premise. Here, they are only modestly successful.  Their use of mythic elements is relatively superficial.  I can recommend these books only to hard core Niven-Pournelle fans, and then only if they purchase these books at a discount. 
 Interestingly, I look at this issue in quite a different way. GM food is tested and has been shown to be safe. I try my best to search out GM products and avoid untested organic stuff 
 I had to read this book for a course on Latin America. The author is clearly very biased, if you agree with him you will most likely enjoy the book. Chasteen often states his opinions as fact, stating several times that marxism would have been a better option for Latin American countries (how well did this work in the USSR?) Also, he skips over details that don't support his thesis; while he goes in great detail describing the killing and torture commited by government forces, he never acknowledges the torture and murders commited by guerrilla forces.   The book does cover a great deal of history, but the excessive bias takes away from the credibility of the text and the learning experience. I would reccomend finding a book that focuses more on fact than opinion 
 What ever happened to common sense? In this book the average American doesn't exist. I am not denying the problems that exist in the inner cities. I am denying that this is life for the average American or even the average non-white American. Comparing two extremes - best case vs. worst case is always going to give you an unrealistic picture. We live in a capitalist economy, there will always be haves and have-nots. What he is pushing for is a socialist or communist system where everyone is equally miserable and those that manage to get ahead are then forced to pay the way for those who can't or won't. Hey Mr. Kozol - last time I checked there was no army on the borders of Camden or East St. Louis keeping people from moving out, and there is noone forcing anyone to accept the lifestyle they were born into. He offers a view of the problems with no real solution except maybe to hate the rich - Mr. Kozol, how much money did you get paid to write this book?? Utter liberal garbage. Conveniently leaves most of American schools totally out of the equation, only focusing on the worst cases and then comparing them to the top schools in the nation. 
 We just bought a house and I bought many interior design/home decorating books recently and screened through a bunch in a book store. I bought this one because I saw it was named as a best seller, and I seriously do not understand how could this become a best seller, maybe best seller 5 tears ago? When the book arrived from Amzon, both my husband and I were shocked: Who would want to design like that? The pictures are simply ugly!!! Both the pictures and text are so dated, and the text type is the smallest I have ever seen. I could not bare to read two paragraphs because my eyes were too strained 
 I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get "Born in Ice.&quot 
 Paul Auster's City of Glass is perhaps the worst read I've experienced.  The story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious; the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself; we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated--I kid you not.  The best part of this novel is the end.  I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid; however, I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams.  To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical, existential tour de-force, I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ.  I believe the author had no such thoughts in mind, had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining, dry-dry-dry piece of fiction with one or two not-so-clever plot devices, gather such literary praise.  Like a Rorschach image you can see life, love, death, a myriad of wonderful symbols, and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth, intepret and dwell in that depth--coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life, well, then, good for you.  But in reality, the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster, and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it...hook line and sinker. This novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere, show us little on the way and still receive praise, despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work, in that it plain and simply: sucks 
 Well, I didn't let the negative reviews stop me from ordering this CD because I really like Reba McEntire.  However, I should have paid attention to the negative reviews.  Reba may be a good singer and she is.  But the material on this CD has got to be some of the worst I have ever heard.  The first song nearly made me want to croak and it hardly got better from that point.  Even a good singer like Reba cannot make bad material sound good.  Reba's voice is good.  Her choice of material (especially on this CD) is not!  I'm sorry I bought this.  
 $174.99 is ridiculous!  You guys keep upping the price!  I paid $114.99 elsewhere 
 Accomplished professors Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit essentially bit off more than they could effectively chew in this book.  In a brief work, less than 150 pages they endeavor to effectively discuss, as they note in their subtitle, "The West in the Eyes of Its Enemies".  In summary, they just do not deliver the insights anticipated by the subtitle.  A missed goal is the least of the problems in this work.  In my view, their greatest shortcoming was simply this - they failed to engage the lay reader.  While a short work, this book  needed the skills of an experienced editor. For example, their fourth chapter, "Mind of the West" opens with this "THE ATTACK ON THE WEST IS AMONG OTHER THINGS an attack on the mind of the West. The mind of the West is often portrayed by Occidentalists as a kind of higher idiocy."   Reading this book is a long hard slog.  If you are willing to devote serious effort, some occasional insights can be found.  However, if you seek a skilful tight argument concerning "others" view of the modern West, your time can be better spent elsewhere.  I was disappointed, it was an opportunity lost. 
 First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.  Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now 
 I ordered this book on 6/30/2006, and here we are 1 month later, and still nothing.  I have been notified twice to "update my order".  which basically meant to approve yet another delay for my package.  I love Taschen books, I would love it even more if i could get the darn thing.  
 I am a big figure skating fan.  I have read every skating book out there.  I thought Katarina's story would be interesting. While not my favorite skater, her background would certainly be worth the read.  I was wrong. For one thing, this book seems to be set up in a way where Katarina is giving advice to a fictious up and coming skating star.  Never quite sure if this girl actually exists or not.  Also, this book is preachy and....boring, boring, boring.  Where are the great skating stories, the background info on skating in Germany?  What about Katarina's fears and thoughts on life in general.  None of this in this book.  Skate right by this one 
 Being an avid penguin collector, I have many, many penguin books, but this is definitely my least favorite.  The story is about a grown-up penguin telling a group of little penguins what will happen if they do things they shouldn't.  In the meantime, one of the little penguins is doing all these things.  Even though the story the Nanny penguin tells is supposed to be exciting, I found it a little on the boring side.  I do like the pictures; they are bright and pleasant to look at.  However, the rest of the story is, in my opinion, somewhat lacking.  True, it does have a well-developed plot line, but it just did not seem very thrilling at all.  Younger children might like it, say maybe through kindergarten, but the rest would probably not 
 It was going well...but once it got to part 2 of 2002 they chose some wrong songs, and by this one...they failed!  The singles by Mis-Teeq, Brandy, Monica, Ryan Cabrera, Alicia Keys, & Kevin Lyttle were the only hits 
 The DVD for "The Golden Coach" is for the most part fine, but the final minutes, which are crucial to the full impact of the film, are ruined by deplorable mastering. The scene appears to be out of focus and the colors are washed out to the point of barely being able make out what is happening. I believe Criterion made some kind of mastering error, because Martin Scorsese's introduction to the film explicitly refers to the wonderful restored ending of the film. Criterion should withdraw the DVD and offer a replacement 
 This album is not worth it.  I took my time and listened to all the songs it had, and they just weren't all that good.  The music was strange, and not at all catchy.  The tunes were not popular.  I would say Ian Van Dahl's a much better artist for this kind of music, not Lasgo 
 I expect more from Tom Stevenson as a proclaimed Bubble expert. The book is filled with errors and avoidable mistakes. His opinions are worthy of debate, but by no means definitive. Read at your own risk 
 i like it at first - it looks good!  then i realized it has SO LITTLE INFORMATION! it is simply an overview.  i see amazons selling it at almost half the price i paid a month ago.  it's barely worth that!  go for a more thorough book 
 Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last. We used it only few minutes in the morning, when we need to get some cloth out of closet.  Also, it is not on line product only. I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it. They sell 9.99. Without extra bulb. But still, misleading to say online only. 
 The player was alright for a while but after like a month the display stopped showing any text and then it stopped linking up to my computer properly and when you call customer service at sandisk they are of little to no help. Overall I would not advise this ite 
 She seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i.e. much of today's pentecostalism/charasmatics i.e. the toronto/brownsville blessing (a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic) and hollywood.   In studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine. It was just get saved and jesus loves you. A cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow.  
 Others may prefer that this isn't just a 'greatest hits' album from Disney and has new folks singing the old songs, but to my ear they just didn't have the charm of the originals and not what I want to listen to 
 The passage of time has been devastating for this book, and the analysis of its author.  While it could be argued that the removal of Saddam was certainly a plus for the people of Iraq, it was inconsequential on any geopolitical level.  As was clear to anyone who properly studied the issue before the war, Iraq circa 2003 was no longer a threat to its neighbors, and now after the war this fact becomes doubly obvious.  Those who had experience in Iraq, and specific knowlege of Iraq's weapons capabilities (Scott Ritter, the  IAEA, Hans Blix, David Albright) were pretty uniform in their assessment that Iraq of 2003 was simply not the threat Pollack claimed.  Now that we can easily see firsthand the shattered infrastructure of Iraq, its depleted military, its decimated defenses and economy, it is clear that containment had worked--only too well, in many cases.  The absurdity of Bush's--and Pollack's--claims have been laid bare.  The fact that Mr. Pollack essentially assisted Bush in making a case for an unwarranted, baseless pre-emptive attack and occupation on a defenseless, non-threatening nation is inexcusable.  This level of appeasment is tantamount to a modern-day Chamberlain.  Pollack is not, and should not, be forgiven.  All those who supported this war, freely sacrificing our troops to this unworthy cause, bear a horrible scarlet letter.  The blood of our troops is absolutely on Pollack's hands, as it is on any who supported this war.  Any evaluation on the pros and cons of the war must conclude that this has been a net loss for America, and the world.  While undoubtedly an improvement for Iraqi citizens, it has made the world at large more dangerous, and America in particular more open to pre-emptive attack.  The rationale of pre-emption is now a reality, waiting to strike America, or other nations, at an opportune moment.  The overall geopolitical consequences of the Iraq War are devastating for America, and we now face a much larger conflict with the Muslim world than we ever did before.  Sixty-year alliances are now shattered, and America is distrusted--for what?  A free Iraqi soccor team?  I agree with a previous reviewer--this book should remain in print solely as a warning to future generations.  When otherwise responsible, progressive intellectuals get into bed with thuggish warmongers, the results are disastrous.  I now know what it was like in Germany during the 30's 
 I read this book and tried the diet for three weeks. Although I didn't feel hungry and thought the shakes were okay, I found myself suffering from headaches and just not feeling very well in general. If you're looking for a crash diet, this might work, but I don't think it is a very healthy overall eating strategy for the long term. It does, however, force you to get more than enough fruits in your diet, which I enjoyed. Another thing: you need a good blender and enough time to clean it out a couple of times a day. Sounds silly, but it was expensive and time consuming for me 
 When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times.  I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments.  Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.    If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first.  It is by far his best 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 In 1972, I was real excited about going to a film school and becoming a filmmaker. In the back of this book, there was a list of colleges offering film degrees. I chose one of those listed, the University of Oregon in Eugene. After a freshman year of fun, I went into my counselor and said I was ready to declare my major in film. "We don't have a film school here." he solemnly stated. "But it's in the book!" I exclaimed. I immediatly tried to get into UCLA, but the wait was 1 1/2 years. Thus endeth my pursuit of a film career (I'm now in TV advertising). I found this book recently in a bookstore and sure enough...it still lists U of Oregon as offering a film degree! 
 The Book Description in the Editorial Review describes "the LIFE Scenic Drives Atlas."  Which may be a book that exists somewhere. But it is not this book.  From the description I expected an ATLAS, a collection of maps along with descriptions of marked scenic roads and highways, and included somehow, a photographic record of what these drives are like.  (The review does mention "detailed maps".)  Instead there is a 2 page introduction, two satellite images of the US (east and west) with a red dot for each of the 40 drives the editors selected, and for each of the 40 drives there is a phone number you can call (about half toll and half toll-free) and a web page where one can get information about the drive.    This is followed by about 160 pages of pictures with some chamber of commerce type text and a lot of pictures.  To be fair, the pictures are often excellent and a few are gorgeous.  The text on the other hand is there to extol the beauties or interesting aspects of the drive, and in not at all informative about what the drive is like or even how to get on it.  They depend on the phone numbers and web pages for that.  If it were advertised as a coffee table book, I would have no objection.  But it is advertised as a reference and an atlas which it certainly is not. 
 This is quick revisionism from a hired gun. Perhaps the events of the Clinton presidency are too soon for anyone, liberal or conservative, to be objective, but it will never happen if people keep buying books like this 
 This is a terrible book, written by somebody who is totally ignorant about football (please, use the proper name for the game) and seems to have decided to write a book based on secondary sources, puff pieces and ignorant oversimplifications.   It would take too long to discuss the numerous inaccuracies, exaggerations, mistakes and so forth present in this horrid tract. Just as an example, when dealing with Jewish football he never mentions the peregrinations of Israel through UEFA and Oceania (for WC qualifications). Yet this would be exactly the kind of topic to be dealt with in a book purporting to explore the intesection of 'soccer' (sic) and geopolitics.   Compare this with Kapuscinski's 'The football war' for a vastly superior and more intelligent treatment. 
 This book is full of a lot of great scientific information, however the author's real purpose is to fudge both science and the Bible so that it appears they are one in the same. The author says in the first chapter that he will not try to fudge the Bible so it fits with science yet that's all he does throughout the entire book. His connections are unlikely to convince the average intelligent reader. But don't take my word for it, if you chose to read this book then try this: After every conclusion he makes about the Bible and Science ask yourself 'Does this evidence support the idea that the Bible is true, or is it merely a way of reading the Bible so that it loosely fits scientific fact' 
 I look for two things from a self-help book or tape.  First it should motivate me to make changes in some parts of my life.  Second, it should give me some practical tips on how to make those changes.  This tape fails in both respects.  While the stories are of Keith Harrell's life are impressive, I often found them difficult to apply to my own situation.  And his suggestions on how to improve attitude were vague and didn't give me enough to hold on to.  There were some valuable sections on these tapes, but overall I was disappointed
